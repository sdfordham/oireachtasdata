We both agreed the early years are the most crucial in terms of development of children, with the most critical years being from zero to three.</p><p>  Anyone who watched &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night, as I did, would have been shocked and concerned at the footage that RTE took in a number of cr&egrave;ches.  It is fair to say the programme uncovered cruelty, emotional abuse, physical heavy-handedness with children being flipped and thrown on to mats, verbal abuse and exclusion of very young children.  In many respects it was the very antithesis of what should happen in any early childhood care setting.  There was clear evidence of gross mismanagement of these centres.  There was a fundamental abuse of the trust parents place in the management of these services.  There was evidence of fraudulent recording of attendances to fulfil the requirements for funding under the preschool year and there were clear breaches of preschool regulations. </p><p>  It emerged that 75% of all child care services nationally were in breach of regulations in 2012 and 48% of cr&egrave;ches were in breach of adult to child ratios during inspection.  Would the Taoiseach ask the Minister if, in retrospect, it was a good idea to increase the preschool ratio from 10:1 to 11:1?</p><p>  Fundamentally, there is an issue surrounding the extent and quality of the inspection regime itself.  We still have no inspectors in five of the local health office areas of the HSE: Dublin south city, Sligo-Leitrim, Louth, Cavan and north Monaghan.  The quality of the inspection is compliance-based as opposed to development-based and the model has been called into question.</p><p>  We were promised the Children First legislation and I hear it might not be ready before the end of the session.  There is an onus on the Oireachtas, having witnessed what we saw last night, to work collectively to ensure two elements of legislation that were promised over the past 12 to 18 months are accelerated as a response to the situation - the Children First Bill and the child and family agency.  We are willing to have an all-party committee approach, which we had before in the 1990s during the first Child Care Act and was a breakthrough at the time.  This is a wake up call for anyone who is concerned about this area.  We are willing to co-operate to ensure the Children First legislation is brought through the House as quickly as possible.  When can we expect that Bill to come before the House and to be fully enacted into law?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900003#A00300"><p>I thank Deputy Martin for the manner in which he has raised this matter.  There is nothing more important to this country than the children of the nation.  I did not have the opportunity to see all of the programme last night but what I saw shocked me.  It was clearly an abuse of the responsibility entrusted by parents to people when they hand over their children to have them looked after while they go about their business.  No one who watched that programme could not have been moved by what they saw.  It is important to say all child care services around the country are not as was demonstrated in the worst of what I saw yesterday evening.</p><p>  It is important to say that, from a Government's point of view, we will be happy to work with other parties in terms of co-operation in dealing with the child and family agency Bill.  That will be brought before the Government in the next four to five weeks so we will co-operate with all parties to see the passage of that Bill takes place.  There is an opportunity for the image, brand and culture that has existed for some time to be smashed by the setting up of the new child and family agency.</p><p>  It is not just a case of the introduction of a new agency with a new title that ticks the same old boxes; the programme yesterday evening showed what is happening in a number of cr&egrave;ches.  God knows what has happened in other locations.  Most people in this House have been through this in one form or another with their children.  Any parent can understand the circumstances that apply, and can get an impression of the environment and the atmosphere and the responsibility that is evident in child care centres.  Clearly, the appointment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the children's referendum, the bringing in of the child and family agency and the putting of children's rights on a statutory basis, with the heads of that Bill coming before the Government shortly, are all matters of serious importance in the interests of children.  I accept Deputy Martin's offer of support and co-operation in dealing with these two Bills.  I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in will offer the same co-operation to get this dealt with.</p><p>  It is also important to understand that the nature of inspections must change.  As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has pointed out, the emphasis must be on quality and on a much broader spectrum than merely checking the environment that applies to items such as light switches or water or the general facilities.  This is about the child and should be child-centred in that sense.  Child care is a profession, as is child protection.  I do not like to see this referred to as a business, a sector or an industry.  Unfortunately for some, that is what it has turned into.  We will accept the co-operation of the House to deal with these two Bills when they come before us and we will prioritise them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900004#B00100"><p>I would be concerned at the time lines for the legislation.  After the children's referendum, we were told that the child and family support agency Bill would be ready and the heads of the Bill had been approved at that stage.  The Taoiseach did not indicate the timeline for the Children First Bill, which is the critical legislation on child protection and welfare.</p><p>  There are immediate issues that could be dealt with fairly quickly.  First, will the Taoiseach publish a timeline for recruitment of additional inspectors, crucially, in areas where there are no inspectors for a variety of reasons?  Second, a workforce development plan for early childhood and care staff in education was published in 2010.  We need a clear time line for the activation of that work-force plan because what emerged last evening was quite a significant number of staff not trained.  Approximately one quarter of all staff in these settings are not trained or do not have qualifications.  That workforce development plan is ready to action.  Could the Taoiseach indicate when the Government intends to action that?</p><p>  There has been much talk about the model of compliance and the inspection regime.  I asked last week - the Minister was asked some months ago - whether, given what has transpired, there is an urgent need to bring the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into this area and to ask HIQA to oversee and take over the inspection of these settings.  The public has confidence in the Health Information and Quality Authority's objectivity, independence and capacity to bring rigour, in terms of inspection and the enforcement of quality control in a variety of settings.  There is a need to reflect on that.  The Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, stated that HIQA may, but HIQA has not been given that role.  Given what has happened, I ask the Taoiseach to consider that.</p></speech>

That Bill will be before us here in a short few weeks and I hope we can get that through in this session.</p><p>  The heads of the Children First Bill will be back before Government in the next couple of weeks.  They are complex.  There is a range of challenging issues here.  There is much consultation going on.  In respect of the legacy issues, they need to be addressed in terms of quality, training, inspection, standards and management.</p><p>  As I stated, I hate to hear this being branded as a business, as a sector or as an industry.  Child care is a profession.  Child protection is a profession.  We need a far more robust, comprehensive and quality-focused regime of inspection.</p><p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, will advise the House when she has a response from the HSE on the recruitment and training that is going into the extra inspectors who are needed.  As Deputy Martin will be well aware, this must be about the focus on the quality of the environment and the education for the children.  This is why Deputy Fitzgerald, as a Cabinet Minister, has been strong on the need for the early years focus and the preschool year, which is so important for a seamless transition into the education system.</p><p>  What I saw last night in part is an abuse of responsibility.  We must take whatever measures are necessary to stamp out that appalling situation.  That is why there is a Garda investigation and a HSE investigation going on.</p><p>  When this family agency is set up, I do not want to see it as merely another agency with a new name and the same old standards.  We will not stand for that.  The Minister will supervise it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900004#B00500"><p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I also offer support.  We have a long history, under Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's leadership, of working with the Government on children's rights issues and I am sure the Minister will testify to that.  We also will work with the Government to ensure that children have the proper legislative protection.</p><p>  Last night's investigation by RTE, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, uncovered some disturbing realities.  We should recognise the excellent work done by many child care workers who do their jobs properly.  Unfortunately, this is a business and it is for profit, and we need to face up to that reality also.  The needs of the children in many cases, as we saw last night, are not being met.  In reality, they are being violated - young child strapped to chairs and locked in rooms, daily diaries falsified, children being treated and thrown about as if they were ragdolls.  This is emotional and physical abuse of these citizens and at the core of it there is a failure of regulation and governance.  These breaches are widespread.  There is no adequate robust inspection regime.  We are told some cr&egrave;ches in some parts of the State have not been inspected for four years.</p><p>  The question which gets to the core of all of this - these cr&egrave;ches receive State funding - is how this can happen.  How can taxpayers' money be given to a cr&egrave;che when it has not been inspected?  There are no inspectors in local health offices in Dublin south city, Sligo, Leitrim, my constituency of Louth, Cavan and north Monaghan, and yet these cr&egrave;ches receive millions of euro of taxpayers' money.  There seems to be an overemphasis on the business interests of child care providers and an under emphasis on standards, training of staff and regulation.  We also must recognise that this is a very profitable business, not least because the State is funding it.  Would the Taoiseach ensure that no State funding will be provided without a stringent inspection regime, proper training and robust regulation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900004#B00600"><p>Any incident of a lack of compliance here must be followed up rigorously and changes must be seen to be implemented to the highest standard.  I accept Deputy Adams's comment.  I am aware of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's interest and co-operation in this matter over the years.  This affects everybody in the country and we need to get it right.</p><p>  I share Deputy Adams's view.  Regulation is meaningless unless it can be implemented and seen to be implemented.  This must not be seen as a box-ticking exercise.  Nor is it politics, nor should it be about economics.  It is about our children.  Parents make the choice where there is a preschool year and the money follows the child, but the choice is made by the parents.  Parents to whom I speak have taken their children from one facility to another depending on their particular circumstances.  What we need is a far more comprehensive regime of inspection here.  The brand image of the child care profession must be seen to be of the highest standard.</p><p>  What has happened in the past period includes, not only the appointment of the Minister to have political focus as the head of a Department but the Children First guidelines on which heads of the Bill will come back to Government shortly, the referendum which was passed, and the child and family support agency which, as I stated in response to Deputy Martin, is not to be seen as a new agency with inferior standards.  This is an opportunity to break that culture and improve the brand image with proper inspections focused on the quality of what the children get in these centres.  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 is part of that.  There are 25 additional staff being recruited.  The Minister will respond when she has details from the HSE as to when that training will be completed.  Plans are also advanced to require registration for all child care providers because one wants to put this on a national basis with a national standard.  Whether they are in Belmullet or in Baltinglass, up in Baltray or down in Ballinskelligs, the standards must be the same.  Whether they are for profit or not for profit, this is about children and we will not accept any inferior standards.  We will see to it.  The Minister with the political responsibility as head of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the agencies of the HSE and any other under the legislation for which I thank the Deputies for their co-operation, will see to it that these standards will be implemented.</p><p>There will be no complacency.  I welcome the fact that whereas this programme was a shocking expos&eacute;, it has confirmed that this applies in some cases.  I know of the highest standards being implemented in other places, and in many cases there is online application and visibility for any parent as reports of inspections are available.</p></speech>

That is a fact from which we cannot get away.  No matter how we come to this, there is an absence of trained staff and a lack of enforcement standards.  There is a weak inspection regime, which has led in this case to the abuse of citizens who happen to be small children.</p><p>  The Taoiseach did not answer a matter I cannot forget.  If there is no inspection in a facility for four years or there is no inspector in regions of the State, how can State funding be given to those projects?  A carer looking after a loved one at home is put through a hoop and a person in the community sector trying to get some funding for disadvantaged children or elderly people is also put through a hoop.  In this sector there are millions of euro in State funding being put into a system which I accept has many good examples of child care but which is also an example of a private, for-profit operation where the emphasis is on running it like a business, cutting corners and getting the most profit.  The children suffer as a result.</p><p>  Will the Taoiseach stop State funding where there is no inspection, regulation or adequate training?  If this concerned any other sector, there would not be a question about this.  Why should we put the taxpayers' money into a private, for-profit sector that is not only not providing for our children but in some cases is abusing them?</p></speech>

That is an inspection rate of more than 60% of all providers in each year.  That compares more than favourably with the system applying in England-----</p></speech>

We will find out.  The training of inspectors is under way and the Minister will deal with that.</p><p>  I am concerned that the inspections taking place should not just be about the environment and checking if the lights or sockets are working.  Although these are important, the most important element of all is the child, and we must consider the quality of care and the environment in which children attend a facility.  That is where the focus on the quality of inspections must be centred.  It needs to be far broader, more thorough and more comprehensive than what has applied in the past.  The Deputy and I know that there has been no focus on those under five in this country for a very long time, but this Minister is dealing with a long set of legacy issues going back over very many years and many Governments.  She is the head of the Department with a specific focus on the rights of children and facilities used by them.  This programme will help to focus on the necessity to have quality at the Department's core with regard to inspections, attitude, treatment and care of children.  The early years programme is an example of where high standards can apply with a seamless transfer into the formal schooling system.  The matter concerns everybody and when we get the Bill through to the Government, we will ask for the co-operation of parties in helping us put it through the House.</p></speech>

I gave the Taoiseach notice of this question because I know the issue is controversial and delicate, although we can be reflective.</p><p>  When the Supreme Court delivered its ruling last month that Ms Fleming did not have the right to assisted suicide, it was noted by the court that there was nothing to stop the Oireachtas from legislating to allow for assisted suicide in such cases, once it was satisfied that appropriate safeguards could be put in place.  Ms Marie Fleming still wants the right to die at the time of her choosing.  She remains a competent but terminally ill adult who is in the last stages of multiple sclerosis, is severely physically disabled and suffers frequently from severe pain, which at times is unbearable.  She has little mobility and needs help to eat and drink.  She must be washed, dressed and repositioned in her wheelchair continuously.  She is now losing her ability to swallow.</p><p>  Mr. Curran remains in a legal limbo because although it is legal for Marie to commit suicide, it is illegal for Tom to assist her in doing so, and if he did so he could face a jail term of 14 years.  We all have a right to demand a dignified life, but we also have a right to a dignified and peaceful death.  It is everybody's wish to have a peaceful death.  In light of the Supreme Court statement, would the Government commit to, or even consider, introducing measures that would allow rational and terminally ill people to choose to have an assisted death when they wish, with appropriate safeguards to ensure that the choice would be rational and without external pressure?  We would need to provide the best possible medical care and quality of life for elderly and seriously ill people to ensure they do not come under external pressure to want to die.  Such safeguards would not compel anybody to do anything they do not choose for themselves in sound mind.  They would only apply to terminally ill, conscious and competent adults who can make autonomous decisions and they would not extend to incompetent and terminally ill adults, children or babies.  Such a process would come into play when people's suffering surpasses the will to live, and the choice would be carefully regulated.  I ask the Taoiseach to show some compassion to a woman who is critically ill and suffering unbearable pain.  As I stated initially, we have a right to and demand dignity in life, but each of us as sentient beings also has a right to dignity in death.</p></speech>

If the House were asked to find words to describe adequately the impeccable courage, dignity and compassion of Ms Fleming, it would probably be rendered mute.  When we speak about this particular case, we speak about life and death, but also about compassion, love and commitment, and the commitment of her partner and family are there for all to see.  What we, as the people of the country, have seen in this is something rare and privileged.  It is not for me or anybody else to intrude on the privacy of this family forced by appalling circumstances to share their distress with the public.</p><p>  The court made its decision on 29 April and acknowledged the hugely distressing circumstances.  It held the Constitution does not contain either a right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one's life at a time of one's choosing.  The court held further that the prohibition on assisted suicide was neither discriminatory nor contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The court made it clear that nothing in its judgment should be taken as implying necessarily that it would not be open for the State to legislate for assisted suicide where the Oireachtas is satisfied that measures with appropriate safeguards might be introduced.  This is not the same as stating the Oireachtas should legislate to provide for assisted suicide.  As a consequence of the judgment, the offence of assisting another to take his or her life remains in place.  Such an offence is necessary to safeguard the lives of individuals who are nearing end of life and who therefore might be at risk or vulnerable.  Deputy Halligan made comments to me yesterday and I understand the grief of this extraordinary woman and the commitment of her partner and family, but it is not open to me to give him the commitment he seeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900006#D00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for the compassion he has shown towards the family.  I am sure they are grateful to hear him say it.  None of us ever hopes to have to avail of assisted suicide, and this is quite clear in most people's minds.  The reality is that in the absence of a debate on this issue, very many people like Marie Fleming are being deprived of this freedom to make a dignified exit from this life through extraordinary pain.  In an opinion poll published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 2010 on behavioural attitudes, 55% of people indicated that terminally ill people should have a right to a dignified exit from life if they choose this way.  We know of terminally ill people who, because of the severity of their circumstances and pain, refuse food and hydration as a means of ending their life.  Many doctors are coming forward to state that people are coming to them asking for help because they find their pain unbearable.  I ask the Taoiseach and party leaders to consider at least a debate at some stage in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know whether it would require the introduction of a Bill.  If so, I will do this.</p><p>  Anybody who speaks to Marie and her family will see the unending pain and torture she is going through with an end in sight anyway.  To have to see this end in unbearable pain is undignified.  Not alone as it undignified for the woman herself, as she will tell one, it is undignified for us as a society to allow this to happen, particularly with somebody who is competent and intelligent, who knows she is inflicting pain on her family and friends and who wants to have a dignified exit.  At the very least we have a right to have this debated in the House.</p></speech>

I am quite sure that at some stage or other we have all attended at the bedside of family, friends or acquaintances who have passed on and who, despite the medical attention they received, left this world having gone through a period of distress, discomfort and pain.  I know Deputy Halligan has raised this case out of his understanding and a sense of compassion for Ms Fleming.  It may be possible that at some future opportunity, these matters can be raised and reflected upon at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The court made its decision and is clear, and to respond directly to the Deputy's question, it is not open to me to do this. I understand the circumstances of this extraordinary woman and her courage.  It is distressing to hear Deputy Halligan describe the circumstances in which she finds herself at this time.</p></speech>

This pattern was well demonstrated with regard to the family home tax Bill prior to and after Christmas when two iterations of it were rammed through the House and guillotined.</p><p>The same happened with the Social Welfare Bill which cut child benefit and the respite care grant.  We did not even get a chance to put forward amendments on those items, given the manner in which it was guillotined in the House.  There has been a successive range of issues for which - if they are at all controversial, particularly in terms of their economic impact on people - there is no room for debate, tabling amendments or putting forward alternative propositions.  It is a suppression and stifling of debate.  </p><p> While unions are still balloting and some unions have not even balloted, the House is being asked to rush through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.

Last week's Summit meeting had an agenda which was focused on the two important thematic issues of energy and taxation.  I welcome the initiative taken by President Van Rompuy to ensure that we take time to have discussions on issues of such strategic importance.  Both of the issues discussed last week are highly relevant to continuing efforts to improve the competitiveness of Europe's economy and with that the prospects for strengthened employment and sustainable growth across our continent.  All too often in the past several years EU leaders have gathered to respond to aspects of the economic and financial crisis.  This month's meeting was not about that.  Last week we took the time to calmly and seriously reflect on these critical long-term policy issues.</p><p>  The European Council deals with many urgent issues.  When we meet next month, for example, we will have an agenda that includes following up on the compact for growth and jobs, in which regard I expect we will have a particular focus on unemployment, progress on banking union and steps to strengthen economic and monetary union.  For making space in our agenda this month for discussion of the important as well as the urgent, President Van Rompuy is to be commended.</p><p>  EU leaders also had a brief discussion on the evolving situation in Syria ahead of the discussion among Foreign Ministers on Monday.  Importantly for Ireland, the European Council took a formal decision which confirms that each member state will retain the right to nominate a member of the European Commission.  This decision represents the fulfilment of a promise made to the Irish people following the outcome of the first referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.  I also availed of the opportunity of last week's meeting to update colleagues on the considerable progress that the Irish Presidency has made across a wide range of briefs from agreement on a single supervisory mechanism for European banks to new rules for discards of fish.  Across the board, Ireland as Presidency is working hard and, I am happy to say, making things happen for the European Union and its member states.</p><p>  Our discussion of energy at our meeting last week was a good one.  As I indicated to the House last week, it was set clearly in the context of the EU's efforts to promote growth, jobs and competitiveness, consistent with Irish Presidency objectives.  Secure, affordable and sustainable energy supplies are crucial in that respect.  There was a clear view that it is the right time for a strategic discussion on the challenges and opportunities for Europe in adapting to the new realities of global energy markets.  Our exchanges were informed by a very useful presentation from President Barroso.</p><p>  The impact of the financial crisis means that we are seeing a fall in private investment and tighter financing conditions.  The growing role of unconventional hydrocarbon resources in the US energy mix means that it is on its way to becoming a net gas exporter.  This results in a widening gap with European industrial energy prices and an increase in the use of CO2 emitting coal in Europe's power plants.  International Energy Agency figures indicate that between 2005 and 2012 real industrial electricity prices for European OECD members increased by more than one third, while the US showed a small decrease.  There was a smaller increase for households, at just over one fifth but this is more than double the corresponding increase in the US.  At the same time, we collectively face a significant increase in global energy demand, driven in the main by the growing strength of the emerging economies and pointing in the direction of rising prices.  Global energy demand is set to grow by more than one third over the period to 2035, with China, India and the Middle East accounting for well over half of this increase.  This increasing pressure on global energy resources is should be seen against the backdrop of some countries phasing out their nuclear power production following the Fukushima disaster.  The reality is that Europe is very far today from producing the energy needed to cover its own demand.  Import dependence has actually increased in the past two decades and is set to account for more than four fifths of oil and gas consumption by 2035.</p><p>  President Barroso also pointed out that investments in the European energy sector are currently running at historically low levels, at a time when sustained investment is needed in power equipment, grids, transport technologies, infrastructure and efficient buildings.  As I indicated to the House last week, Europe will need investments in new energy infrastructure worth an estimated &euro;1 trillion between now and 2020.  It is the Commission's assessment that Europe faces rising energy costs under all scenarios but will stand to benefit most from setting a clear decarbonisation path for the period to 2050.</p><p>  Europe's energy agenda therefore confronts us with choices that are far from straightforward.  While acknowledging that there are no easy energy options, we agreed on a series of guidelines that will underpin a sustained commitment by member states in four key areas.  The first area is the area of energy efficiency, including innovative financing of necessary retrofitting investments, which I highlighted in my own contribution.  These are win-win measures that will reduce costs, emissions and imports, while also providing a significant boost to recovery in the real economy.</p><p>  The second area is the internal energy market.  We reaffirmed the deadline set at the beginning of 2011 to have all rules and standards in place by 2014 and all countries part of a common grid by 2015.  We can make significant efficiency gains from more integrated markets in terms of potential annual savings in the region of &euro;60 billion for gas and electricity.</p><p>  The third area is supporting the significant potential for new investments, where predictable energy and climate policy will be key.  We welcomed the Commission's green paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies and will return to this issue next March after the Commission makes concrete proposals.  Our conclusions also invite guidance from the Commission on efficient and cost-effective support schemes for renewable energies and on ensuring adequate generation capacity, while acknowledging the role of structural funds, project bonds and enhanced European Investment Bank support.</p><p>  The fourth area is diversifying our energy sources.  In terms of the geographical spread of European imports, this means making sure no country relies on a single supplier or supply route.  It also means making full use of Europe's own unrealised energy potential.  This includes setting a clear path for greater deployment of our renewable resources, which can also become an important driver of investment and job creation in the real economy.  It is also likely to include developing safe and sustainable ways to bring other non-renewable resources - conventional and unconventional - into the energy mix where appropriate to national circumstances.  The Commission will present an analysis of the composition and drivers of energy prices and costs in member states before the end of 2013, with a particular focus on the impact on households, SMEs and energy intensive industries, including looking more widely at the Union's global competitiveness.</p><p>  The world is undergoing a major energy transformation and Europe must shape its own clear and collective response.  Completing work on the internal energy market will remain of overriding importance and will continue to underpin all three pillars of EU energy policy, namely, sustainability, competitiveness, and security of supply.  The Irish Presidency had already set the goal of agreeing conclusions on the Commission's internal energy market communication at the June energy Council in Luxembourg.  Last week's meeting reinforces the importance of that objective, as well as providing energy Ministers with important political guidelines for their discussions.</p><p>We agreed that energy Ministers will report back to us by the end of the year on the implementation of these guidelines.</p><p> Last week's European Council discussion on taxation covered three main areas, namely, the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes, combating VAT fraud and international measures to tackle aggressive tax planning.  As the holder of the Presidency, Ireland has been prioritising work in the tax area on measures to combat tax fraud and evasion.  We are working closely with the European Commission and member states.  We have an ambitious agenda and are making real progress.</p><p> Building on the work of the ECOFIN Council currently chaired by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, I am pleased to report to the House that this meeting of the European Council sent a strong signal of intent in the area of automatic exchange of information and combating VAT fraud.  The Council had a broad discussion on the recent initiative for a pilot multilateral agreement on the automatic exchange of information.  This pilot agreement builds on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, agreement that Ireland signed with the United States in January 2013 when we became the fourth country in the world to do so.  Ireland has indicated its willingness to participate in the pilot initiative.</p><p> President Barroso also indicated that the Commission will shortly present new proposals for European Union legislation to expand the types of tax information that is automatically shared between tax administrations within the EU.  It is hoped this new legislation will be discussed by Finance Ministers at the June ECOFIN Council.</p><p> The revision of the EU savings directive was also discussed by leaders.  However, not every member state was in a position to indicate it could adopt the proposals at this time.  Nevertheless, it was agreed that the proposals would be adopted by the end of the year.  I welcome that clear statement.  The Commission has been invited to negotiate revised bilateral savings tax agreements with Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Liechtenstein on the basis of the latest version of the proposal.  I am pleased to note that Finance Ministers agreed this negotiating mandate earlier this month under the Irish Presidency.  This is an important step forward in an area where progress had been stalled for a number of years.  Ireland will continue to work towards the rapid adoption of the revised savings directive.</p><p> VAT fraud costs member states tens of billions of euro per annum.  To effectively fight this fraud the European Council agreed that the Irish Presidency anti-fraud VAT package should be adopted by June 2013.  This is a priority for the Presidency and we are confident we can secure the necessary support to adopt this package before the end of next month.</p><p> In the area of aggressive tax planning, the European Council gave a strong mandate for member states to co-ordinate their positions in advance of the G8, G20 and OECD meetings.  Like all other EU member states, Ireland believes in fair tax competition.  Building on the work of the OECD, Global Forum on Tax Transparency and code of conduct on business taxation, unfair tax competition is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p> In addition to last week's European Council discussion on taxation matters, the Irish Presidency, during its term, has put a strong emphasis on combating fraud.  Following the informal meeting of ECOFIN in April, the Minister for Finance, as president of ECOFIN, jointly wrote to all Finance Ministers with Commissioner for Taxation &amp;#352;emeta identifying seven key actions member states could adopt by the end of the Irish Presidency which would make a significant difference in the fight against fraud and evasion.  Agreement on the seven measures outlined in the joint letter is essential in tackling transnational tax fraud and tax evasion.  As I noted when I came before the House ahead of last week's European Council, thus far, four of these measures have been adopted and the Irish Presidency is working towards adoption of further measures at the June ECOFIN Council.</p><p> Although not initially on the agenda of the meeting, the issue of European Union policy on Syria, in particular the question of the arms embargo, was briefly raised by Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande at last week's European Council meeting.  Deputies will be aware that both the United Kingdom and France have made clear for some months that they favour amending or lifting the EU arms embargo to allow the provision of arms to<i></i>the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition.  After a short exchange of views, the European Council decided to ask Foreign Ministers to address this topic as a matter of urgency and the T&aacute;naiste and his European colleagues had a thorough discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting which took place in Brussels last Monday.  Regrettably, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on extending the arms embargo, which will now expire on 31 May.  It is important to emphasise, however, that the European Union remains fully united and committed to seeking a political resolution to the current crisis.</p><p> The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed on Monday that the European Union will spare no effort to create the appropriate conditions for the success of the planned Geneva II peace conference, initially proposed by the US and Russia earlier this month.  Furthermore, member states have committed not to take certain steps in advance of the conference, while the Council will further review its position on Syria before 1 August.</p><p> While the main focus last week was on the issues of energy and taxation, I am pleased to report to the House that this month's European Council meeting also took an important formal decision to the effect that the European Commission will continue to include one national of each member state.  The House will recall that the Lisbon treaty stipulated that the number of Commissioners would fall from 2014 onwards, except in the case that the European Council decided unanimously that this would not be the case.  In December 2008 and June 2009, the European Council noted the concerns of the Irish people with respect to the Lisbon treaty and agreed that, provided the Lisbon treaty entered into force, a decision would be taken, in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, to provide for the Commission to continue to include one national of each member state.  Last Wednesday, the European Council formally delivered on that promise to the Irish people.  Naturally, I welcome the decision, which will be reflected in the new Commission to be appointed next year.  It is an eloquent, if understated, reaffirmation that the European Union delivers on its promises. </p><p> The outcome of this month's European Council was a welcome one as its focus energises on two important policy areas - energy and taxation - which are critical to Europe's competitiveness, employment and growth.  In both policy areas our conclusions provide a most welcome set of guidelines for further work to be undertaken, including by the Council.  As the holder of the Presidency, this is extremely helpful to Ireland's ongoing efforts to progress a range of files across both these briefs.</p><p> Beyond these topics, we will continue to deliver progress, to the maximum extent possible, during the remaining four and a half weeks in the chair.  Our actions are at all times driven by our primary objective of restoring stability, while at the same time supporting sustainable growth and job creation.  I will continue to keep the House updated on all relevant developments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900011#J00200"><p>The best that can be said for last week&rsquo;s summit is that it received very little attention and did not cause any new crisis.  The Taoiseach clearly shares my view that the summit was inconsequential given that he was prepared to postpone this debate for several weeks.  However, the record shows that at a time of urgent need for action the leaders of Europe chose to spend their time on the formal discussion of longer term items.  They did not discuss a single item which could create a job this year or next year for one of the 27 million unemployed people in Europe.  They did not consider any measure which would restore the bank lending that is vital to the survival of businesses and families.  They did not even address the delays in implementing already agreed policies.</p><p>  The summit&rsquo;s agenda was effectively as set out early last year.  It did not include any significant new input from the Irish Presidency and did not reach any formal agreement.  While the areas of tax and energy are important for the long-term economic success of the European Union, they are marginal to immediate needs.  Throughout the five years of this crisis there has been a constant pattern of periods of relative calm being wasted as leaders fall back into complacency.  Inevitably, they wait for new turmoil in the markets before taking long needed decisions.  Unfortunately, we are now in another period of complacency.  There is no discernible movement on any of the urgent measures which should be taken this year to restore confidence and growth to the Union.  </p><p>  Two weeks ago, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, outlined what he considers to be the economic strategy of the European Union.  He summed it up this strategy as &quot;confidence, credit and competitiveness&quot;.   Mr. Draghi, who has been by far the most constructive force for change in the Union in the past two years, said this approvingly.  The problem is that it is the same strategy which has been in place for the past five years.  No one can argue that the current strategy is working and it is unrealistic to expect it to suddenly deliver growth.</p><p>  The highly discouraging decision taken at the March summit on the European Union&rsquo;s budget confirmed there will be no direct stimulus from Europe - on the contrary.  I accept that the scope for changing the current position in the near future is almost zero.  The Taoiseach and everyone else should not speak of this as a good agreement.</p><p>As a result of this, we must focus on other steps that can be taken.  There are four specific actions which could be taken by the Union in the coming months and which would, collectively, have a positive impact on the economy.  These are: support for extra investment by states who can afford it; completion of the banking union; political support for the European Central Bank's new lender of last resort facility; and a frontloading of some programmes in the new budget.</p><p> There are states, such as Ireland, which have no alternative but to maintain a policy of further cutting deficits.  However there are others which have significant room for maintaining or even increasing spending.   The common policy of cutting deficits has made the economic situation of all countries worse, with most now missing both growth and budget targets.  At June's summit, EU leaders will sign off on country-specific economic recommendations.  Ireland and other states should insist that these recommendations should end the policy of uniform austerity.  States may well continue with their self-defeating policies but we should stop endorsing them and should support any states which have room for stimulus spending to implement it.</p><p> The absence of a banking union to go with monetary union was at the very core of the creation of the financial crisis.  The agreement to form a banking union was seen as impossible two years ago but it has now been agreed in principle.  Without this union a restoration of normal credit flows within the eurozone is impossible.  In the context of the core pillars of such a union, namely, regulation, deposit insurance and a resolution regime, the negotiations taking place are at best delivering a semi-banking union.  Without a single approach covering the entire eurozone, the basic principle of sustainable confidence in the banking system will not be achieved.  If the negotiating process goes on for too long and if the final agreements continue to be watered down, a renewed destabilising of banks is entirely possible.  We should not be willing to accept something we do not believe delivers what is needed.  The pace of negotiations must be speeded up.  This matter should be a permanent item on the agenda of full Council summits until it is finalised.</p><p> A rapid collapse of the euro was avoided by the statement from the ECB last July that it would do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to save the common currency.   This marked a radical departure from rigid orthodoxies and immediately restored confidence in European investment markets.  This move was an unequivocal success.  However, it continues to be the subject of regular sniping and the legal basis of the most important measure - outright monetary transactions - has been challenged at senior political level.  If any part of the ECB's new strategy were to unravel, the impact would be severe.  Even with these changes, the euro does not have a central bank which can support long-term growth.  However, it has at least stopped causing major damage.  It is surprising how few political leaders have clearly outlined their support for the ECB's new policies.  This is serious because there has been no push-back against the flawed claims that the ban on monetary financing of governments has been infringed.  There is a clear need for political leaders to address this matter and, at the very least, to prevent any doubt about whether the ECB's new policies are permanent.</p><p> The multi-annual funding framework agreed in March is a step backwards for the Union.  An already inadequate budget is to be cut and the sharpest reductions will be made in areas where the Union is making the biggest impact.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the level of youth unemployment in Portugal and Spain is shocking.  That is true, but what is also shocking is that he and the other leaders of the Union are pretending that they are doing something by creating a fund worth &euro;144 per year to each young unemployed person throughout Europe.  I accept that the deal will not be reopened.  However, there are specific steps which could be taken to immediately improve its impact or at least to delay its most damaging features.  The European Parliament's demand that this year&rsquo;s shortfall should not to be taken out of the budget should be supported.  I have not heard the Taoiseach indicate whether he supports this demand.  Where it is possible to bring forward investment initiatives or support programmes, these should be frontloaded.  The 10% cut in rural support schemes has already been deeply damaging.  We are led to believe that there will be a conclusion in respect of the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy by the end of next month.  I sincerely hope the final deal will preserve family farms as well as productive farmers.</p><p> The final immediate step which could be taken to help recovery would be to ensure that all countries are treated equally and that none suffers disproportionately from the fact that current policies were absent in the first four years of the crisis.  It is incomplete but there is at least today a framework for dealing with banking collapse and sovereign debt pressures.  Some countries, including Ireland, did not benefit from the new measures and were effectively left to carry an unfair burden as Europe sought to hold the line on policies now acknowledged as failed.  As the Taoiseach belatedly put it in October &quot;Ireland was the first and only country which had a European position imposed upon it in the sense that there wasn&rsquo;t the opportunity, if the Government so wished, to do it their way by burning bondholders&quot;.  The Taoiseach does not like to repeat this much because it gets in the way of party politics.  It is, however, a powerful case for Ireland.</p><p> These legacy issues are not some side point of little relevance.  They actually go to the heart of achieving recovery and restoring popular support for the Union.  There is a shared responsibility for the failures of past European policies and this has not been fully acknowledged.  The recent deal on promissory notes represents progress, but it goes nowhere near meeting the justice of Ireland's case.  The entire fiscal benefit of that deal could unravel if the Central Bank of Ireland were to be forced to sell off its new holding of bonds earlier than planned.  If recovery in Ireland is to be fully underpinned, further movement is required.  Specifically, the ECB should not only allow the Central Bank to hold its Irish bonds to maturity, thereby returning interest payments to the Exchequer, it should also commit to returning to each country's central bank the profits on its holding of sovereign debt.  A deal on this has already been of significant assistance to Greece.  If these two measures were implemented, Ireland's fiscal position would see a secure improvement of more than  &euro;2 billion per annum.  Their implementation would also remove much potential for resentment regarding unfairly carrying the burden for the inflexible and failed European policies of the recent past.</p><p> At present, 100% of the space in budget figures about which Ministers have begun to argue has developed as a result of changes in European Union policies on debt.  A more comprehensive and equitable response would make a huge contribution to Ireland's recovery as well as to the recoveries of other countries.  As was long-scheduled, last week's summit addressed the issue of the administration of tax systems, particularly to combat fraud.  Nothing surprising emerged in the final communiqu&eacute;.  The measures involved should be studied further, but in principle, they are to be welcomed.</p><p> The international headlines concerning our administration of corporate taxation were not helpful and, in many cases, were not informed.  This is a complex area and it is simply not the case that Ireland is or ever has been a tax haven.</p></speech>

It appears the US issue is with the failure of their companies to repatriate profits.  It is not that they have been routed through Ireland.  In cases such as that of Apple, one is faced with a major employer which has been here for decades.  Much of the work carried out by it and other multinational companies would be lost to Europe were Ireland not so successful in attracting them and allowing them to make a long-term commitment to growth.  I wish to acknowledge the words and actions of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, during the past week and also those of our diplomats and Industrial Development Agency Ireland.  It has been a well-argued response.  I ask the Taoiseach to reinstate an initiative we put in place in the United States some years ago when similar comments relating to this matter were articulated in Congress and elsewhere.  At that time we took the step of locating in the embassy in Washington DC a particular team with expertise additional to that possessed by the then diplomatic team to combat the lobbying taking place in respect of and the misinformation being spread about Ireland.  It is important we would up the ante in the context of Ireland's presentation of its case internationally, particularly in the United States.</p><p>  The Taoiseach is also right in pointing out how a secure and affordable energy supply is vital for economic growth.  However, he is wrong to say that any major new policy has been agreed or that what is to be agreed this year will play a role in our recovery.  The benefits of a single energy market are some way off.</p><p>  Given that there was room on the agenda to discuss international developments, it was surprising that the leaders had nothing to say in their communiqu&eacute; with regard to Syria.  I have concerns about the position taken by Ireland at this week's Foreign Affairs Council and its argument against lifting the arms embargo on the Syrian rebels.  I accept that this is not a black and white issue.  History indicates, however, that such embargoes are inherently one-sided.  Russia, Iran and others have sold major amounts of arms to the Assad regime.</p><p>Hizbollah, which is a client organisation of Iran, has confirmed that it is directly involved in fighting on the side of the regime.  As such, an arms embargo significantly impacts on only the rebels.</p><p> In Bosnia 20 years ago, the imposition of a supposedly even-handed embargo directly aided Milosevic and caused significant damage to the Bosnian Government.  We should not allow such a situation to recur.  The surest way to undermine an agreed settlement is to allow the regime to strengthen its position or to convince the rebels that they can only win support from the extremes.  The Franco-British position is the correct one.</p><p> Separately, we need to step up Europe's support for democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere.  This week, the secretariat of the European Endowment for Democracy, EED, opened its doors in Brussels.  This was the initiative of Radek Sikorski, a former Polish Foreign Minister, when he held the Presidency of the Council.  It is an excellent development and we should congratulate him on bringing the project this far.  Ireland should commit to becoming a major funder and supporter of the EED.</p><p> I welcome the Council's formal decision confirming that every member state will continue to have one Commissioner, as per the agreements that I negotiated with Europe in terms of the second Lisbon treaty and the Irish referendum.  This should be acknowledged across the board, including by those who opposed the referendum.  We all recall the posters asserting that Ireland would lose its Commissioner if the treaty was ratified.  We took that view on board, as research indicated that people were concerned about the loss of a Commissioner, and achieved an agreement under which every state would retain its Commissioner.  We fought on this and other protocols, for example, corporation tax, abortion etc.  All of these have been delivered in European policy.  Away from the heat of a referendum campaign, all sides of the House and the debate should acknowledge that the particular clarion call of the first referendum, namely, the retention of a Commissioner for every member state, has been delivered upon.  This shows that the voice of the people mattered in the evolution of the Irish position and European policy.</p></speech>

Last week, we had the startling revelation that one Apple subsidiary was only paying a 2% tax rate, well below the 12.5% statutory rate.  It is important to acknowledge that multinationals have brought and continue to bring much needed investment and job creation to our communities.  However, there is a world of difference between corporations that are based in the State and properly pay their tax and "brass plate" companies that funnel money through the State, taking advantage of loopholes to avoid paying tax.</p><p>  Last week in Washington, Apple disclosed that one of its Irish subsidiaries held profits of $30 billion, had three directors, no employees and paid no tax in Ireland or the US.  Yesterday, it was revealed that Abbott Laboratories Ireland Limited, a company registered in Ireland, made &euro;1.8 billion in profit but paid 0% in tax.  Accounts for Abbott Mature Products International Limited cite the company as being a &quot;non-resident Irish entity incorporated in Bermuda&quot;.  It would have been liable to pay &euro;235 million in Irish corporation tax had it not been exempt under the tax code.  When the State is being described as and accused of being a tax haven internationally or by our trading partners, there is some credibility to the claim.  It does serious damage to brand Ireland.</p><p>  Despite the controversy, the D&aacute;il still does not have a full explanation from the Government on whether it reached an agreement or understanding allowing multinationals to avoid tax.  It seems that we are operating two different tax systems - one for big multinational corporations and a second, more onerous system for small and medium-sized indigenous companies and individuals.  As the Acting Chairman will recognise from his long experience, this is not a fair system of commerce and is undoubtedly hurting our domestic economy.  It is contributing to our stagnant local economies, encouraging emigration and keeping unemployment levels at 14%.  PAYE workers are bearing the brunt of tax increases and social spending cuts, yet wealthy, influential corporations are able to escape through tax avoidance measures.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that investment from multinational corporations in Ireland has provided much for the State in terms of job creation and payroll taxes.  These jobs need to be protected.  However, the Government should move to close tax loopholes and work with our international partners, especially within the EU, to improve tax collection efficiency and tackle tax evasion and fraud.</p><p>  We should also be mindful that tax avoidance by global companies severely disadvantages and discriminates against people in the developing world.  Surely we have a duty to stand by those citizens.  There have been missed opportunities during the Irish Presidency, including at the recent summit, to raise critical issues about the developing world and the Middle East.</p><p>  I wish to address the ongoing tragedy in Syria.  The T&aacute;naiste attended talks with other EU foreign Ministers on the crisis this week.  He argued against a relaxing of the arms embargo on Syria.  I commend that position and part company with Fianna F&aacute;il on the issue.  It is disappointing that, after 14 hours of talks, the EU foreign Ministers could not agree a united position on Syria and the embargo.  Consequently, the embargo will not be renewed and EU member states are free to ship arms to Syria from 1 June.</p><p>  While there has been a political declaration to the effect that no one will ship arms for the moment, this is undoubtedly a retrograde step that risks further militarising the conflict.  The reaction of the Russian Government, which yesterday pledged to arm the Assad regime further, seems to confirm this.</p><p>  The war in Syria has already claimed more than 80,000 lives and created 1.5 million Syrian refugees.  Sending more weapons will increase the bloodshed and deepen the conflict.  This risks further destabilising the region, especially Lebanon and other neighbouring countries that are already struggling to host significant numbers of refugees.  The best way - indeed the only proper way - to stop conflict is through talks and building a peace process.  The USA and Russia have recently shown interest in creating a forum for the Syrian Government and rebels to try to start peace talks.  This idea is welcome and needs to be encouraged, nurtured and given more time.  It should also be overseen by the UN and neutral countries with no vested interests in Syria.</p><p>  One must ask whether the Government is concerned about the lack of unity in the EU on the issue, given the lack of discussion and initiative.  I understand that the Austrian Government is worried that the decision could pose a threat to its peacekeepers in the UN contingent on the Israeli-Syrian border.  Is the Government worried about Irish troops serving in the region?</p><p>  It is appropriate that today is the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.  We should commend the work of the Defence Forces, which have contributed and continue to contribute to UN peacekeeping duties in difficult and dangerous situations around the world.</p><p>  Does the Government expect further contacts between EU Governments on the issue of Syria in the coming weeks?  Could it not put the issue on the agenda before the end of the Irish Presidency?</p><p>  Like our spokesperson on international affairs, Deputy Crowe, I have long lobbied the Government on the need to be more involved in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Numerous times, I have raised the EU Heads of Mission Jerusalem Report 2012, which was handed to EU Governments in January but does not seem to have been acted upon.  Israeli settlement building remains one of the greatest threats to the two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East.  The ongoing construction in Jerusalem and the West Bank has ensured that peace talks cannot be restarted.</p><p>In 2012, Israeli settlements in Palestine grew by approximately 1,977 acres and all land expansions in 2012 were approved by the Israeli military order.  The settlements are illegal and against international human rights and humanitarian law.  The Israeli Government is in direct breach of international protocols.  According to a new study by AIDA, the Association of International Development Agencies - a coalition of 80 aid agencies - the Israeli Government also demolished 535 Palestinian-owned structures between May 2012 and April 2013, displacing 784 people, more than half of them children.  This is ongoing war rather than a peace process.  Israeli forces also demolished 30 EU-funded structures, such as water cisterns.  The actions are in direct contravention of EU initiatives as well as the rights of Palestinian citizens.</p><p> In May 2012, EU foreign Ministers urged Israel to halt the &quot;forced transfer&quot; of Palestinian people and to &quot;comply with its obligations under international law&quot;.  One could ask when we are going to do something about the situation.  An active system of apartheid is in place.  One could also ask when the EU is going to tackle the Israeli Government over its breaches of international law.  It will be a significant loss of opportunity during the Irish Presidency if the issue is not put on the agenda before the Presidency ends.  I again urge the Taoiseach to raise the matter at future EU Council meetings.</p><p> I very much welcome the T&aacute;naiste's recent statement that goods from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank should be clearly labelled in all EU countries.  The EU's High Representative, Catherine Ashton, has already circulated a proposal for the labelling of such goods and consumers could, in effect, boycott the goods if they wish.  I have no doubt many Irish people would refuse to buy the products.  The Government and the EU have repeatedly condemned what the Israeli Government is doing but we need to follow through on the rhetoric and follow the logic of the position by not only introducing specific labels for such products but introducing an outright ban on the sale of settlement goods.</p><p> EU agriculture Ministers were engaged in discussions in recent days in Dublin Castle on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We are aware of the significant impact decisions taken on CAP will have on the future sustainability and viability of tens of thousands of farmers.  The current system is badly skewed in favour of a small minority of recipients, many of them not active farmers, who receive the lion's share of the single farm payment.  It is vital therefore that the new system includes a significant redistribution of funds towards the majority of working farmers, many of whom are struggling to maintain a viable income.  No one is advocating that productive farmers should be at a loss but the claim that those who stand to benefit from a redistribution are &quot;unproductive&quot; is an insult to tens of thousands of farmers across this island and in particular in this State.  It is not a valid defence of a system in which in some counties a handful of individuals and companies receive as much in payment as hundreds of others<font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></p><p> I wish to return again to the fodder crisis which is having a devastating effect on farmers.  I met members of Louth IFA last week to discuss it and other issues.  Farming organisations have estimated the crisis could cost farmers approximately &euro;1 billion and result in beef and dairy farmers losing up to 60% of their income for this year.  Teagasc has indicated that dairy farmers on heavy soils could be confronted by a 50% reduction in fodder supplies.  Farmers in Louth and other such counties have been badly affected.  There has been an increase in the number of calls to an emergency helpline and even interventions by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to assist farm families.  While I welcome the efforts made by the farm organisations, commercial bodies, community and voluntary groups and the Department, there is still a feeling that more could and should be done to ensure that no more animals die because of a lack of feed.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must take whatever steps are necessary to tackle the current crisis.  I asked a question yesterday but I did not get a reply on whether the Government has considered seeking support from the EU Solidarity Fund for emergency funding to address the crisis.</p><p> The Taoiseach acknowledged that youth unemployment is unacceptably high.  In this State the figures are disguised famously and historically by the flight of many young people to other parts of the globe, yet there are no concrete programmes to provide work for them.  Austerity rules when growth and stimulus is needed.  Austerity is the mark of the Government and, regrettably, it is likely also to be the legacy of our Presidency.</p></speech>

There has been quite a bit of that today, starting with the announcement in some media that the EU Commission is issuing what were described as "much-awaited economic guidelines for member states".  I would like to know by whom they are much awaited because I did not notice many people at bus stops, in pubs or walking down Grafton Street saying they could not wait for the EU Commission to issue its new guidelines on how economies should be organised in EU member states.  There is a good reason why people in this country are not waiting with bated breath for what the EU Commission might suggest for the economy.  It is because for the past five years they have been victims of what the EU Commission has dictated and directed for this economy and that has had utterly disastrous consequences for the economy and for the vast majority of citizens.  The EU Commission, along with its friends in the IMF and the ECB were the people who said from the outset when the crisis hit &ndash; a crisis they had to a large extent facilitated in the first place &ndash; that at all costs bondholders and banks must be protected and ordinary people must bear the cost of an unprecedented economic crisis.</p><p>  Five years on even they now have to admit that the policy has been a disastrous failure with every single meaningful indicator from the point of view of ordinary citizens showing that the policy has made things far worse, not better.  They have certainly succeeded in protecting the banks and the bondholders, but from the point of view of unemployment, we have a crisis that is unprecedented since the 1930s.  We have a disastrous situation from the point of view of youth unemployment, the future of the economy and society with a quarter of young people across Europe left to rot and who are not allowed to contribute to society.  Finally, our EU masters are forced to admit that we have reached the limits of austerity but its alternative, which we can expect to hear in the &ldquo;much-awaited guidelines&rdquo; is for so-called structural reforms which is a euphemism - the EU admits it does not mean more investment in the economy &ndash; for privatisation and imposing what it calls greater flexibility on workers, which in other words means sacking workers, cutting their pay and conditions and forcing young people to emigrate.  That is what flexibility means.  The alternative, which the EU Commission should be discussing, and which was finally discussed at the EU Council, is to get the investment funds that our economy and the European economy needs from those who are holding the money.  The people who are holding the money are the corporations which this Government is facilitating in dodging their taxes.  That is what we should be doing.</p><p>The Government should end its state of denial about Ireland's tax haven status, own up to its guilt in facilitating corporate tax-dodging and demand that multinationals making tens of billions in profits pay their fair share of tax in order that the country has the revenues to invest in employment and economic growth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900015#N00200"><p>This European Council meeting was billed as a co-ordinated effort against tax evasion to attack tax dodgers throughout the world.  The Taoiseach was highly unfortunate in that the day before he travelled, he was ambushed from the United States.  Moreover, when United States Senators Carl Levin and John McCain made their comments, at least one of them accused Ireland of being a tax haven.  This sent absolutely wrong reverberations around the world that Ireland somehow was in the same bracket as places such as the Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Vanuatu and so on.  This is not where Ireland stands on the tax evasion or tax haven spectrum.  What Ireland does is something different.  While I acknowledge it is somewhat unusual for me to state this, what the Government has done in respect of holding onto the corporate tax rate is utterly right and I urge it to continue to hold that position.  It will be difficult to do so because those in Europe who have been gunning for Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate for so long will take great encouragement from our supposed friends in the United States, who have taken a pop at us and accused us of something of which we blatantly are not guilty.</p><p>  What we do very well is indulge in tax competition, which is rife in Europe.  It would be naive of any Member not to recognise that tax competition is increasing by the day.  Portugal, Britain and the eastern countries all are cutting their corporate tax rates to a rate which is below that of Ireland.  It is more complicated than that of course, because there are all sorts of little sweeteners offered.  In this context, however, one should not forget about the French.  The French rate of corporate tax is more than 30% - I believe it is 33% - but its effective rate is being hotly debated.  It may be 8% or it may be 5%.  Consequently, let not Members of this House, the French or our friends in Europe pretend that Ireland is committing some sort of cardinal sin when the dodges they are up to, if one looks at it that way, are specifically designed to deceive.  I see nothing wrong with tax competition and consider it to be rather healthy.  However, I do perceive the lack of transparency to be wrong.</p><p>  Moreover, the response from the Taoiseach should perhaps have been a little more aggressive.  While the efforts already under way by the IDA in America to deny the story are welcome, perhaps the Taoiseach should have stated that although Ireland is not a tax haven, people should come to look at our wares because Ireland is very attractive and not only does one get a 12.5% tax rate, there also are additional incentives.  Let us not be ashamed of that because there are other legal incentives.  In addition, let us not pretend otherwise; there are special deals.  Different deals are offered to different people not on the tax rate, but in offering incentives to organisations to locate in certain regions or in respect of other allowances that are open to specific companies to attract them.  In this context, I say thank God we have got Google, Apple and the rest here in Ireland and in consequence have those 150,000 jobs plus.  Thank God that GDP has increased by God knows what percentage, as the IDA has stated it would drop by 30% were the multinationals to leave.  This place would be an economic desert without those companies and while this may not be a welcome message, it is true.</p></speech>

While Ireland might engage in tax competition, it also engages in facilitating tax evasion on a serious level.  Regardless of whether Members like it, Ireland is playing a strong role in a race to the bottom.  Do Members wish to see a point at which corporations pay even less than their share and the ordinary citizen is burdened even further in consequence?  The findings of Dr. Jim Stewart, professor of finance in Trinity College who is trying to map out shadow banking in Ireland, are interesting.  He has stated that many of the companies involved are a way of removing assets or liabilities from a parent company's balance sheet and escaping the regulatory requirements that come with this.  He stated that these companies, which are classified as non-trading firms, have a theoretical tax rate of 25%.  In reality, they are able to use write-offs in Irish legislation to ensure they make no profits and consequently have no tax liabilities.  Overall, Stewart is sceptical about the benefits of shadow banking to Ireland and has stated &ldquo;As far we&rsquo;re concerned, we don&rsquo;t get much out of this&rdquo;.</p><p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo in the context of the summit.  I disagree with Fianna F&aacute;il in this regard and agree with the T&aacute;naiste, who deserves credit for the stand he has taken on this matter.  The lifting of the arms embargo definitely was a retrograde step and in response to anyone who thinks pouring more arms into Syria's sectarian war will either topple Assad or drive him to the negotiating table, I do not believe that will happen.  Instead, it will lead to Russia playing a stronger role and matching any arms the French and British might provide.  Moreover, I disagree with anyone who thinks Britain and France actually care about those who are suffering in Syria.  I believe both parties are much more interested in using this conflict as a little bit of escapism from the realities of their political problems at home.  It should be pointed out that much of the western involvement in the Middle East has helped to destroy secular politics in the region and has unleashed the Shia-Sunni conflict that is tearing it apart.  If one considers what the West has been up to in the region for the past ten or 20 years, secular politics has been damaged dramatically by western involvement and what remains is really a Shia-Sunni civil war throughout the region.  As for the idea that Shia and Sunni representatives should be sitting down to have a chat at the table, it simply is not like that, as for these people to accept one another would involve denying their faith and it is deeply rooted in Islam.  However, the destruction of secular politics by the western powers has caused much of the havoc now being witnessed.</p></speech>

Against a background of 26 million people unemployed, nothing short of emergency measures is called for.  Such measures, were they to be effective, would be obliged to take into account that capitalism, as an economic system, has utterly failed the majority, the working-class people of Europe.  In the first place, it was the capitalist financial market system, with its unprecedented speculation and profiteering, that dragged the real economy into crisis and created the present situation.  Moreover, the response of the European Union's economic and political elite says it all.  Instead of addressing that issue, it puts the burden onto the shoulders of working people and poor people within the European Union.  One need only consider the example of Greece, reduced to penury, or that of Portugal, Ireland and other peoples, suffering under the dreadful yoke of austerity, which now is widely recognised to be a total disaster.  In response to the situation, one gets empty words from the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, as well as from Ministers in the current Administration, to the effect that austerity has reached its limits.  However, words mean nothing.</p><p>The statement following the EU summit trotted out the same old clich&eacute;s, relying essentially on the same system and the same institutions that caused the crisis to get us out of it.</p><p> I was interested to note that the communiqu&eacute; drew attention to a fall in private investment across Europe.  It also stated that investment in the European energy sector is at historically low levels.  However, it did not draw attention to what has been in the financial press for the past two years, namely, that &euro;3 trillion, that is &euro;3,000 billion, of accumulated profits lies fallow in the coffers of big European corporations because they estimate it is not profitable enough for them to invest.</p><p> The summit then went on to discuss taxation but did not propose the type of radical action that would be needed, for example, a 60% emergency tax on the &euro;3 trillion that is hoarded by these major EU corporations.  That would release &euro;1,800 billion for investment in substantial job creation and necessary infrastructure and services across Europe to put the youth of Spain, the youth of Ireland and the youth of every country back to work and give them a future, by contrast to what is happening at this time.  Similarly, it did not propose putting those funds into energy generation, clean generation or public generation.</p><p> How can an Irish Government bring any credibility to a taxation argument, however, when the taxation laws and structures of this State are used by some of the biggest multinational corporations on earth to evade and avoid paying billions of euro of taxes?  Those who deny that is the case are denying a reality that is well-proven at this stage.</p><p> The current economic and political elite in the European Union promise only a continuation of the same old failure of capitalist policies.  The masses of European working people and poor people should rise up in opposition and revolt, demanding an alternative, which would be a democratic and socialist alternative, for the resources to be released for public investment into productive sectors of society where the financial institutions are in public ownership and under democratic control, and for a plan to end this crisis to provide a future for the youth and work for everybody who is capable of it rather than relying on the same old failed structures that only promise ongoing suffering and crisis.</p></speech>

I might make some remarks on the key part of the summit on energy and then deal directly with the question of taxation asked by a number of colleagues.</p><p>  One of the realities we must face is that the United States of America will become a net exporter of energy within a short number of years.  The developments in the United States on fracking and the new explorations they have done mean that manufacturing in the United States is becoming significantly cheaper as a result.  If one looks at much of the international literature, it is now cheaper to manufacture in the United States than it is to do so in China because of the increase in economic activity in China and the cost of transporting goods in particular and services.</p><p>  The United States of America has got its act together on energy, and Europe must do the same.  There is a challenge, to take up Deputy Higgins's point, about ensuring we get private sector investment in the energy market going again.  We have said that from day one.  In a circumstance where banks across the eurozone are not lending, we must ensure the framework is right for private sector investment to come in and fund not only public infrastructure projects but areas of energy policy as well.  Good progress was made by the leaders in this area.</p><p>  I understand there are four areas which now must be taken forward.  They are energy efficiency, about which the Taoiseach spoke, competition in the EU internal energy market; getting the investment right - we reckon there is a requirement of close to &euro;1 trillion for that investment to ensure we can become an exporter of energy in the same way the United States has become and China will become within a decade; and ensuring we have a diversified energy supply in Europe.  These were issues of primary importance at the Council meeting.</p><p>  On the question of taxation, on which we heard a number of contributions , I say boldly on behalf of the Government that we have nothing to be apologetic about.  We have not in any way put to one side the views of other people on this issue.  The reality is that major international businesses have located their business in many parts of the world.  They have manufacturing here, trading there, sales elsewhere and intellectual property in another part of the world.  That is the reality of modern trade and of the huge global corporates today.</p><p>  The problem is not the 12.5% corporation tax rate in Ireland, which, as Deputy Ross stated, is entirely transparent.  What one sees is what one gets.  Our effective tax rate is within 1%-----</p></speech>

Our effective corporate tax rate is within 1%.  In France, as Deputy Ross stated, which has a headline rate of 35%, the effective rate is somewhere south of 9%.  There are various provincial discounts that countries employ that could be brought to bear in France and elsewhere.  This is a competitive business.  Even though we are in the European Union, and in many respects we have an integrated policy on a key range of areas, tax is an outstanding issue of domestic reserve within each member state, and that is as it should be because tax policy competition is essential in ensuring we keep business in Europe.  Otherwise, those businesses will migrate to other parts of the world.  We have an upfront, honest position where our effective tax rate is within 1% of the actual headline rate.  That is not the case in other countries.</p><p>  Huge sums of money are being made in the digital economy.  When a consumer buys an iPhone or an iPad, 90% of its cost is not the circuits or the work that goes into creating those devices, rather it is the intellectual property, IP, that goes into designing and ensuring those devices have been made correctly.  The fact that Bermuda can offer 0% to allow the IPs reside there is not the fault of the Irish Government.  That is an issue for Bermuda, the Virgin Islands or many of the Crown dependency territories with which other members of the EU have an extraordinary relationship.  That is the issue no one is speaking about, namely, these huge companies which can diversify at very low if not zero rates of tax in some parts of the world.  We do not have special rates.  This morning, the chief executive officer of Apple confirmed that fact.  It is the position of the Irish Government that every effort will be made to take up the point colleagues have raised to ensure that issue is brought to bear.</p><p>  There are things we can do but we must do them in the context of an EU-wide agreement.  The biggest thing we must do is automatic exchange of tax information.   There is a new gold standard which the US Congress is rightly demanding.  For instance, we were the second country in the European Union and the fourth in the world to sign an automatic tax information exchange agreement.  In other words, the Inland Revenue Service receives from the Irish Revenue on an annualised basis the tax affairs of companies and of US individuals in this country and <i>vice versa</i>.  That is the new gold standard on which the OECD and the United States are looking to come into agreement, and that is the standard we are seeking to employ across the European Union in our work as holders of Presidency.  We have nothing to be ashamed about or to apologise for in this area.  We have a very strong record of tax compliance in this country.  That is the way it should be, and that is the way it will continue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900016#O01000"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that clarification.</p><p>It is an issue that has arisen in recent days as a result of a Senate hearing in the United States that sought to portray Ireland as a tax haven.  The designation "tax haven" has some serious connotations.  I am disappointed, notwithstanding the remarks of the Taoiseach at home, that while Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union, he has not taken his case to the United States this week, to go to Capital Hill to say not necessarily to parliamentarians but to the corporate world in the United States that Ireland is not a tax haven and that under the EU structures, no state within the Union can be classified as a tax haven.  The connotations attached to the term tax haven conjure up all sorts of negative viewpoints for companies and investors in this country and Europe generally.</p><p> Why has the Taoiseach not taken it upon himself, while holding this important office for the next number of weeks, to make our case in the United States not just on behalf of Ireland but on behalf of the European Union?</p></speech>

I have raised this a number of times with the Taoiseach so I will not rehearse it now.  Can we get a commitment that it will be on the agenda during the Irish Presidency and acted upon because this report was issued by the EU Heads of Mission themselves?</p><p>  Has the Government considered seeking support from the EU solidarity fund to address the fodder crisis?  Austria had a similar crisis in 2002 and was able to secure funding from the solidarity fund.</p></speech>

If that is the case, could the Minister of State explain to me and the public why the European Union's own website, which shows figures for the implicit corporate tax rate across Europe, states that Ireland's implicit tax rate is 6.8%?  Contrary to the Minister of State's remarks about France, the website shows France's corporate tax rate at 21.6%, Germany's at 17.1%, Greece's at 17.8%, Sweden's at 27.2% and Britain's at 17.7%.  According to the EU Commission, our corporate tax rate is a fraction of the average across Europe.  I am not saying it, the Commission is saying it.</p><p>  Could the Minister of State respond the remarks of a former senior staff member in Google, who sent me an e-mail?  He said that Google Ireland had a turnover of &euro;47 billion between 2005 and 2011.  The profits over that period were a minimum of &euro;9.5 billion.  Over that period, the company paid taxes of &euro;69.91 million, a 0.7% tax rate.  It is another company to add to the list, along with Apple and Abbot Laboratories.  How can the Minister of State tell us we have a transparent corporate tax system when that is a reality?</p><p>  This person explained how this works with Google.  Google Ireland Holdings owns the internal systems and software the advertising network runs on.  Google Ireland employs people, charges clients money and makes those profits.  Google Ireland pays a licence fee to Google Ireland Holdings for the use of that software and in a strange coincidence Google Ireland Holdings Limited charges a fee that is almost exactly the amount Google Ireland Limited makes each year.  Of course, the fee changes each year to match the growing profits.  That is what is known as the double Irish; that is how it works, it is a tax dodge and we facilitate it.</p></speech>

That is why when people extrapolate a rate of 2% or 3%, they are putting into all accounts the great majority of work that has no connection to this country.  We tax what goes on in this country and for which we are responsible.  We are not responsible for a relationship that might exist between a corporate entity and another tax authority where an element of that business resides.  We are not responsible for that.</p><p>  The gold standard in respect of the international community comes from the OECD and I refer the Deputy to the report of the OECD and the World Bank which has confirmed the Irish effective tax rate is 1% to 1.5% away from the actual headline tax rate.  Why do I say the OECD is important?  Because in the last two decades movement in this area has been clearly led by the OECD which recognises huge sums of money are being lost to domestic governments all over the world.  The Taoiseach spoke about VAT fraud earlier but there are many other ways in which corporates can effectively organise their affairs to reduce their tax liability.  The real issue for US multinational companies is to bring those profits back to the United States, where they are taxed at between 10% and 35%.  Once they do that, those funds are not available to the businesses.  That is the real issue and that can be resolved overnight in the United States if Congress decides to implement a law in that regard.</p><p>  The OECD has led on this issue.  That is why we have 69 separate double taxation agreements with countries around the world.  That is why we have this automatic tax exchange agreement with the United States, which incidentally is becoming the way in which the Europeans are going to negotiate with our colleagues in America.  America tells us it wants this automatic tax exchange information on an annual basis for the companies and individuals in Ireland.  We can now do that: it is a totally transparent system.  The real issue is if the 26 other member states of the European Union will come to that agreement.  The logic of the position is that we should have a common position with the US on this issue and we are working to achieve that.</p><p>  Deputy Adams asked about the EU Heads of Mission report on Jerusalem.  I agree that it should be put on the agenda and we will work to see if we can obtain agreement on that between now and the end of the Presidency.  I will get the Deputy the information on the emergency funding for fodder.  If it is possible the fund would become available, it would make sense to use it.</p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is in Brussels regularly to see exactly what additional support can be obtained, but I will get the Deputy the latest position on the matter.</p><p> Deputy Dooley asked why the Taoiseach is not going to the United States this week to beat his breast about this issue.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach spends a considerable amount of time in the United States of America drumming up business, ensuring the Irish story is understood, and as President of the European Union, and he will continue to do that.</p><p> Deputy Dooley did not refer to this matter of tax haven; Deputy Boyd Barrett did.  This is a dangerous business.  We are talking about more than 150,000 good well-paying jobs, directly and indirectly in this country.  These jobs, in manufacturing, financial services, distribution and IT, are putting significant numbers of our people to work.  We have managed to get those companies to this country, not only because of the 12.5% corporate tax rate but because we are English speaking, we are in the eurozone-----</p></speech>

That is why US businesses are coming to Ireland and creating employment in this country.  The Taoiseach continues to drive that investment pipeline and day in, day out the agencies are working hard to ensure the Irish success story is understood in the United States of America.</p><p>  As to the argument of a tax haven, let us be clear that it is not the view of the US President.  It is not the view of his Administration, of the Under Secretary of State for International Trade and of members of President Obama's Cabinet.  This phrase about a tax haven in the case of Ireland is bandied about by some members of the US Senate and Congress.  Why would the President of the United States entertain any visit to this country if we were an alleged tax haven?  People need to realise that we should not get sucked into a game.</p><p>  The same is the case for the British on this issue.  Recently, the British, in their tax law, introduced a new royalty payment of approximately 10% - an extraordinary write-off for businesses.  The city of London has very interesting ways in which subsidiary companies can fund other business, in terms of finance, at zero per cent.  They have done that because of tax competition as well.</p><p>  We should not be led by the nose, either by a US congressional committee or by the mother of all parliaments.</p></speech>

I would agree with him.  I would have thought these are two mavericks who are having a go and being irresponsible.  In that light, perhaps he could respond as to what is official United States policy about our corporate tax rate and corporate tax behaviour.</p><p>  From memory, the US President, before he came to office, made part of his campaign slogan that he would force US companies to repatriate their profits and he singled out, targeted, fingered and named Ireland when he did so.  Has that changed?  Are we out of danger in that regard or is the pressure there still?</p><p>  As a subsidiary to that, I note IDA Ireland is out there this week.  Mr. Barry O'Leary went out immediately when this little episode broke.  Would the Minister of State tell us whether the pressure from Europe to increase our corporate tax rate, which was so strong when the Taoiseach came to office and which the Taoiseach appears to have put off so successfully, is increasing again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900018#Q00700"><p>On the latter issue first, of course, Deputy Ross is correct.  When we came into government, it was then French President Sarkozy who was raising this issue on a fairly persistent basis that Ireland should do something on its corporate tax rate if it wanted to close the gap between tax and expenditure.  Mr. Sarkozy is no longer there and our corporate tax rate remains.  We are in agreement with the French Government and others who believe it is important to have a competitive approach to taxation policy.  That issue is not one that is regularly brought to our attention.  Other countries will attempt to move on other issues, for instance, the financial transaction tax, FTT, on which a number of countries are moving, although whether they are moving all at the same time is an issue which I would be interested to debate with them at some point.</p><p>  On the first issue, Deputy Ross is also correct in stating that President Obama, before he was elected five years ago, raised this issue.  It did not seem to be an enormous priority in the first term.  I suspect in the second term, because of the deficit position in the United States, he will take action to see how much profits can be repatriated.  The issue was about the repatriation of profits, but that can be resolved in the United States.  It can be resolved in an agreement between, presumably, the US Administration and Congress.  Whether that agreement is to be forged is a matter of US domestic politics on which I am not able to comment, but in so far as the bilateral discussions between the US Administration and the Irish Government are concerned on this issue of the corporate tax rate or the repatriation of profits, it is a global issue for the United States.  It is not specific to Ireland.  That is the point I am raising.  We can get too far ahead of ourselves on this, give too much attention to two members of Congress for their interesting observations and assume that such is the automatic view of the US Administration.  That would be a dangerous presumption to make</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900018#Q01400"><p>When speaking last night, I stated that the position on increments is inequitable and untidy.  The Government must decide for the future whether there will be an increment system or a flat rate system and then it must stick consistently to one system or the other.  As I stated, a person on the bottom rung of the ladder and moving up is at a disadvantage compared with somebody at the top of the scale who got the full increment and for whom this measure will not have any effect.</p><p>  Regarding pensions, whether it is in the tax code, in pensions or in any other code, in my experience people like there to be a transparent, equitable and understandable system.  I noticed in negotiations over the years, for example, in the taxation of social welfare benefits, that where there are all sorts of systems operating for different recipients, it is difficult for the citizen to understand.  Over recent years, we have arrived at a position in the case of public service pensions where it depends on when one went out on pension as to what pension one will get, and staff with the same service could wind up with different pensions depending on the date on which they left the public service.  When the Minister is summing up, perhaps he would confirm whether it is correct to state that the Bill adds to rather than solves this problem.</p><p>Until now it was reasonably simple in that for an ordinary public servant with 40 years of service, there would be a half-salary as pension.  Everybody could work it out as if a person had 20 years of service, the pension would amount to a quarter of the final salary.  It was transparent, simple and understandable.  As I stated last night, my party deviated from this process as we did not reduce pensions in line with salaries.  I am not convinced, in the long term, that it was the right decision.  I had hoped that we could reconnect pensions to salary with a simple formulation.</p><p> The explanatory memorandum of the Bill and the legislation itself does not indicate if this will happen so perhaps when the Minister of State replies, he could put my mind at rest and tell me that when the Bill comes into force, all pensions will amount to 50% of final salary, taking in normal calculation of pensionable income.  If the Bill is not doing this, we will be adding to all the anomalies.  My concern is that with all the side deals, instead of this Bill being the intended reform, it will have anything but that effect.  With all the different deals done in recent weeks to get Croke Park II turned into the Haddington Road agreement, the Government will only be adding to the anomalies and complexity of the system.  The short-term benefits of this are far outweighed by long-term disadvantages.</p><p> There has been some talk about Haddington Road being in Dublin 4 but I ask the Minister of State to check if that road goes beyond the traffic lights as this should be the Beggars Bush agreement.  I suggest the Minister of State checks whether the agreement was made on Haddington Road or if, for some reason, there was a reluctance to have a pay agreement connected to a place called Beggars Bush.  Perhaps he could clarify that in his summation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900019#R00300"><p>Dublin 4 perhaps but not Dublin 6.  The Croke Park agreement was quite effective, when management worked it well, in bringing about necessary reform in the public service.  I believe in protecting low-paid workers and paying people correctly.  As I stated earlier, the differential between high and low paid is too wide, not only in Irish society but across the Western world.  There are finite resources and over-rewarding the top end is unfair, whether that is with public servants, people in the private sector, star sports people etc.  Ultimately, the ordinary punter will be paying the very high salary.</p><p>  I also believe in good practice.  My experience of public servants is that they have been very open to new technology and good work practices, although a small coterie of people in the public service over the years have objected to every change in practice, even if it would lighten the work burden.  This has been damaging to the interests of public servants as some of this small coterie have been quite powerful in public service unions.  The idea of the Croke Park agreement was to eliminate such issues.  Many people would say that getting answers and decisions from the system has become a painful operation.  When we consider the system, an inability to get simple answers to simple questions fast in certain sections is unjustifiable.  It is the job of management to work with employees and most ordinary public servants would much prefer to work in an atmosphere where a job is getting done and they are not getting grief from the public.  This needs a radical change in work practices.</p></speech>

I hope making the public service a better place in which to work will be central to what we are doing.  We must work with public servants and ensure that good work practices will dominate, with those who are obstructing progress and a better workplace told that according to the terms of the Croke Park agreement such obstruction will no longer be acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900019#R00600"><p>In the first instance I thank all colleagues who contributed to the debate.  We appreciate the points made.  I also put on record my thanks and that of the Government to the extraordinary work of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Mulvey and his team for the work in the past five or six months.  I also thank our own officials for their extraordinary input on behalf of the Department and the Government in bringing this matter to a conclusion.</p><p>  This country has gone through an enormous adjustment process somewhere in the region of &euro;25 billion, achieved by way of tax increases and expenditure cuts since the beginning of the crisis.  We are 85% of the way there and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has repeatedly stated on behalf of the Government that it is not unreasonable in circumstances where approximately 38% of all Government expenditure relates to public sector pay and pensions that between now and 2015 a third of the adjustment should come by way of proposed new efficiencies in order to get the country back to a manageable deficit.  That is where we obtained the &euro;1 billion figure for an annualised saving by 2015.  That is not an unreasonable position for the Government as an employer to take in circumstances where the deficit figure is still as difficult as it is.</p><p>  It is also right and proper that there has been extraordinary buy-in by the public servants of this country.  They have been caught in an extraordinary storm which at one level saw take-home pay diminish in recent years because of this crisis but at another level the demand for services - in the likes of education, health and elsewhere - has exponentially increased.  Much more work is being done by a smaller group of people because we have reduced numbers in the public service from a maximum of 320,000 to just under 290,000 today.  This &quot;perfect storm&quot; in which Ireland has been caught is the context.  If we can achieve our aim with a managed process - albeit a new agreement where the Government effectively comes into a collective arrangement with each separate union or group of unions - that is all the better.</p><p>  There was an allegation in the debate that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is in some ways bullying unions by having this legislation in place.  It is far from it.  We gave a commitment as a Government that whatever agreement was achieved would apply from July of this year to July 2016.</p><p>This is the three year period about which we speak.  The only way in which these changes must be made is through the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation which was introduced by the previous Administration as a necessary emergency measure to deal with the financial crisis.  There is no bullying in having the legislation running parallel to the 1 July deadline for when these changes must happen and the negotiations.  We refute and reject this.</p><p> Deputy Fleming and others raised the issue of the reducing headcount and there was criticism of the ongoing fall in numbers and of the burden this is placing on the remaining staff.  I recognise it places extraordinary pressure on the remaining staff but we must do things differently.  A great benefit of the Haddington Road agreement is the change in the average number of hours people work.  Approximately 18 million additional hours will be obtained by the agreement which, if added up, are worth approximately 10,000 full-time equivalents.  If people can work longer in a circumstance of managing the adjustments, we will be able to do much more with the existing service.  This is an example of the new efficiencies which will flow from the agreement.</p><p> I refute Deputy McDonald's claim that an increase in working hours is the same as a pay cut.  On the contrary, it is only through the negotiated increase in working hours for the majority of public servants, to 37 or 39 hours as appropriate, that we are able to avoid wider and deeper pay cuts for public servants.  The boost in productivity which the additional hours will bring to our public services will be good for everyone in the country.  The additional 18 million hours on an annualised basis obtained by the agreement are an example of what we can do by way of an agreement.</p><p> On a side note, I was startled to hear Deputy Finian McGrath claim that &euro;65,000 is not a large salary in Ireland today.  On the contrary, it amounts to twice the average industrial wage in Ireland.  It is a fair level at which to apply pay reductions starting at 5.5% and increasing progressively but proportionately to 10% at the highest levels of pay in the public service.  In contrast, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was dismissive of the amount of the pay cut at this level.  I find this difficult to accept from a member of a Government in which the then Taoiseach was paid a salary of &euro;310,000.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900020#S00300"><p>It is true it was cut, but these cuts have continued in a progressive and proportionate way.  It is right and proper that those who have most are burdened most in the adjustments.  The measures in the Bill mean the Taoiseach's salary will go from &euro;185,000 to &euro;167,000.  We have gone from a salary under Fianna F&aacute;il of &euro;310,000 to a salary of &euro;167,000 in a short number of years.  This is what I call leadership.</p><p>  A number of Deputies raised the issue of the lack of consultation with public service pensioner groups about the introduction of revised public service pension reduction, PSPR, measures.  It is worth pointing out when the first PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 there was absolutely no consultation with any pensioner groups and the measure was introduced unilaterally.  On this occasion the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has introduced a further PSPR measure which will impact on less than a quarter of public service pensioners and the Minister and officials have met the Alliance of Retired Public Servants.  He felt it was very important to show them the courtesy of meeting them to listen to their very genuine concerns and explain to them why, in the interests of equity, it was necessary that a further contribution would be sought from higher paid pensioners.  As the Minister explained to them, it gives the Government no pleasure to have to take these measures, and we would all genuinely wish economic circumstances were otherwise, but the reality is the Government must take steps to ensure the economic survival of the State and this impacts throughout society.  The additional reductions of between 2% and 5% could not be regarded as excessive, particularly at the lower bands.</p><p>  On the question of representation, the Minister indicated to the Alliance of Retired Public Servants there would be advantages for public service pensioners and the Government to having a formalised structure, such as the alliance, for ongoing engagement on public service pension matters.  I know Mr. Mulvey alluded to this in his remarks over the weekend.  Effectively, they were not part of the process because they are not employees of the State; they are pensioners under existing conditions.</p><p>  On a point of clarification, there was some confusion that the new PSPR rates applying to pensions of &euro;32,500 would also be applied to spouses' pensions at &euro;16,000.  This is not correct.  The only spouses' pensions that will be affected by these measures will be those spouses' pensions which are themselves over the &euro;32,500 threshold.  Retired public servants on a pension of &euro;32,500 will have no reduction.  The additional contribution or reduction, call it what one will, only kicks in at &euro;32,500 and is progressive from 2% to 5%.</p><p>  The issue of targeting gold-plated pensions for very senior former officeholders and public servants was also raised.  However, in introducing emergency legislation the Government must ensure the measures introduced are proportionate and reasonable if they are to be deemed constitutional if challenged.  I am satisfied the very progressive reductions being sought from higher pensioners meet these legal criteria.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming also asked for the Government's estimate of when the financial emergency would end.  I cannot, unfortunately, guarantee that the crisis will end on a particular day or in a particular month.  However, I can guarantee Members of the House and public servants who are being asked for another sacrifice that the Government and the officials in the Department are working hard to bring this day about as soon as possible.</p><p>  None of us is jumping down the streets with the introduction of this legislation because of the effect it will have, but the fact we have come to a measure of agreement with organised labour in the Irish public sector is an extraordinary contribution by the public service unions of the country and to where the country is right now.  These public servants have made an enormous contribution to the rehabilitation of Ireland and we are nearly there.  This final piece of the jigsaw, difficult as it is in terms of putting the legislation through Parliament, will not only ensure the viability of the State but, more importantly, the viability and sustainability of public servants themselves and it is in their long-term interest.  It is not in the interest of public servants to have an enormous difference between tax and expenditure because we will not be able to afford to pay the pensions they legitimately expect from their working lives.  This is about the sustainability of the State, but it is also about the sustainability of public service pay and pensions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

This service offers a dedicated helpline, website and financial advice which is available to borrowers from independent accountants, the cost of which is being borne by the lenders via the Irish Banking Federation.  Supporting people in difficulty with their mortgages is a key priority for Government.  In this regard, and in the context of the establishment of the personal insolvency service, the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears strongly endorsed the recommendation of the interdepartmental working group to have a very comprehensive information campaign to promote awareness of the Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service which includes the helpline, website and accountancy advice.  In this regard, the working group had proposed that the CIB, which has major expertise for the provision of information and had already established the helpline and the website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i>, would be the most appropriate body to undertake this important campaign.  The CIB made a decision on that basis to proceed with a single tender contract.  It was further agreed that the costs should be borne by the lending institutions - the banks - and this was successfully negotiated with the Irish Banking Federation.  Therefore, this campaign involves no cost for the Exchequer as it is fully funded by the lending institutions.</p><p>  The total value of the work commissioned amounted to &euro;80,400.  This was based on standard rates for work of this nature and the costs were divided between the designers of the campaign - just over &euro;15,000 - and their media partner who organised the media time - &euro;65,000.  Since the campaign was run, I am pleased to see that there has been an increase in the numbers of people accessing the helpline and the website.  The campaign consisted of a two-week radio campaign involving local and national radio, a series of newspaper advertisements in national media over a three-week period and an online display advertising campaign which ran for four weeks.  Since July 2012, the Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service helpline has received over 5,000 calls and there have been over 100,000 visits to the website.</p></reply>

However, I have here a list of the Citizens Information Board, CIB, contracts issued for one month, March 2013.  There was a contract for Downey Cleaning Services in the amount of &euro;7,901, and five people were contacted to tender for that.  A contract was given to Northside Community Law Centre for training in an amount of &euro;3,930, and three quotations were sought for that.  There was a contract for Performance Management and Development System, PMDS, training - &euro;5,200 - and, again, three quotations were sought for that.  A contract was awarded to Reads for photocopying the Citizens Information Services employer and staff handbook, which was for an amount of only &euro;2,240, but five quotes were sought for it.</p><p>  It seems a little strange, to say the least, that the majority in value of the contracts issued by this organisation, under the aegis of the Minister's Department, for the month of March went out without any tender.  What criteria are used to select a person to offer a contract like this to without the necessity of tendering?</p></speech>

The CIB was requested to do this by the interdepartmental group, the group working on mortgages, because of the desire to get people who are indebted with mortgage debt to be in contact with their lenders, and to offer those people an advisory service.  The dedicated helpline was established last year and it has been updated for all the changes in the law.  The accounting advice is provided by the various members of accounting bodies throughout the country.  The decision and request by the interdepartmental group, which included the Department of Finance and representation from the Central Bank, was that an information campaign should be launched.  The CIB was asked to do this and it proceeded with a single tender on grounds of urgency.  As I said, the cost was divided between the designers of the campaign and the media partner, which organised the media time.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister might outline what criteria are generally used by agencies under the aegis of her Department to give out contracts of this kind without inviting tenders.

As a former Minister, the Deputy is aware that in situations of urgency provisions are made for single tenders.  Given that few issues are more urgent than assisting people in trouble with their mortgages and getting information to them, that was the context in which the Citizens Information Board, CIB, was requested to carry out this work and, because it was asked to do so on an urgent basis, it went with the single tender.</p><p>  The board of the CIB is the Accounting Officer.  I will approach the board and the chief executive in order to get the further information the Deputy requires.  I would not have access to, or would not look in detail at every tender and event that happened in the CIB.  It has a board, a chief executive and staff.  As the Deputy is probably aware, there is a considerable expenditure of public money between the CIB and MABS to provide services for people in terms of information and, especially in the current climate, to provide information on indebtedness.</p></speech>

The FIS payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.   Some people may believe that taking up employment might only offer a marginal improvement to their income.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for e<font color="#2F2F2F">xpenditure on FIS of nearly &euro;230 million in 2013.</font>  There are currently just over 40,440 families benefiting from the FIS scheme.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Given that we have discussed this issue on previous occasions, I am happy to inform the Deputy that the processing of all FIS applications, both new and renewed, made to my Department are fully up to date</font> and all backlogs have been eliminated.  I have informed the Deputy about all the changes in IT we were implementing.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">To qualify for payment, a person must be engaged in full-time, insurable employment, which is expected to last for at least three months, and must be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight, or 19 hours per week.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below an income threshold, which varies according to the number of qualifying children in the family.  </font></p><p>  A comprehensive and easy to understand information booklet and application form are available on the Department's website.  In this regard it should be noted that since 16 January 2013, the date on which the new departmental website was launched, the FIS pages have received almost 40,000 page views, which indicates the strong interest in the scheme.</p><p>  FIS income thresholds have been maintained at the same level since 2010.  Prior to this, FIS income thresholds had risen broadly in line with equivalent social welfare rates so as to maintain their value relative to unemployment payments.  A change in FIS income thresholds would have financial implications which would have to be considered in the context of the budget.  There are no plans to do so currently.  More generally, I recognise that creating jobs and tackling poverty are the key challenges.  In this context, FIS plays an important role.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900023#W00700"><p>I welcome the news that the backlog has virtually gone and that FIS applications are on track.  It is a useful scheme because increasing numbers of people who are in reduced employment because of the downturn and whose overtime and hours have been cut are now finding themselves to be a working poverty group in Irish society.  Is there any indication why so many are not applying?  There is an indication that quite a number of those who would be able to avail of this service do not do so although it appears the website may address some of the issues.  If there was full application by those who are caught in this circumstance, the Minister's budget of &euro;230 million would need to increase.</p><p>  The Minister stated there was no such intention at present but I presume that, in line with all budgetary decisions, during the coming month her Department will be looking at all areas of social welfare and social protection payments.  Given the poverty that exists in this area I encourage the Minister to look at the thresholds to ensure that more people could qualify.  It concerns not only those who are marginally better off in work - some people are actually worse off working but would still prefer to avail of opportunities to work in the hope that work will pay in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900023#W00800"><p>My view, which I have given to the Deputy on a number of occasions, is that people are always better off in work.  They may start back on a relatively low income but very often, having worked for a period, they get increases.  It is better for those people and their families that they should work.</p><p>  The Deputy is right to state that the number of people interested in family income supplement at present is climbing.  I hope the improvements in the website contribute to that.  If one goes back to 2007, before the collapse, there were 37,000 people receiving FIS.   By the end of 2011 there were 51,000 and the figure is on the increase.  We have already received a significant number of new applications and applications for renewal to date this year.  </p><p>  Why is the scheme not better known?  To the end of April this year we had received 7,500 new applications and 10,700 renewal applications.  These are strong figures and indicate that further increase is likely by the end of this year.  I suspect FIS is not better known because for those people who work with large employers there tends to be a knowledge within HR departments.  Perhaps with smaller employers people may be reluctant to give details of their personal circumstances to their employers or those employers may be reluctant to take part in the scheme.  The Department has set up an employer relations division to go out and knock on employers' doors and talk to them about the fantastic people who are on the live register.  I have spoken at several meetings with employers, perhaps 2,500 since last October, when we started this very intensive process.  In early July we are launching Jobs Plus, an employers further assistance in terms of PRSI.  One of the points I will bring to the attention of employers is the availability of this very important assistance to families on low income, in particular those with children.</p></speech>

If its proposals, which relate to child income supports etc., went ahead the families who are in receipt of FIS would be much worse off.</p><p>I understand the families in receipt of FIS would be much worse off because the thresholds for the second tier of child benefit mean they would lose part of their child benefits.

Although the group's report is often referred to solely in the context of child benefit, it actually considered all payments made to families with children.  The total amount paid in benefits is almost &euro;3 billion, of which child benefit is &euro;2 billion.  One of the reasons the group is considering in-work supports is precisely to find out why more people do not avail of them and whether changes can be introduced to make it easier for both employee and employer to make use of the scheme.</p><p>  In regard to advertising, the Department's website has received approximately 6 million hits since its revamp.  We intend to place information on the FIS scheme on the website's revolving banner in order to draw attention to it.  I agree with the Deputy that it is an excellent scheme which offers a significant boost in income for families with children.  It is well known to a significant number of public service employees, such as those who work on a part-time basis in the HSE, but in other workplaces it does not seem to attract the number of applications one would expect.</p></speech>

Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assist with the necessary work required to initiate HAP including the completion of the economic assessment.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has advised that it plans to carry out a detailed business planning exercise which will further inform the Government as to the level of resources required.

I understand local authorities around the country have different levels of accumulated arrears from various types of tenants.  This is an issue for local authorities.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is interested in having my Department introduce a provision to deduct rents at source on behalf of local authorities but that would require considerable modification of our IT systems.  I am open to the suggestion but, given that 66 separate differential rent schemes and at least the same number of IT systems are in place, the introduction of a deduction scheme via social welfare benefits would require significant streamlining in the way rents are charged.  That is a major project but the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is currently preparing a business case for it.</p></speech>

We are determined to ensure the most vulnerable are enabled to benefit from economic recovery through activation programmes and services and, ultimately, being able to return to work.  The existing strategy for addressing poverty is the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, or NAP inclusion for short.  A key element of this plan is the setting of a national social target for poverty reduction.  This target, which was revised by the Government following a comprehensive review in 2012, is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and 2% or less by 2020.  In this regard, the Department recently published the social inclusion monitor which reports on progress towards achieving the national social target for poverty reduction. </p><p>  Also of importance was that the data highlighted that social transfers continued to perform strongly in 2011 in reducing the at risk of poverty rate by 24 percentage points from 40% to 16%.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of Irish social welfare payment levels of 60%.  While the figure decreased slightly on the 2010 figure of 62%, it is far in excess of the European Union norm of 35%.  In terms of the key targets, in 2011 the consistent poverty rate was 6.9% which, according to the Central Statistics Office, &quot;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&quot;.</p><p>  One of my priorities is to target policies and resources at the groups which carry the greatest burden and risk of poverty, namely, jobless households and children.  This is reflected in the commitment to set sub-targets for these groups.</p></reply>

Food poverty has been defined by <i>safe</i>food Ireland as not being able to afford a meat or vegetarian equivalent meal every other day, being unable to afford a weekly roast dinner or vegetarian equivalent at least once a week or missing a meal in the previous fortnight owing to money reasons.  According to the most recent figures available to <i>safe</i>food, one in ten people was experiencing food poverty in 2010.  This is a stark statistic in a so-called wealthy country.</p><p>  The Labour Party, of which the Minister is a member, published a policy document on food poverty in 2009-10 in which it estimated that one in five people was experiencing food poverty.  All of us are aware that the position has deteriorated markedly since 2010, as shown by the quadrupling of the number of calls made to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has the findings of studies carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions and others which showed that almost 50% of the population must borrow money to pay basic bills.  I expect the figure of one in ten will have increased significantly.  Is the Government concerned about food poverty and does it have any specific proposals to address this aspect of poverty?</p></speech>

The social inclusion division of my Department performs a role similar to that performed by the former agency.  I have asked the division, which has great expertise in measuring poverty and examining what constitutes being less well-off, to examine this issue.  I am pleased Deputy O'Dea acknowledged that I and my party are highly concerned about poverty.</p><p>  Food poverty is one element of the poverty experience and has been defined as the inability to have an adequate and nutritious diet for reasons of affordability or accessibility.  The emphasis on the issue of nutrition is critical as it raises the need for education on the use of food, diet and so forth.  Households experiencing food poverty consume less nutritionally balanced diets and suffer from higher rates of diet related chronic diseases. </p><p>  Sometimes people associate food poverty with a lack of food or low incomes when in many cases it is caused by the absence of a nutritious diet.  While this may be related to income, it may also be because people do not have sufficient skills or knowledge in the area of nutritious food.  We have a number of programmes in place for this reason.  I am pleased to note that, notwithstanding the tight budgetary position in 2013, my Department spent &euro;35 million last year on school meals, notably on the development of breakfast clubs and hot school meals.  I prioritised this budget and increased it this year by &euro;2 million to provide nutritious hot food to children as they start their school day.  This is a positive social development in our education system. </p></speech>

I referred to the document produced by the Labour Party prior to the general election which states that current Government policy does not address the issue of food poverty.  Given that there has not been any change in policy, I must presume the current Government's policy is not addressing the issue either.  The Labour Party document contained a number of specific proposals, including the introduction of a nutrition strategy for everybody in Ireland; measures to nutrition proof all relevant Government policies; extending the provision of free meals of a nutritional standard to every primary and secondary school child; and the introduction of a food and health action plan.  Which of these proposals have been implemented in the past two and a half years?</p></speech>

As I also indicated, the social inclusion division of my Department has been leading the development of policy in this area at my request as a Labour Party Minister.

As such, a solution requires a multisectoral approach across all relevant Departments.  Food poverty is not an isolated issue that results in poor dietary intake but one aspect of wider social exclusion, which takes into account factors such as income, education and knowledge about nutrition.  Some people spend a relatively large proportion of their income on poor quality food.  All schools encourage children to bring nutritious packed lunches to school.  I am supporting the school meals initiative, which provides hot food, and the programme is expanding at this time of great economic difficulty and pressure on budgets.  I am delighted to be in a position to support it. </p></speech>

The scheme has made very significant progress since it came into operation in July 2011, with 17,609 internship placements having commenced to date.  There are currently 6,104 participants on the scheme and 2,218 vacancies available on the JobBridge website.  The independent evaluation conducted by Indecon economic consultants, which I published recently, found that 61% of interns who complete placements secure employment within five months.  These progression outcomes are exceptionally positive and compare very favourably with European averages in this area.  The report does not state that 240 of the 7,300 companies surveyed are availing of the JobBridge scheme to displace paid jobs.  The number of companies surveyed was 3,021 and the report finds that displacement only occurs in only a very small number of cases &ndash; just 3% of the overall number of placements within the organisations responding to the survey.</p><p>  The Department takes breaches of the JobBridge scheme very seriously, and 17 companies have been disqualified from participating in the scheme due to breaches of the terms and conditions relating to it.  This action was taken by the Department following detailed investigations.  While 17 companies have been disqualified, more than 7,500 host organisations have commenced internships and, therefore, the overwhelming majority of companies are abiding by the terms and conditions of the scheme.  To protect interns and ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme, a variety of control measures and criteria are in place.  These are designed to ensure an internship does not displace an existing position, that it provides appropriate training and development experience and that suitable mentoring and support is given to the intern.</p><p>  To ensure both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the rules of the scheme, we monitor progress on an ongoing basis.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both interns and host organisations.  We have carried out in excess of 2,000 monitoring visits to date and 98% of these have been of a satisfactory nature.  Where non-compliance is discovered, remedial action is taken.</p></reply>

Only one in five secured employment with the companies with which they did their internships.  Of course, a large number of people did not complete their internships in the first instance.  Indecon's survey reveals that 3% of the 7,300 companies involved in the scheme admitted they were displacing workers.  It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that in the region of 220 - which is a quite considerable number - are abusing the scheme.  There are probably many more firms which do not admit to doing so.</p><p>  Is the Minister aware that the extension of the scheme to small enterprises in the craft and design sector has people talking about free labour being available?  I received a communication from an honest jeweller who wants to take on a worker on a part-time basis at &euro;10 per hour and who states that proceeding with an internship in this regard would be a complete lie because the job involves low-skilled manufacturing work which can be learned in a week.  I am of the view that large numbers of interns are going to be taken on in this sector and this will create huge problems for honest employers.  In addition, those taken on as interns in the sector are going to be abused.  This will happen on the Minister's watch.</p></speech>

Those who employ people often inform me that they never previously appreciated the sheer calibre and quality of many individuals who, unfortunately, are currently without employment.  JobBridge is designed to give such individuals an opportunity to obtain work experience which will allow them to get onto the ladder of employment.  If the Deputy has read the Indecon report, he will know that one of the reasons people leave JobBridge is because in many instances they work for a relatively short period of their internships in their host organisations and are then offered further employment.  Many firms have identified the calibre of the people on internships and have taken them on as a result.  Approximately 40% of internships are with public or publicly funded organisations.  As a result of the embargo on recruitment, it is not possible for many of those organisations to take people on.  However, such is the calibre, experience and quality of many of those on internships, they tend to move on - as the Indecon report shows - to further employment.  This is due to the fact that they have either developed networks or are in contact with people who recognise that they are individuals of skill and talent who merit being employed by firms with vacancies.  JobBridge has been a very positive experience for many people.</p></speech>

Furthermore, 29% of the employers surveyed said that, even if they had not taken on interns, it was highly or fairly likely that they would have taken on employees in any event.  I put it to the Minister that what is needed is not trickery with figures to massage the tragic situation relating to unemployment but rather real measures and investment aimed at creating jobs.  The Minister made a name for herself three weeks ago when she declared that austerity has reached its limits.  However, she has done nothing practical or concrete in the context of putting the consequences of that conclusion into effect.  An hour and a half ago, she voted to cut the salaries and alter the working conditions of low and middle income workers and take more money out of the domestic economy.  I put it to her, therefore, that legitimate measures relating to and real investment in emergency job creation in the areas of infrastructure and services are required, not this excuse for a scheme, in order to dent the massively high unemployment figures in a genuine way.</p></speech>

I am a practical person and during my entire time in politics, what I have been interested in is young people.  I worked for a long period in third level education and I am of the view that it is terrible to see wonderfully qualified young people from Donegal to Dublin to Cork emerging from college into a very tight jobs market.  These individuals have qualifications but they do not have work experience.  Internships are meant to allow them to obtain such experience.  I am aware that the Deputy has grave difficulties with this concept but in other countries where it operates extremely well, it allows people to obtain a degree of experience in order that they might subsequently find work.  People are doing so across all job and placement schemes.  In the context of community employment, of which I believe the Deputy is on record as being broadly in favour, one must always be very careful with regard to the issue of displacement.</p><p>  Indecon is an independent consultancy company which, I understand, attracts very strong and positive recommendations.  It carried out a survey and interviewed people in real time at my request.  I did not want to wait five years to discover the position.  I wanted to be able to give people such as the Deputy, who are obviously thoughtful about schemes of this nature, the actual figures involved.  Those figures are not mine, they are those presented by independent consultants.  I suggest that they offer food for thought as to how we can assist people in their 20s and 30s who have emerged from college and who cannot find jobs in this particularly tight employment market.</p></speech>

Departmental medical assessors are not involved in reviewing illness benefit claims at claim stage, as a claim has already been certified by the customer's doctor.  Customers may subsequently ask to attend for medical assessment by a departmental medical assessor for a second opinion as to whether the customer is incapable of work.  The opinion of the medical assessor following this assessment is submitted to a deciding officer for consideration regarding the customer's continued entitlement to illness benefit.  Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the Department may have that decision referred to a social welfare appeals officer for determination.  All assessments carried out by the Department's medical assessors are made in accordance with evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols and conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Medical Council.</p><p>It is difficult to distinguish on a statistical basis between physical and mental health incapacities in respect of illness benefit.  Illness benefit claims as recorded on the Department's IT system hold a single &quot;certified cause of incapacity&quot;, as reported by the person's doctor.  This is the primary condition that is initially diagnosed by the primary health care provider.  However, a significant number of patients may have associated conditions and it may be the latter that render the person incapable of work on an ongoing basis.</p><p>It is not the case that the Department is using medical reviews to reduce the number of people in receipt of illness benefit.  I have set out a statistical table below that shows the number of medical examinations carried out in the past three years and the percentage of recipients found capable of work.

This question was submitted following discussions with a number of Deputies.  People with mental health difficulties seem to be disproportionately affected, given the increase in the number of clients presenting at our constituency offices.  The question should probably have asked about the disability allowance as well.  Will the Minister ask her Department to examine this issue in order to determine whether there is a trend and, if so, rectify it?</p></speech>

That is the job of his or her doctor.  When someone applies for illness benefit, he or she has received a doctor's certificate.  It may be that a person has a number of conditions including physical and mental health elements, but it is whatever the doctor certifies as being the primary illness from which the person suffers that appears on the certificate.</p><p>  I do not have available statistics on physical versus mental health diagnoses.  I will ascertain whether that type of information is available in the Department, but it would not tend to be, as the doctor is the one who describes the condition.  A significant number of people with mental health issues are in receipt of social welfare income support.</p></speech>

I have also encountered this issue.  The perception - it may only be a perception - seems to be that someone with a mental illness is not taken as seriously as someone with a physical and, therefore, visible illness and, as such, a different approach is taken.  Given where we are as a society and the considerable increase in rates of depression and mental illness, I hope that the word will go out from the Minister and the D&aacute;il that there can be no differentiation at any stage.  This could help to address the perception.</p></speech>

Currently, 22 medical assessors, including the chief and deputy chief medical advisers, conduct medical assessments across a wide range of the Department's schemes, including illness benefit.  Of these assessors, six have postgraduate qualifications in the mental health field, for example, the MRCPsych and the diploma in clinical psychiatry.  They also have extensive clinical training and experience in psychiatry as well as membership of recognised professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  The medical assessors have an ongoing commitment to continuing medical education so as to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced.  They work in a collegiate way.</p><p>  As result of a recent recruitment campaign for medical assessors, seven were recruited, of whom two have mental health qualifications, for example, the MRCPsych.  The further recruitment of medical assessors is under way.</p></speech>

It integrates the employment services and community programmes formerly provided by F&Aacute;S, the community welfare services formerly provided by the HSE and the income support services provided by the Department.  The Department recognises the advantage of contracting with external service providers.  This provides access to additional expertise and knowledge and complements the Department's own services by bringing in extra resources to meet increasing demands.</p><p>  As part of the Department's employment service provision, it contracts with external providers for the delivery of the local employment service, LES, and job clubs' employment services, including career planning and job search assistance, to clients who are activated through these services.  The Department funds this service provision to the tune of some &euro;25 million per annum.  The Department also has contracts, worth approximately &euro;18 million, for the delivery of income support and related services across a network of more than 60 branch offices that complements the Department's office network.</p><p>  In addition, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion to provide expert advice and assistance with the design and delivery of a commercial model for the contracted provision of employment services.  A report was recently provided to the Department and is being evaluated.  Any decision regarding the question of engaging commercial private contractors to deliver employment services will be a matter for the Government and any subsequent process of engagement with private providers will be undertaken in accordance with normal public procurement procedures.</p></reply>

The Minister will recall how, when the Pathways to Work scheme was announced, a specific commitment was made to consider the possibility of using private contractors.</p><p>The Minister said the matter has been passed to a committee to evaluate the possibility and that it will report in due course.  Does she have any idea when she will be in a position to make a definite call on the issue?</p><p> I have a document which is currently being prepared by the local employment service, LES, co-ordinators for the Government.  Having set out some of the shortcomings in the system which would hinder or cause difficulties to the introduction in full of the Pathways to Work scheme, the document states:<blockquote>Initially there was a belief that these shortfalls could be met through &#8220;contracting with the private sector...in areas such as case management...employer engagement, job activation of long-term unemployed and job-matching/placement.&#8221;  However, the High Level Issues analysis by the DSP [Department of Social Protection] has since accepted that [it quotes directly from the Department] &#8220;this process will take time and considerable resources to develop and the scale of the task that confronts the Department should not be underestimated.&#8221;</blockquote>Could the Minister comment on the fact that her Department has found that private contractors are more or less shying away from the possibility of involvement because they have taken the view that it would not be financially worth their while to get involved because the last tranche of payment on the scheme proposed is only made when someone has been placed in a job.  The private contractors consider that is too difficult in the current climate.  Jobs are so scarce that it is impossible to place people.</p></speech>

I invite Members, including committee members, to visit some of the new Intreo offices because they are such a change in how people experience a social welfare office.  We are also taking people&rsquo;s photographs when they sign on as jobseekers for the new public services card and electronic signing has commenced.  Following that, jobseekers are involved in a case structure system involving group interviews and then personalised interviews to see how we can help them.</p><p>  The local employment service, LES, joined the Department consequent upon the F&Aacute;S employment services joining the Department.  I consider it a valuable resource, as does the senior management of the Department, given that it is experienced in helping people back on what is sometimes a long road of education in some cases, going on to employment or developing their own business and self employment.</p><p>  I am most anxious to continue to develop the models.  I am not aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the profitability of private sector providers in the UK.  We are examining the methods in various European countries.  I have spoken to people in Sweden, for example, about their public employment services and I am also interested in the French model.  I have read also about the UK model.  We also have a tradition in this country of using privately contracted-out local social welfare offices.  There is a long history of contracting out in this country.  It is one that has worked successfully and has assisted and provided services for many communities.</p></speech>

Her engagement on this scheme ceased in 2004.  Recruitment of new participants or re-engagement of former participants to the JI scheme has been closed since November 2002 and, accordingly, it is not possible to reinstate her as a JI participant.  In 2004 she was working in the context of services provided by F&Aacute;S.  From 2004 she was directly employed by the organisations which acted as the sponsor to the JI scheme.  Her role was to provide administrative support.  This support was normally provided by JI supervisors, but where there was a need for additional administration sponsors could be allowed to pay for this function by employing a person directly or contracting the administration to an external source.  The funding for the post of the person concerned came from the JI scheme administration and materials grant.  This was reviewed in February 2012 and the Department advised the sponsors that the grant aid for the scheme's administration and training grant would continue until the completion of the then contract on 1 June 2012 and that it would cease thereafter.</p><p>  All contracts for schemes are appraised on an annual basis and any contract and the terms contained therein only have a maximum duration of one year, which is subject to the availability of appropriate funding.  Furthermore, in 2012, following a review of all employment projects, projects saw a reduction in the level of grant aid allocated in 2012 as funding was allocated according to the needs of the participants and the project circumstances.  The need for funding any additional administration duties has diminished for the most part, due to the decrease in participants on individual JI schemes.</p><p>  Following the review, the current scheme contract commencing on 1 June 2012 was given approval for 49 workers, supported by funding for two full-time supervisors.  These ratios are in keeping with the recommended ratio of supervisors to workers, which also includes the provision of administration.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Therefore, it is not possible to provide funding for additional administrative support which was the role carried out by the person concerned.  Any matters relating to contracts of employment for those employed by organisations grant aided by the Department, should be addressed to the registered employer.</p></reply>

She has confirmation in writing from one of the then directors of F&Aacute;S that she would have her terms and conditions guaranteed.  She has asked via the centre that the Department would engage with the Labour Court on the matter but it has refused.  In addition, she asked if she could be re-engaged on the JI scheme.

As the Deputy appreciates, the case has a long history, going back to 2001 and 2004 when the Department of Social Protection was not involved in the area.  As the Deputy said, the person concerned was originally a participant on a JI scheme.  The scheme ceased in 2004 and the company closed.  As the Deputy indicated, responsibility for the JI scheme transferred to another company.  It also transferred the employment arrangement of the person concerned.  Funding for the post of the person concerned came from the JI scheme administration and materials grant and I presume the problem arose because the scheme closed and the grant is diminishing.  An agreement was reached on 49 people and two supervisors, which is the appropriate relationship.  I will ask the officials in the Department about the issue.

It is delivering on the programme for Government commitment to set up a co-ordinated employment and entitlements service and involves a multi-annual programme of complex legislative, organisation, process, people and work changes running to the end of 2014.  There are five strands to the pathways approach, namely, engagement with people who are unemployed, the provision of  activation places and opportunities, incentivising the take-up of opportunities, working with employers and reforming institutions.  A key component of the strategy is to increase engagement with employers and to incentivise them to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed and are on the live register.  A dedicated employer engagement unit was established in 2012 to co-ordinate the Department&rsquo;s engagement with employers.</p><p>  Experience shows employers are often reluctant to take on people who have a gap on their curricula vitae and this reluctance must be overcome if a pathway back to employment for unemployed people is to be offered.  It is for this reason that I am particularly concerned to involve employers and to get their input into the pathways programme.  I personally have hosted nine employer roadshow events at locations all over the country, which were attended by more than 2,000 people.  In addition, the Department has hosted three job fairs and five breakfast briefings, as well as numerous briefings to industry representative groups and a significant number of meetings with individual employers.  Moreover, this engagement is paying dividends, both in respect of the success of the JobBridge scheme to which reference was made earlier and in the use of the Department&rsquo;s services by many small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and by large firms such as PayPal, Meteor and Eishtec, based in Waterford, as well as by public sector bodies such as the Passport Office to recruit people from the live register into direct employment.  This is because as vacancies arise, it is absolutely critical that those who are on the live register must be put in a position in which they can go for such vacancies.  If one considers those who are on the live register as having been parked to one side and if employers do not look on them as being a key resource of this country, which this country has trained and educated, one will not get people who currently are unemployed back to work.</p><p>  Thus far, with the new system we had 68,600 people in group engagements last year, while more than 40,000 people have benefited from such engagements this year.  The Department conducted 158,000 one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Significantly, under the Intreo model being rolled out, the process of engagement starts immediately.  This is because I want the motto to be that the first day one signs on to be a jobseeker also is the first day on which the Department helps the person who has become a jobseeker to get back into work.</p></reply>

Is the Minister still confident she will be able to roll out the scheme fully within two years of the initial announcement?  Second, what percentage of people who present actually are profiled?  Is it true, as I read recently in a newspaper report, that only a very small percentage of people who present have been profiled?  Is it true that profiling is confined to new entrants?  How much retraining and reskilling has taken place?  Finally, both the Taoiseach and the Minister have stated the Government objective was that this scheme would take 75,000 people out of the ranks of the long-term unemployed by the end of next year.  How realistic is that objective?</p></speech>

I personally have visited most of them.  Another 63 offices are to be rolled out by the end of 2014.  I must confess to Deputy O'Dea that I must rely on the good offices of the Office of Public Works, because it is acting as the Department's agents in this conversion and at times, there are problems with IT lines, way-leaves and so on.  Consequently, it is a highly exhaustive process.</p><p>  In respect of the roll-out of the cards, I certainly invite the Deputy to get his personal services card and, yes, the Department started with new jobseekers because new people coming in have their photograph taken to a biometric standard.  I understand the current figure has exceeded the 150,000 mark.  Later this year, the Department hopes to bring the roll-out to, for instance, retired people and those in receipt of pensions.  We intend to co-operate with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with regard to passports, although many pensioners seek to have a fresh photograph used for their personal services card.  It also will contain data regarding free travel, as the personal services card is capable of holding a lot of data.</p><p>  As for the targets in respect of activating people, I will provide the Deputy with a small example.  The Passport Office was recruiting temporary employees some time ago and all 52 of the temporary vacancies were recruited from the live register.  Eishtec in Waterford is expanding quite rapidly and our offices have been of enormous assistance to that firm in assisting people who have been unemployed in that region to apply for jobs.  I am happy to note that quite a number of people have been successful.  Similarly, companies such as PayPal have been involved.  As the Deputy is aware, it is establishing more than 1,000 welcome jobs in Dundalk and again, the Department has been offering the company all its facilities and resources to assist in considering both the people coming out of college and those who already are working in the IT sector and the people on the live register who would make great employees.  I hope this level of co-operation with companies will expand and develop, as it is the best way to get back to work as many people as possible who currently are unemployed.</p></speech>

It is appalling that the most vulnerable citizens were subject to the type of treatment, neglect, bullying, harassment and downright punishment imposed that occurred in a couple of those cr&egrave;ches and which was shown on "Prime Time" last night.</p><p> I want this issue to be put at the top of the Minister's agenda.  I understand three of those cr&egrave;ches are located in the constituency I represent.  I am appalled to think that the children were so treated and that their parents have been put under the stress of being misled in terms of what was supposed to be a cr&egrave;che that looked after these children.</p><p> The Minister should understand that it is not good enough to refer to the HSE inspection report which stated that 75% of child care facilities were in breach of regulations last year.  Seventy-five per cent of what?  Half the cr&egrave;ches breached regulations on adult-child ratios and staff background checks.  That is not good enough.  Sine 40% failed to provide a safe environment for children.  That is unacceptable.  One of the cr&egrave;ches received over &euro;1 million from the State last year.  That is appalling.  I want a root and branch investigation to find out what went wrong.  I want to know the numbers of children in the cr&egrave;ches, the number of cr&egrave;ches in the country, the private ones in particular.  I believe they get notice about inspections, which they should not do because the others do not; they can arrive on the spot.</p></speech>

Parents in my constituency of Wicklow, and parents throughout the country, are upset, worried, disturbed and shocked at what they witnessed in last night's "Prime Time" programme into what the Minister correctly described this morning on national radio as incidents of emotional abuse in some cr&egrave;ches, including one in my county.  It is widely accepted that the Minister is a reforming Minister; that is widely acknowledged by all stakeholders.  In past years this country invested in bricks and mortar, but not in standards and quality.  That is what we now must do.</p><p>  I want to put a number of questions on the record of the House.  When will we see the publication of the much-needed Children First legislation?  Can parents currently access inspectors' reports into cr&egrave;ches?  When will these reports be available on-line similar to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reports?  Is the Minister planning on recruiting more inspectors?  Is she satisfied with the standards of inspectors?  Can she confirm if a Garda investigation is under way, and what is the status of that?  Will people who were involved in incidents face punishment?  What advice would the Minister give to parents in Wicklow and throughout the country who had to drop off their children at cr&egrave;ches this morning, will collect them this evening and are now worried sick after the incidents that &quot;Prime Time&quot; correctly exposed?</p></speech>

Last night, we saw further evidence of children being abused in Ireland.  We saw babies being thrown onto mattresses, babies being shouted at, babies blackmailed, babies being bullied and threatened.  We even saw a case where a baby was left in a room alone as punishment: punishment for a little baby.</p><p>  It is understood that up to 25% of staff do not have adequate qualifications or training in early child care services, and up to 50% of staff are not adequately supervised or do not have continuous professional development courses available to them.  I would be appreciative of the Minister's response on that.</p><p>  The Taoiseach said today that the Government's response to this issue would not involve the ticking of boxes.  Will the Minister give us her opinion and that of the Government on mandatory reporting of abuse?</p><p>  Last night, Professor Hayes stated that quality in child care depends on staff.  What new measures are needed to be put in place to ensure that the correct type of people are employed in early child care services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900030#DD00400"><p>Last night, people were shocked, horrified and traumatised having witnessed cruelty, emotional abuse, physical heavy-handedness, and a blatant abuse of parents' trust.  There was a clear failure to deliver professional care and high standards for children in early child care settings.  We cannot have a quality  service without a quality workforce.</p><p>  In terms of what needs to be done, the Health Service Executive must immediately establish a helpline for parents; provide additional inspectors where gaps currently exist; publicise inspection reports; and publish the two critical items of legislation.  </p><p>  This crisis provides the Minister with an opportunity to secure the much-needed additional resources from her Cabinet colleagues to ensure full implementation of S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the workforce development plan.</p><p>  I ask the Minister for a definite timeframe for the publication of the Children First guidelines and the setting up of the Child and Family Support Agency.  Can we have a timeframe for the implementation of the workforce development plan?  Will she consider the possibility of introducing CCTV cameras, where parents are agreeable?  Will she withdraw State funding for facilities found guilty of breaches and replace the model of inspection of compliance with a model focused on outcomes for our children?</p></speech>

I am sorry to say that in many of the decisions taken by the Minister's Government, that trend of undervaluing carers and carers' work has continued.  The programme clearly illustrated huge deficiencies in respect of not just the qualification of staff but the suitability of some staff in these cr&egrave;ches.  They include issues around regulation and inspection.  These issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency, and no State funding should go to any facility that is not properly inspected, regulated and with suitable and suitably qualified staff.</p><p>  The second issue that arose from last night's programme is one of child welfare.  As other speakers stated, what we witnessed was bullying and brutalisation of very young children.  When will the Children First guidelines be put on a statutory basis to oblige the responsible and professional people working in this sector to report any misconduct of this nature?</p><p>  Are the cr&egrave;ches that were exposed on last night's programme still open today?  Did they take children into their care today?  If the answer to that question is &quot;Yes&quot;, in the name of all goodness how could that be the case?</p></speech>

Child care places were seen as no more than a labour activation measure for women.  What is evident in the damning, distressing footage we saw last night is that nowhere in the provision of care were the needs of children being met.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to ensure, after the horrendous footage we saw last night in the cr&egrave;ches, that funding must be linked to quality.  I am not talking about infrastructure or access to the best, new and brightest toys.  I am talking about the warmth of the relationship between the care giver and the child because that is what counts.  That is what will achieve the best outcome and impact on the provision of child care for children.  It is not just a labour activation measure for women to return to work.  It is about the provision of quality, inclusive, holistic child care for our children.</p></speech>

It is near impossible, but what we witnessed on the video footage was a fundamental breach of trust in terms of the most vulnerable people in our society by those turning a profit.  The individuals responsible, and all child care professionals, should be in this area because it is a calling, they have a basic love of children, and they want to nurture and educate those children for the many hundreds of thousands of parents who are unable to do so for a short period every day.</p><p>  Qualification should be mandatory for every individual who works in a cr&egrave;che or child-minding facility, and those individuals should be thoroughly vetted and monitored on an ongoing basis because parents must have confidence in them.  Some Deputies mentioned the cr&egrave;ches still operating today.  Parents must have confidence in those facilities in terms of the care of their children.</p><p>If they cannot have that confidence, something is wrong with the system we oversee.  All of this must be related in some way to the ongoing funding of such facilities.  If we are funding them as a State, even though they are clearly in breach of the guidelines issued by the HSE, the funding must be stopped to ensure they adhere to those standards.</p></speech>

Parents with children in child care are extremely worried and they are looking to the D&aacute;il for assurance the practices seen on our screens last night cannot be tolerated.  Will the Minister give such an assurance today?  Strapping toddlers to chairs for hours on end, shouting in their faces, tossing them about like rag dolls, forcing them down on mattresses with blankets over their heads and locking them alone in rooms are appalling practices.</p><p>  A review and reform of regulations with legislative change is clearly necessary.  State funding for child care should be more closely tied to strict adherence to regulations.  I want to lay emphasis on that.  It is absolutely essential.  There must be a fundamental review of the policy of dependence on the private for-profit sector.  The training and pay of child care staff must also be addressed.</p><p>  I have questioned the Minister on these issues during the current D&aacute;il and she has spoken of new strategies, programmes and plans.  They are all very well but without funding commitments, they will be meaningless.  We are prepared to work on a cross-party basis to advance these issues, as we have demonstrated time after time.  The new child and family support agency will take a lead role but it must be properly funded and equipped to do so.  What can the Minister guarantee in the interim pending the establishment of the new agency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1178" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900031#EE00300"><p>We have always known the first five years are the most important in a person's life.  It is the time when the future emotional, social and educational well-being is laid down.  It is, however, the area that receives the least support and investment and for which there is the least political responsibility.  That has been the case with successive Governments and, unfortunately, it appears it is still the case.</p><p>  During the boom, the expansion of child care services was largely determined by the needs of the labour market.  It became a numbers game and the welfare and best interests of children were secondary.  The State can no longer afford to abdicate its responsibility in this area.  While I do not question the personal commitment of the Minister to this area, it is simply not good enough to say the new agency will take responsibility for all of this.  When will we ever see this new agency?</p><p>  Action is needed now and we cannot afford to delay this any further.  Four things must happen immediately: registration and not just notification should be mandatory, an inspection service must be provided in every county, all inspection reports must be put up online and State support must be conditional on meeting minimum standards in respect of ratios and qualifications.  Where they are not met, State funding must be withdrawn and the facilities closed.  We cannot afford to allow our children to be abused in the manner we saw last night any longer.  Action must be taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900031#EE00400"><p>I do not want this controversy to distract the Minister from her intention of providing a second year of free child care in the next budget.  We must examine the entire model, however, because effectively we are funding private companies to deliver a public service.  Does the Minister not think it is time for the Department of Education and Skills to have a central role in this to roll out the Aistear and the S&iacute;olta programmes?</p><p>  What we saw last night just would not happen in a primary school, as I know from being a primary school teacher and principal, because of the management structures that are in place.  The parents who send their children to these centres want to know what will happen to the centres their children have been in where the incidents took place.  Do they have a future and will they continue to receive State funding?  Most people in the House would question whether the State should be funding such companies.</p><p>  I do not want to wait for another RTE investigative programme to have a hidden camera in a direct provision centre in Ireland.  If we are outraged about this situation in child care provision, as we should be, there are direct provision centres in this country that are also abusing children.  We must not just look at the issues raised thanks to the RTE programme last night, but at the provision of State care for children across the State.</p></speech>

I worked as a secondary school teacher and if someone reported that a teacher had tied up a student or put a student into a room with a blanket over him, we would be gobsmacked.  We put up with this for long enough in our nursing homes but it is not acceptable and tolerated any longer.  It was never tolerated in our secondary and primary schools and it should never be tolerated in our preschools.  Can the Minister give an assurance there will be an increase in inspections, that unannounced inspections will be introduced and that any staff shortcomings will be addressed?  Will the Minister withdraw public funding from child care providers if they are found to be in breach of HSE regulations?  Public money should be withdrawn from cr&egrave;ches that fail the children in their care.  Regulations and standards must be enforced if they are to be taken seriously and the public have the right to be able to have faith in the system.</p><p>  The Minister said on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; today that inspection reports would be available online.  Will that be new inspection reports or will that include inspection reports form the past?</p><p>  This has been a watershed moment in our thinking on child care and early years education in Ireland.  We must focus less on the profits of companies and more on the educational and developmental needs of our children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900031#EE00600"><p>I thank colleagues from all sides of the House who raised this important topic, the care of our children under five years of age and the services they attend.  It is the first time we have had such a focused debate on this age group and that speaks for itself.</p><p>  Obviously, I regret what has precipitated this debate.  I agree with what my colleagues had to say about the scenes we all saw last night.  The images were harrowing, distressing, shocking and absolutely unacceptable.  We saw poor practice and the dereliction of duty and care resulting in the mistreatment of young children that bordered on abuse.  It was extremely distressing to watch.  I concur with the comments made.  It is striking that when our children begin in primary school at five years of age, the inspection regime, the curriculum, focus, teacher and mentor support are all in place to a much greater degree than is the case in this sector.  It has happened in other countries but it has not happened here and that is the task that faces us.  Those are the issues we must address.</p><p>  I will try to respond to as many comments as possible.  The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 are the basis on which the HSE carries out preschool inspections.  Clearly, the incidents shown last night would appear to constitute serious breaches of those very regulations.  We need stronger and more robust inspections which take account of quality to a far greater degree than the current regime and we need stronger sanctions.  I certainly concur with the points made on that.  If we take the current regulations, such as regulation 5 on the care and development of young children, and regulation 9 on managing the behaviour of young children in these centres, we can see they were not adhered to as intended.</p><p>That goes without saying.</p><p> As Members probably will be aware, the practices witnessed and the centres that were the subject of the programme are also the subject of a thorough and comprehensive investigation under way by both the Garda and the HSE.  All such instances of mistreatment of children in child-care settings should be reported to authorities.  It does not need statutory reporting.  That is essential and necessary under the current guidelines but, obviously, obligatory reporting strengthens that provision.  Clearly, under the current guidelines, any instances of abuse of children or instances bordering on abuse of children where there are concerns should be reported.</p><p> It should be noted that the children in last night's report appeared to be younger than the preschool cohort and in that programme there is no evidence of poor practice in relation to that cohort.  Last night's report would obviously make us extremely sensitive to examining and investigating continuously what precisely happens during the course of the early childhood care and education, ECCE scheme.</p><p> I alert Deputies to the fact that Pobal investigates the ECCE scheme on a yearly basis and we have an annual report since we began that only last year.  We now have a cohort of information about compliance across the sector.  There are some statistics I will share with Deputies.  The issue of qualifications has been raised a good deal.  For the first time ever, as I stated, last year we collected information on this cohort.  For example, the number of staff qualified at FETAC level has risen, from 70% in 2010 to 86.5% in 2012, and 86.5% of staff are now qualified up to level 5 in these settings.  That is important information.  We have demanded higher standards in training for the leaders in the ECCE programmes, and 98% of those have level 5 or above.  There is continuous improvement but there is no room for complacency.</p><p> Some Deputies raised the issue of mandatory qualifications.  For the new contracts and new regulations in September, I am examining increasing the level of qualification which ought to be in place for staff who are employed within the sector.</p><p> The matters addressed in last night's programme deserve and demand a comprehensive response.  We should discuss them at greater length on another occasion in order that we can comprehensively discuss the range of issues that have been raised on this occasion under the Topical Issues debate format.</p><p> Parents need to be reassured that their young children, whether in child care services, cr&egrave;che or wherever, are protected and cared for.  As a number of Deputies stated, there are many examples of high quality practice in this country.  We do not want to create panic in every parent in the country about the standard of services which are being provided for their children, but we need to be vigilant.  Parents themselves are vigilant.  Parents are not powerless in this situation.  As some Deputies suggested, we want to encourage parents.  What parents should do is go to their providers and ask questions if they are concerned.  They should ask to see inspection reports, which are available.  New inspection reports will be available online in a number of weeks.  On the inspection reports already done, there was a substantial piece of work in providing those as well.  Something we need to do which has not been done to date is to analyse all the reports.  We need to see the messages from the inspection reports from around the country.</p><p> The HSE has informed me that there will be a website available shortly outlining what prosecutions have taken place so that parents will have access to that information.  Today, I spoke to Mr. Gordon Jeyes about bringing the findings together and analysing them by sector - private sector, not-for-profit sector, community sector - to see what we can learn from the inspection reports that have been done.  Deputies will be surprised to hear that, like many issues in relation to children in this country, we did not have these national data.  We do not have a national approach to inspections.  I have asked Mr. Jeyes to ensure we adopt that national approach.  That will ensure inspection staff can be redeployed in a flexible manner to deal with some of the gaps, and a number of inspectors are being recruited.</p><p> There were quite a number of other issues raised which I will not have the opportunity to respond to right now, but perhaps I will have an opportunity when I respond after the Deputies have spoken.</p></speech>

That should be a priority.  The Minister should get that moving fast.  As Deputy Shortall stated, we want action, not words.  We also want immediate emergency teams to get into the cr&egrave;ches that failed on inspections and were in any way deficient.  The Minister should get qualified paediatric nurses in there to see that the standards of care are correct.  The Minister stated, for instance, that it bordered on abuse.  It did not border on abuse; it was abuse.  It was bullying.  One should call it what it is.</p></speech>

It is not the Minister's fault.  I am pleased that there is a thorough Garda investigation.  I would ask the Minister to give consideration to the use of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  HIQA is carrying out inspections of nursing homes.  It will start carrying out inspections in residential homes for persons with disabilities.  It is the independent regulator.  It merits consideration.</p><p>  We also need to look at the issues of childminding in the home.  This is the next issue that could come down the tracks if we do not.  It has been addressed in the North and in Scotland.  It merits consideration in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  It is about empowering parents.  The Minister is quite correct.  I very much welcome the fact these inspection reports will go online shortly.</p></speech>

I would like to have more time to spend discussing some of the finer points of the Minister's report, but in the time available I will confine myself to three points only.  One, I raised the issue of abuse and the Minister responded by stating that it bordered on abuse.  When children and babies are treated in the way they were treated as shown in the programme last night, I respectfully say that is not bordering on abuse.  There is clear evidence of abuse of children.  Two, in response to my question on mandatory reporting, the Minister stated that issues like this should be reported.  I have stated previously in this House, and I ask the Minister to take this to the Government, that it is my firm and honest opinion, especially after last night's programme, that we must have mandatory reporting on abuse.  Three, can the Minister tell us the number of service providers which receive State funding that have never been inspected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900032#FF01500"><p>Can the Minister ensure at the earliest possible opportunity that the Government will make adequate time available for a proper debate on this?  Can she confirm whether the HSE has established a helpline to deal with this and whether she will look at the possibility, with parental support, of installing CCTV in child care settings?  Can she give us a definitive timeframe for when the children first Bill and child and family support agency Bill will be before the House, and that the children first Bill will deal with childminders?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900032#FF01600"><p>I agree with the Minister that the last thing one would want to cause is widespread panic because my children, like those of many others, have had very positive experiences in cr&egrave;ches.</p><p>  I am gobsmacked at the fact that cr&egrave;ches which clearly have broken the current HSE guidelines and into which there is a Garda and a HSE investigation under way would still be open today.  If the Minister wants to give confidence to parents and to stem any panic, she must prove categorically that where abuses and breaches of regulations occur, even before she introduces the reforms of which she speaks, firm action will be taken.  Can she explain to us how, in light of all of this evidence, these cr&egrave;ches are still functioning?</p><p>  The issue of child care in the home was raised.  That is a significant point.  Why did the Minister cut the childminding advisory posts?  There were only a limited number of them across the State.  They offered a network, support and training for individuals who care for children in their own homes.  It was a bad decision and it might be one that comes back to haunt us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900033#GG00100"><p>We should not cause panic among parents and as a parent of a young child I understand how much we rely on child care.  I contacted my local cr&egrave;che this morning in Dungarvan just to say I was thinking of the workers there.  It has been a very difficult day for them, and these people are very committed to their job and giving care and attention to children on a daily basis.  Most in the House would probably agree with that statement.</p><p>  The Minister spoke about Pobal analysing the results of the community employment schemes around the country.  Anybody with experience of services funded by Pobal would say that its reports always focus on numbers but we must move away from them if we are to speak about quality child care provision.  It is not just about numbers, how many new pieces of equipment have been bought or how many children attended a service but rather what the child and the carer do in the service which has the biggest impact.  It is unfortunate that it took this investigation to bring the matter to the fore.  I am not sure the inspections as they stand would have outed the sort of poor practice we saw last night, which is really scary.  We must focus on that and I know the Minister is really committed to the area.  I hope to continue working with her to ensure we can bring improvements to fruition.</p></speech>

The point just made by Deputy Conway is true and it may be the case that inspections may not have picked up the problems we saw last night.  That is all the more reason for us to get the Children First Bill published, as it is crucial at this point.  Deputy Harris indicated we must empower parents so they can have confidence in the child care service providers they use and we must ensure that the response of the Minister, the Government and the House adequately provides such empowerment.</p><p>  With regard to enforcement of regulations, where a child care provider fails the HSE child care standards from 2006, it should be closed and funding should be stopped.  It is an occasion where the Minister needs a big stick because if something like this recurs, it would be disgraceful.</p></speech>

I bring to the Minister's attention that there are 35 child care positions advertised on the JobBridge website today.  These are internships so we must ask how appropriate these are.  I have no problem with such placements but they should be made in addition to full staffing levels and not instead of properly trained staff, as I suspect they are so often.</p></speech>

In the community sector the reality is the Government is cutting funding for child care facilities.  We are all familiar with the fact that so many of those facilities in our constituencies are struggling to survive and the funding arrangement makes little or no provision for management or supervision of those services, which are being cut to the bone.</p><p>  The Minister cannot get quality on the cheap and she should not expect parents to police these matters.  Parents have a right to expect that where facilities are being provided for our most vulnerable and where State funding is forthcoming, the State should be playing its part in ensuring that quality is there.  That is clearly not happening and action must be taken in the area.  The Government must take its responsibility seriously.</p></speech>

In her reply she indicated that none of the children depicted in last night's programme would have been in receipt of the free preschool year as they were too young.  If we are to convince the Irish people that we need a second free preschool year, we will have to deal with younger children and we must be able to ensure Irish people will have confidence in the system and that the second preschool year will be worthy of taxpayers' investment.</p><p>  I would like the Minister to respond to my question about direct provision centres as the issue is connected to how we deal with children under the care of private providers funded by the State and those funded directly by the State.  The Minister knows that direct provision centres are dealing with children who are not being adequately cared for.  We all know about this so we cannot let the opportunity go by without addressing that issue.  As others have said today, we need a fuller debate at an early stage to flesh out these issues in a more prolonged debate.</p></speech>

That is all we ask for.  We know the Minister has the commitment, as became clear with her response.  I am sure anybody listening shares my wish that when a child goes to a cr&egrave;che or any institution like a cr&egrave;che, the child's educational and developmental needs should be met.  Above all, they should be safe and cared for.</p></speech>

The question is whether a more robust inspection system would have found the problems instanced last night.  The international evidence is that if there is an inspection system which engages in a positive way with providers, working with them to improve standards and which collaborates over time, there is a higher chance that the kinds of scenes we saw last night would be avoided or uncovered through an inspection system.  Nevertheless, it would not be guaranteed, and there is a range of other issues that must be addressed in order to provide the safe environment about which Deputy Lyons has spoken.  That would encompass dealing with issues.</p><p>  A certain focus has not been evident historically, and there are large legacy issues in the area that we will not be able to address overnight.  Nevertheless, I should be clear that they will be addressed.  I have stated that what I saw last night was emotional abuse and there is no question about that, as children's developmental needs were ignored and responses were inappropriate in many instances.  There is a big job to be done.</p><p>  There are many excellent community cr&egrave;ches and child care services where parents are receiving a high quality service.  We also have good private facilities.  Nevertheless, we must have a robust inspection system and deal with the issues raised by many Deputies, including sanctions, compliance and consequences like prosecutions.  All those elements must be addressed.  At times, this may not be the way we want to go as we want to primarily provide a high-quality service but all the elements must be addressed.</p><p>  In April this year there was a total of 270 community child care schemes and every Deputy in the House knows about the quality in many of those community services.  There is still work to be done with qualifications and access-----</p></speech>

Last night's programme threw a sharp focus on the issues but there are initiatives under way at present.  I reassure Deputies and parents that these are working towards registering all child care facilities.  It is unbelievable that in this country we have allowed people to open child care facilities by simply notifying the HSE.  That cannot go on and it will stop.  It is the legacy and what we have allowed to happen in the sector.  The responsibility for that would encompass the approach to children in a very general way.</p></speech>

Unlike the previous Government, this Government will bring in mandatory reporting and has already had consultation. It was not done in 14 years despite promises by previous taoisigh.</p><p>  To answer the question on the child and family agency, in a few weeks we will have legislation in the House to establish the new child and family agency, which is the most radical reform the area of child protection and child care services has seen in decades.  This is under way at present.  The legislation will be in the House and will go to Government in a number of weeks.  This will mean we will have a dedicated focus for the first time on these issues with dedicated management throughout the system.  We have not had this in the HSE.  This dedicated focus will ensure we have higher standards and this is extremely important.</p><p>  A number of Deputies raised the question of child minding.  Every day parents take decisions and a total of 70% of children in the country are looked after by private childminders. This is the decision parents take.  They make decisions about the quality of this care and take the decision these childminders will mind their children.  There is no regulation in this area.  In other countries there is such regulation.  This is an issue which may well be on the agenda in the near future also.</p></speech>

A frequently asked questions document was sent with the legal agreement and one of the questions was with regard to what the letter was about.  The answer stated under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme in order to finalise - a very important word - compensation arrangements applicants must sign a legal agreement with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It also stated the letter included the legal agreement the person was being asked to sign, with the instruction to return both copies of the agreement to the Department within four months.</p><p>  One of the implications of signing this finalising legal agreement is that if the more than 700 families who wanted to be relocated, or signed up to be relocated under the compensation scheme, sign up they will be told that if an alternative bog is not found by 2017 in the case of the first bogs designated, or 2018 otherwise, then the Minister may move these people to another scheme.  This other scheme is financial compensation, something to which they did not sign up and something about which we warned them, but now their eyes have been firmly opened.</p><p>  Some people will say 2018 is a long way away and all of the relocation bogs will be organised by then.  Perhaps if we had a competent National Parks and Wildlife Service it would happen and perhaps if we had a Minister who would really work with turf cutters it might happen, but this is not what is happening.  As a result, since 1997 none of the 53 supposedly special area of conservation bogs has been successfully organised with regard to relocation for the turf cutters affected.  The idea that between now and 2018 something will happen all of a sudden and all of these people will be satisfied is barely credible to say the least.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association warned - I am bringing in its message; these are not my words but those I have been asked to bring in - that all the Government was trying to do was slowly but surely stop people cutting turf.  Now it transpires, and is quite clear, that the scheme was a halfway house to stop people cutting turf.</p><p>  Other concerns have been raised in this regard, one of which is whether it will put a burden on the land.  It will and there will be a cost to this.  Who will bear it?  It looks like it will be the turf cutter.  There is also an issue with regard to indemnity but we will return to this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900034#HH00800"><p>It is a condition of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme that applicants must sign a legal agreement with me as Minister.  These legal agreements are required under the scheme to give legal certainty to people regarding their long-term compensation.  It binds the State to deliver on the compensation they have been promised.  The signing of agreements also means the applicant undertakes to no longer cut turf on special areas of conservation.  The scheme sets out clearly the obligations placed on the recipients and on me as Minister.  As announced in the Dail debate in March last year, an additional once-off incentive payment of &euro;500 for qualifying cutters is being provided where agreements are signed with the Department.</p><p>  Under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, three types of legal agreements have been and are being issued by the Department.  There is an agreement for qualifying turf cutters who sign up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years.  There is also an interim relocation agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but where no relocation site is available for them.  This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.  There is also a final relocation agreement.  This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation and where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting.</p><p>  The legal agreements are modelled on those which have been agreed with groups of turf cutters from Clara Bog in County Offaly, and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway.  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to these sites will take time to finalise.  Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time.  If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues with regard to the purchase or lease of a site, the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at the time.</p><p>  All of the legal agreements clearly state that title to the property will not change.  The existing land ownership or turbary rights held by an applicant will not transfer to me as Minister by the signing of the agreement.  As the Deputy is aware from my reply to his question on 25 April last, relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity; the infrastructure, including drainage works, required; establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site; the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease; and possible planning and environmental impact assessment requirements.</p><p>  Of the 2,651 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme received and acknowledged by the Department, 781 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  In collaboration with the Peatlands Council and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, the Department is actively engaging with turf-cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed for these applicants.</p><p> It is my aim to facilitate, as far as possible, those qualifying cutters who wish to continue to cut turf by putting in place relocation sites for as many cutters as possible in the shortest possible time.  The interim agreements are designed to guarantee the delivery of compensation while relocation is being put in place.  The national SAC management plan may deliver additional flexibility where relocation is not possible.</p><p> The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association could assist this process, and the interests of the majority of cutters who are engaging with my Department, by working with me within the law, rather than encouraging people to work against all our efforts to resolve outstanding issues.</p><p> I appeal to the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association to return to the Peatlands Council and engage with the RPS consultants who are now undertaking the scientific work which is essential to underpin the national SAC management plan as well as the review of the national heritage area waste bog scheme.</p></speech>

Less than 18 months ago, the chairman of our organisation, Mr. Michael Fitzmaurice, was described in a telephone call by the Taoiseach as a patriot.  What has changed?  Was there something to be gained from calling him a patriot then, while now suggesting that the same people are working against the Government?  I do not really understand that.</p><p>  The Minister says the legal agreements are modelled on those which have been agreed with groups of turf cutters from Clara bog, Carrownagappul bog and Curraghlehanagh bog.  I am very familiar with what is going on there.  The Minister may well have come to an agreement with some turf cutters on Clara bog, but he has not come to an agreement with all of them.  In fact, the ones the Minister has not come to an agreement with are people who own large amounts of that bog.  Is it fair that they are being left out?</p><p>  The Minister referred to Carrownagappul bog which was held up as an example of one that was working.  It was said that if only we would all do what they were doing, the problem would be solved.  Deputy Paul Connaughton is connected with that bog.  If that bog is solved, why in the last month have people gone back to cut turf on it?  Last year, they did not do so because they believed that the Minister was trying to accommodate them.  Subsequently, they have discovered that the deal on offer is not like-for-like.  A 65 year licence is not the same thing as owning a bog.  If a licence-holder dies, it is non-transferable, which is not the same.  If the National Parks and Wildlife Service deemed that a person had cut very little turf, they would be out on their ear after a couple of years.</p><p>  There is a serious question to be answered here about indemnification of bog owners.  One of the major concerns expressed at the Peatlands Forum was the issue of flooding neighbouring lands and damaging livestock.  We were seeking indemnification for those people.  It seems that the Minister sorted out the indemnification for the State and to hell with the turf cutters, but we are not buying it.</p></speech>

I have met the RPS consultants on two occasions and I think there is a great opportunity here.  I really mean that.  I appeal to Deputy Flanagan and everybody else concerned to engage with the consultants.  I think that solutions can be found to some of the present issues, including those the Deputy has raised here in the House.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1020" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900035#JJ01300"><p>The importance of every citizen having a safe and secure home cannot be overstated.  Like the Acting Chairman, I am increasingly concerned about the critical shortage of social housing provision in the greater Dublin area and especially in my constituency.  Some weekends, up to two thirds of those who contact me are in desperate need of housing.  I am increasingly presented with difficult situations on the housing front.</p><p>  In recent months, the number of homeless people in the Dublin Bay North constituency has been increasing.  They are sleeping in cars, shopping centres or on the street.  The spring count of people sleeping rough in Dublin in April showed that 94 persons were sleeping on the streets of the capital.  That is the highest level since spring 2009, which shows that no progress has been made to reduce the number of people sleeping rough on our city streets.</p><p>  The Fingal county manager, Mr. David O'Connor, recently told us that about 9,000 individuals and families are on the Fingal housing list.  A recent meeting with the Dublin city manager, Mr. Philip Maguire, and Dublin City Council housing manager, Mr. Dick Brady, revealed shocking housing and homelessness figures for the Dublin Bay North constituency - which is housing area B of Dublin City - and for the whole of Dublin city.</p><p>  There are just under 20,000 individuals and families on the Dublin City Council housing list, with a further 7,217 on the city's transfer list.  In Dublin Bay North there are 5,152 families and individuals on the housing list and a further 1,124 on the transfer list.  Some 236 families and individuals are homeless in area B out of a total of 849 for the whole city.</p><p>  Many of the housing applicants I meet on the area B list have been on that list for between eight to 15 years.  In one case last year, the applicant had been on the list for 18 or 19 years.  While I accept the commitment of our officials, the policy response to these appalling figures by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council has been abysmal.</p><p>  In 2011, for example, just 115 housing units were allocated in area B of Dublin city with a further 149 units in 2012 and just 68 units so far this year.  If senior citizens' accommodation is excluded, the figures are just 67 units for 2011, 89 for 2012 and 45 so far this year.  When the crash occurred in September 2008, we had up to 2,000 vacant housing units on the north fringe of Dublin city and the south fringe of Fingal.  Over the last four or five years, however, many of those units have been occupied by investors with rent supplement tenants, by purchasers and voluntary housing agencies.</p><p>  Clearly, however, only a resumption of construction and direct housing provision can hope to address this appalling housing crisis in area B, which is in my constituency.  Some of those desperately searching for housing are constituents affected by cuts to rent supplement and the refusal of landlords to accept rent supplement.  Earlier today, I tried to raise the issue of caps on rent supplement payments with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, but unfortunately my oral question was not reached.</p><p>  Rent supplement, which was intended as a temporary measure, is increasingly being relied upon by individuals and families in the medium and longer term.  Reduced caps are forcing many constituents out of rented accommodation into temporary accommodation or, indeed, into homelessness.</p><p>In Fingal, for example, where the caps have been set at &euro;775 for a family with one child or &euro;900 for a family with three children, the total rent demanded for properties in some areas far exceeds those amounts.</p><p> The recent death of Margaret Thatcher reminded people that it was her governments which abandoned social housing provision and began relying on private rented accommodation and the very expensive Exchequer-funded rent supplement, and in the process enriched the landlord class, which funded and, indeed, owned the Tory Party.  From the late 1980s the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael led Governments, also very close to the landlord class, embarked on the same socially regressive policies in this country with a Government policy of abandoning capital investment in housing and a move to increasingly relying on the rental market.  It is not working and the glaring failure of this can be seen in our constituency.</p><p> I see the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, beside the Minister for Social Protection.  It has been mooted in the media in recent days that at least &euro;1 billion or up to &euro;2.5 billion might be available for construction projects to boost employment.  I have been consistently referring to the need for this Government to kick-start a capital investment programme for social housing and I have repeatedly raised this with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business.  Before Christmas he told me this would happen in 2013, but 2013 is becoming a stand-still year for the economy.</p></speech>

It is a critical issue for me as well as for Deputy Broughan and I strongly support the issue of construction whenever we have the funds to do it.  I realise it is a particular problem in Dublin.  This morning I met  Dublin City Council assistant manager, Mr. Dick Brady, whom Deputy Broughan mentioned, and his officials regarding homelessness.  The Dublin area gets approximately 70% of the money available for homelessness in the country.  It is approximately &euro;30 million again this year and it was similar last year.  We will continue to work with them to address that issue.</p><p>  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, reaffirms our focus on meeting the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support from within the resources available.  Our social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  We are tailoring the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and exploring the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  Delivery is being significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but we are also developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.</p><p>  Traditional models of large-scale local authority social housing construction are not feasible in the current economic circumstances, which is why the housing policy statement recognises that the approved housing body sector must play a key role in addressing social housing need.  The Government is committed to exploring and developing such funding mechanisms as will increase the supply of new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build-to-lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</p><p>  In this regard, I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more Revenue-funded options presents challenges.  I am therefore developing an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.  My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse.  This code, which I hope to launch in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of approved housing bodies, AHBs.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the widened range of schemes to facilitate social housing delivery, and the innovative approach being adopted, will enable us to maximize the delivery of social housing within the very burdensome current financial constraints.  As soon as those constraints are beginning to lift we will review the construction area.  The importance of a housing sector built on the pillars of choice, fairness and equity across tenures is central to the approach being taken by this Government to the housing sector.  Providing local authorities and approved housing bodies with a suite of options that can be tailored to meet different categories of housing need is central to this Government's policy approach.  We have to respond to the need that is there in whatever flexible ways we can to provide homes for people who need them.</p></speech>

We do have to respond to those who telephone us to say they are walking the streets or they are in hostel-type accommodation where they are very unhappy or frightened.  It is a terrible situation in which to place citizens.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny and I had a great predecessor as Deputy in our constituency - Conor Cruise O'Brien.  In his political philosophy, one of his key arguments was that if one has executive power in government one is responsible for everything that happen in that area.  This House is responsible for everybody who is homeless or in difficult housing situations tonight, and we must live up to those responsibilities.</p><p>  In the context of preparations for the budget, which under the two pack arrangement is very early this year, is the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan pitching to the Minister beside her, Deputy Howlin, who I am sure is totally aware of this situation in County Wexford as well, for a serious new housing programme under whatever model the Government decides to proceed with?  What kind of hope can she give to us?  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny, knows inside out that in the second half of this year we have almost no prospects in Area B or in the Dublin Bay North constituency of receiving significant additional housing for 5,000 people.  This is an emergency, it is a crisis.  We have to try to address it.  Has the Minister of State been speaking with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton?  Unfortunately I did not manage to have the question of the problem with rent supplement debated on the floor of the House today.  We are trying to address the vicious circle or catch-22 situation where family members are unable to work and are being placed in a situation where, to some extent, they are being used to put pressure on landlords and rental price levels, which is very unfair to them.</p><p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the voluntary sector.  I look forward to her bringing in the two housing Bills, which was mentioned yesterday, and the voluntary code.  However 2015 or 2016 is too late for many of the people of the kind who the Acting Chairman and I represent.  We need some kind of dynamic programme to be launched later this year, to be up and running and to deliver results on the ground.  We have seen how in the UK the increasing use of emergency hostel or hotel type accommodation places major burdens on local authorities and the state.  We are heading in the same direction.  It is related to the first item that was debated here today, the private provision of pre-school facilities.  Perhaps the private sector is making huge profits from a situation which should not exist.</p></speech>

I am not here to answer for her.  We intend to transfer that clientele to the local authorities in the near future.  I recently launched a housing-led policy on homelessness.  All the research shows that if we can get people into homes as soon as possible rather than hostels for long periods of time that is a much more effective way of addressing their homelessness and of giving them a long-term sustainable and caring solution. We are working on that.  We are going to spend less money on hostels and crisis intervention and more money on resettlement and support.  That is the direction of the housing-led policy I have launched.</p><p>  I am very hopeful that we are making good progress on homelessness including in the Dublin area where the predominant problem of homelessness is.  This is a very important issue and I am glad Deputy Broughan raised it today.  We are sourcing as much social housing as we can through NAMA.</p><p>We want to use whatever mechanisms we can use at present.  Whenever some capital becomes available we intend to construct more local authority houses.</p></speech>

The Deputy behind mentioned that 24 of his 25 amendments were ruled out of order as, I suspect, were the majority of the 71 tabled amendments.  It would be helpful to us if, through the Office of the Ceann Comhairle, a list could be presented to us of the amendments that are in order.  Looking at the schedule in my hand, I have no concept of what is in or out of order.  The information is in the House in the pink packets in front of certain people.  It would be helpful for us to have the list.  The Ceann Comhairle might not be able to supply this now but it should be the practice for future legislation to give Members such a list.  There is a grouping schedule for discussion purposes.  There should be a list of amendments that are ruled in order so that we can know what is ahead of us for the next few hours.  I make that point for future reference, if it cannot be done today.</p></speech>

Some 52 of the 71 amendments tabled have been ruled out of order and the other 19 can be discussed.  Perhaps the Standing Orders of the House might be changed in order that, in addition to grouping schedules, lists of amendments that are deemed to be in or out of order will be circulated to Members as a matter of course.</p><p>  Section 1 of the Bill contains several references to previous legislation relating to financial emergency measures in the public interest.  I am of the view that the section should also have contained a confirmation that there continues to be a financial emergency in the country.  One could argue that a financial emergency was in existence when the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 - by means of which serious pay cuts were imposed - the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 were all introduced.  In 2010, we were obliged, for example, to borrow money from the troika of the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF.  We are almost ready to emerge from the troika process and the IMF is scheduled to leave our shores in December.  As already stated, the section refers to the titles of several items of legislation relating to financial emergency measures in the public interest.</p><p>Will the Minister explain his assertion that there is a financial emergency in the country?  There is still a deficit, but &quot;deficit&quot; is not the definition of &quot;financial emergency&quot;.  The deficit is being reduced year on year and we are meeting all of our EU-IMF targets.  Today, various reports were published on many EU countries.  Spain has a deficit of 7% while Belgium and others have much larger deficits, yet they do not consider themselves to be in financial emergencies.</p><p> We are dealing with financial emergency legislation at the end of May 2013.  Notwithstanding the need to reduce public expenditure and our deficit, it is incumbent on the Minister to clarify whether a report that is available to the House has confirmed that we are in a financial emergency.  The Acts referred to in section 1 - the previous financial emergency measure enactments - require an annual report to confirm the existence of a financial emergency.  Such a report was issued in 2010 and 2011.  The last report I saw was in June 2012.  Perhaps as soon as next week, the Minister will have an up-to-date report on the financial emergency.  It would have been better to have had the published report before the completion of this legislation.  There is no reason not to delay Report and Final Stages for one week.  With the report, we and the public would then be in a position to judge whether there was a financial emergency.</p><p> In the context of this debate, some of the recent legislation resulted from the referendum on cutting judges' pay.  This was done on constitutional grounds rather than on grounds of a financial emergency.  The reasoning was that judges should not have been exempted from reductions in public sector pay.  A cut was deemed to be proportionate and the people of Ireland voted accordingly.</p><p> Before the Minister proceeds with section 1, will he explain, including in writing, why he is convinced that we are still in a financial emergency?  It should not be the usual reference to the need to cut the deficit and to reduce expenditure.  At the conclusion of Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, spoke on the Minister's behalf.  He stated:<blockquote>Deputy Fleming also asked for the Government's estimate of when the financial emergency would end.  I cannot, unfortunately, guarantee that the crisis will end on a particular day or in a particular month.</blockquote>While I accept this and the situation depends on growth in the international economy and other factors, the Minister should be able to outline the circumstances in which financial emergency measures will no longer be necessary.</p><p> This legislation is concerned with pay and pension cuts over a three-year period or longer.  Why are we passing legislation for three years' time when we might not even be in a financial emergency?  Who adjudicates on whether the emergency still exists?  Is it the troika, the Minister, the Government, the Houses or the fiscal council?  By definition, none of the legislative measures in question should continue to exist once we are out of the financial emergency.  Will the Minister clarify why he views this Bill as necessary?</p></speech>

I thank the Acting Chairman.</p><p>  I proposed an amendment proposing an alternative Long Title.  Sadly and like many other amendments, mine was ruled out of order.  In the midst of this financial emergency, it sought to highlight the need to address the considerable pay inequity within the public service.  Were the Minister serious about crafting legislation in the context of a financial emergency, this would be the first issue addressed.  He has not done so.  He is still going further down the payscale to seek cuts that he claims are necessary and in the public interest.</p><p>  No public servant or trade union activist who has followed this debate believes that it is in the public interest to visit more hardship or cuts on low and middle income workers in the public service.  The CPSU, which represents clerical workers within the service, has come out strongly against the Haddington Road agreement accompanying-----</p></speech>

I would wager that there is not a clerical officer within the service who believes that visiting more hardship on that group by freezing increments, seeking an effective pay cut - an increase in working hours amounts to this - and increasing the expense of the child care services for which many of them must pay can be considered to be in the public interest.  It is a pity that the Minister fails to see this.</p><p>  I proposed an amendment on the definition of increments because incremental payments should not be touched, including a freeze.  As the Minister well knows, incremental payments are of most significance to those earning lower wages.  For example, the Secretary General in the Minister's Department has no worries about incremental scales, given the fact that it is a one-point payscale.  It filters across the system.</p></speech>

Clearly, it is not.  If the Minister had full confidence in the deal as set out by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the trade union leaderships, he would not introduce legislation at this time or in this manner.  He has had form throughout the process.  From the Croke Park debacle to Haddington Road, his form has been to wave a big stick at unions and their members and to be shrill, badgering, hectoring and threatening.  This legislation, which would allow the Minister extraordinary powers to freeze increments, cut pay and extend working hours, is just the latest in a long sequence of that bullying approach.</p><p>  I am sorry that my amendment on the Long Title was ruled out of order.  Deputy Sean Fleming and others have pointed out that a significant number of the amendments that we proposed in good faith have been ruled out of order.  This raises an issue for the D&aacute;il in terms of the decisions made on what is allowed.  Given the importance of this legislation, it is farcical that the majority of our amendments have been ruled out of order.</p><p>  The Minister and I have different views of what might be in the public interest.</p><p>It seems to me that he seems to think it is a good plan to have policies that are targeted at low and middle income workers and their families that have, as a consequence, a contractional effect on the domestic economy and high levels of unemployment and emigration.  I differ with the Minister in that regard.  Public sector workers in large number also disagree with him.

It makes an extraordinary joke of democracy that out of 71 amendments, more than 50 are ruled out of order on a Bill that has such profound effects on hundreds of thousands of families in this country, their quality of life, pay and conditions, and that debate on such issues is short-circuited in this way.</p></speech>

If one's amendments have an impact on the Bill, they are out of order, and if the amendments do not have an impact on the Bill they are out of order.  Pretty much everything is out of order if one disagrees with the Government.</p><p>  Particular amendments were ruled out of order on the grounds that they were &quot;declaratory&quot; - whatever that means - because they factually sought to rename the Bill as the &quot;Financial Emergency Measures in the Banks' Interest&quot; rather than the current name referring to &quot;the Public Interest&quot;.  It seems to me that one can justify what is in the Bill in many ways but the one thing one cannot do is claim it is in the public interest.  Even the Minister, at times of slightly greater honesty in dealing with this current crisis, has said when pushed that he does not like doing this to people and that he would rather not have to do it to them.  I suppose when he says that, it is a begrudging admission that what he is doing is not fair, just or good for the public or the workers on whom he is imposing the changes.  He tells us he is doing it because he has to because the policy to which he has agreed and that is being pushed on us by the ECB and the troika is that the first step on the road to so-called economic stability is to protect the banks.  They say we must get the banks and the financial system up and running before we can do anything else.  At least it would be honest to say that is the purpose of the Bill, that it is a Bill to shore up the banks yet again and to ask public sector workers to pay for it, but one cannot even make an amendment to the name of the Bill even though it is a factually accurate description of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill was published last Thursday and amendments had to be tabled within 24 hours.  A total of 51 amendments have been ruled out of order, many of them for no good reason.  The manner in which the Bill is being rammed through the House with a guillotine is an affront to democracy.  Deputy Joe Higgins can speak for himself.  He tabled an amendment seeking that the Bill be renamed as the "Reduction of Public Servants&rsquo; Pay, Pensions and Conditions Act 2013" and it is difficult to understand how it was ruled out of order.  However, the Bill specifies that it is to provide for "the reduction of the remuneration of certain public servants ... (B) the reduction of the amount of the payment of pension ... and (C) the alteration of the operation of scales of pay for public servants (including the suspension of the awarding, for a certain period, of increments under those scales)".  That is exactly what Deputy Higgins specified in his amendment.  The amendment relates to what is in the Bill and has been ruled out of order for no good reason.  That shows the anti-democratic manner in which the Bill is being pushed through this House today.</p><p>  The wording in section 1 refers to &quot;financial emergency measures&quot; on a number of occasions.

Moreover, as I indicated, private-sector workers also will lose their jobs.  A recent report by the Nevin Economic Research Institute showed that taking &euro;1 billion out of the economy through this measure will save at most &euro;250 million but will put 10,000 people on the dole queues, including 5,000 private sector workers, as well as public sector workers.  As a Labour Party Minister, surely Deputy Howlin agrees the very rich and wealthy, that is, those who earn huge salaries per annum or who have huge assets are those who should be made to pay.  I remind the Minister that during the last general election, he and his Labour Party members and candidates went around the country telling everyone they would protect the vulnerable.  This measure certainly does not constitute protecting the vulnerable.  This is an attack on the grassroots Labour membership in this country.  It is an attack on labour history and is an attack on the 1913 Lock-out strikers, who won freedom of association for people in this country.</p></speech>

While I will not make the point ad nauseam, I wish to put on record that the length of time given to debate such substantial legislation is profoundly inadequate.  I often have heard the Minister, in his previous capacities, speak of the need for reform and for more open and transparent debate.  While he may not admit it today, he must be aware the level of debate is not sufficient in the House today.</p></speech>

It refers to targets in respect of Ireland's budget deficit agreed with the European Union and the troika.  However, this does not in any way justify the need to take &euro;300 million out of workers' pockets while clear alternatives are available.  It is premature to bring the Bill into the House today.  Trade unionists are being placed in an impossible and invidious position, many of whom will vote &quot;Yes&quot; to the agreement for understandable reasons, because this Bill, if passed, would make their conditions worse.  A sword of Damocles is being placed over their heads but were they to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to the agreement, that somehow would be presented as agreement with the economic strategy.  However, I do not believe this in any way accurately reflects their view.  If Members wish to deal with the deficit, which I accept, and if they wish to bridge the gap between what is taken in and what is given out, which I believe must be done, then the way to do this is through progressive taxation measures.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to make the point for other measures or other forms of legislation, rather than the contents of this Bill, which provides for pay cuts and an increment freeze, which have no justification and are in no way progressive.  Moreover, no one should suggest in this debate that this legislation is socially progressive or that Ireland will be more and not less equal on foot of this Bill's passage.  If Members are being honest with themselves, they must know it will not and that the solution is fair and balanced progressive taxation.</p><p>  With respect, I ask the Minister to do one or two things and out of respect to the Chair, I will conclude on this point.  First, the Minister should allow more time for the debate.  He is aware that the D&aacute;il is not even sitting next week.

He wanted me to define whether there is still an emergency in order to justify the Bill.  In the Bill I amalgamate the requirements - this will be the fifth financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, item of legislation - to bring a report to the House to identify that the conditions that justify the maintenance of what are extraordinary measures still exist, that is, that we need these measures to contribute to the recovery path of our economy, to put our fiscal base in order and to ensure we have sustainable finances.  That will be done on an annual basis, as is normal.  Instead of individual ones for each Bill, if this legislation is enacted there will be one comprehensive report, and it will be a matter for the House to debate, if that is what Members want, in terms of whether the emergency continues.  I deliberately chose to put these measures in FEMPI legislation rather than in an ordinary piece of legislation because I recognise that FEMPI Acts are not normal, they are required to contribute to the financial emergency we are experiencing, and they are not permanent for that reason.  They need to be unwound at some time when the economic circumstances of the State allow it.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald spoke about pay inequality.  There is one pay cut in this Bill, and that is for people earning in excess of &euro;65,000.  That is 13% of the public service.  Some 87% of the public service earn less than that, and there is no cut to their core pay in this set of proposals.  That is the reality.  </p><p>  I have debated this many times with Deputy McDonald and her general contention is that we should have a flat ceiling of &euro;100,000 in the public sector, and that nobody should be paid more than that.  She never explains whether that should scale down or whether there should be any differentials at the top - the old trade union principles of differentials.  However, even that principle has been breached in the amendments she has tabled to this Bill because she is determined that, uniquely, hospital consultants should be paid &euro;150,000, not &euro;100,000.  We are now moving into a different realm because it has finally dawned on Deputy McDonald that the flat blanket ceiling of &euro;100,000 would destroy our health services for a start, as I explained several times.  I am not sure that it would not have the same impact on the Judiciary and everything else.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald spoke about crafting the legislation.  That is a good word because this legislation is crafted to reflect what is a brokered deal that we now call the Haddington Road agreement.  That has taken place after five months of engagement with all trade unions that came to the table, and all eventually did.</p></speech>

The genesis of this is simple.  One of the parting gifts this Government was left when we came in to a broken economy by the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Administration was a profile of expenditure, including many expenditure reductions, but even on top of all the outlined expenditure reductions was a further hole of what they called unallocated savings.  We have to address those unallocated savings and in order to get to the 3% deficit by 2015, which we are obliged to do, we must make further adjustments of &euro;3 billion, and 36% of expenditure comes from pay and pensions.  I recommended to Government, and the Government was of the view, that it was reasonable to ask for a proportionate contribution rather than go back to front-line expenditure on welfare, health care, the disability sector or education again.  That is what we set out to broker on an agreed basis as far as was possible with the trade union movement and, by and large, the movement understood that because all of us, public and private sector, have a vested interest in the recovery of our country so that we can have a way forward that is sustainable and public services of which we can all be proud.</p><p>  The Deputy makes a point about increments.  The point would have been stronger, if she will forgive me saying it, if she had said that some increments should be protected.  She did not do that.  The negotiated settlement under the Haddington Road agreement will protect increments for all workers who engage in the process.</p><p>  On Deputy McDonald's point about the protection of collective agreements, collective agreements are vindicated by that.  The engagement of trade unions on behalf of their members is fully vindicated, not only in this legislation but by the Haddington Road agreement.</p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Healy both made strong presentations on amendments that are ruled out, and I thank the Chair for making the position crystal clear.  The Minister and the Department has no hand, act or part in determining what is and is not in order.  That is entirely an administrative decision made by the officials of this House and, ultimately, by the Ceann Comhaire and the Ceann Comhairle's office.  I thank the Acting Chairman for making that abundantly clear.</p></speech>

There are a number of amendments to the section but this amendment is not grouped for discussion.  It deals with the reference to annual remuneration.  I have asked for it to be included so there is no doubt that overtime payments will in no way be included in any future definition of the annual remuneration of a public servant.  At the moment in the Bill annual remuneration deals with basic salary together with fixed periodic allowances that are reckonable for pension.  It is possible in some situations, particularly with reduced staff numbers, that overtime will be fixed and periodic, with a set pattern in many jobs.  Prison officers often tell me they have no choice about working overtime, that it is fundamental to their fixed period of work and their periodic allowances, is paid periodically and included as part of their annual remuneration.  I envisage with the changes in numbers in the public service, and the redeployment and changes that will happen, it could easily arise in many situations that overtime is compulsory and necessary for the proper management of front line and other services.  Those who work overtime want to be sure this definition of annual remuneration, which will be cut depending on the level of income, and we will discuss the details of that in subsequent amendments, will not include overtime payments under the section for any pay cuts that might be introduced in future.</p></speech>

I am happy to confirm a reference to remuneration for the purposes of the pay reduction being applied here is a reference to basic salary and fixed periodic allowances only.  Overtime is neither basic salary nor a fixed periodic allowance and therefore already excluded from the definition of remuneration.</p><p>  I should have explained what a fixed periodic allowance is.  It is an allowance which is of a fixed amount, taxable and pensionable, and not reliant on the type of work of the amount of work performed, such as at weekends.  For example, a principal's allowance or a Minister's allowance on top of a Deputy's pay, which most of us would regard as core pay, are included but those are all that is included, no overtime rates will be or are included in this definition.</p></speech>

If this ever goes for adjudication, the remarks on the record of the House will be used to buttress the point and the concern I was raising.  My main concern is that because of the changes in the public service and the nature of pay, overtime could become fixed in some circumstances down the road.  I will take the Minister's assurance based on the FEMPI legislation here today and based on the fact that emergency will not last forever and that it might not be too long.</p></speech>

It was linked to amendments that sought to remove the Minister's intention to further cut the salaries of those under &euro;100,000 per year.  It was part of a package where instead of attacking those who earn less than &euro;100,000 per year, the Minister would impose whatever cuts he is seeking on those earning over &euro;100,000 because they can afford it.  That is a principle many have articulated inside and outside of this House because they believe a Government that is interested in the welfare of ordinary working people, low and middle income families, should uphold that principle.  It should protect those on low and middle incomes and impose the burden of adjustment on those who can afford it.  I do not see why this Government resists such a way to deal with the adjustment it claims is necessary.</p><p>  The advantage of this is that it means low and middle income workers, who have already been hammered with the universal social charge, cuts in their pay and levies, and who are at the edge of being able to manage, would not have to suffer further.  It would also benefit the wider economy.  As many on this side of the House have said to the Government, as the trade union movement has said time and again, and as many mainstream economists have said, if we take money out of the pockets of low and middle income earners, we adversely affect the wider economy.  If we take it off those on higher earnings, because they can afford it, it will not have such a damaging effect on spending and, therefore, on the economy.</p><p>  The Minister always resists that logic.  I can understand Fine Gael doing that because traditionally it is a party that protects the well off and the super wealthy but it is astonishing that a Labour Minister and the Labour Party component of this Government resist this sort of alternative approach to dealing with the country's financial crisis.  I do not see why the Minister would oppose such amendments or the principle that lies behind them.</p><p>  Amendment No. 23 operates on the same principle, shifting the burden from those earning less than &euro;100,000 to those earning more than &euro;100,000.</p><p>It is connected to a wider set of alternative policies that have been articulated, not only by those in People Before Profit and United Left, but by the trade union movement itself.  The trade union movement has stated we need to move in this alternative direction, and well the Minister knows it.  If the Minister were on the other side of the House, as he was a few years ago, this is precisely the argument he would have been making and, indeed, Labour Deputies made it.</p><p> It is astonishing that sections of the trade union movement have signed up to what the Minister is proposing in this Bill because it runs counter to everything they have said for the past number of years when criticising austerity and talking about the economic damage that austerity is doing, both to the economy and to ordinary low and middle-income workers.  They say that and then they recommend that their members accept what is clearly cruelly unjust and economically counterproductive.</p><p> These amendments point to the alternative.  The Minister knows the alternative and I do not understand why the Labour Party is not supporting that alternative.</p></speech>

It is the same principle.  Essentially, I want to amend the table on page 6 of the Bill along the general lines about which Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke and my amendment reflects that.  My amendments, amendments Nos. 21 and 24, are part of this group for discussion purposes.  The principle is the same, that those at higher levels should pay more.  I mentioned it on Second Stage.  On the specifics of my amendment, the table to which I refer proposes a reduction in remuneration of public servants earning more than &euro;65,000 stating there should be a 9% reduction for those earning any amount over &euro;150,000 but not over &euro;185,000, and I suggest that the latter figure be increased to &euro;200,000.</p><p>  My next amendment deals with the next line in that table.  It, essentially, states that any amount over &euro;200,000 should have a 20% reduction.  That is the essence of where my amendment is coming from on that last line of the table.</p><p>  The Minister has capped the reduction for those on &euro;185,000 at 10%.  I picked the figure of &euro;200,000 for a higher cap, based approximately on the Taoiseach's salary.  With the passage of this legislation, perhaps his salary will be closer to &euro;185,000 but it is in the order of &euro;200,000.  I believe that anybody in the public service who earns over &euro;200,000 and is paid more than the Taoiseach should have a larger deduction than what is proposed.  There is a 10% deduction proposed and I propose an additional 10% reduction.  It is modest for those affected and I would urge the Minister to implement this.</p><p>  In the case of a hospital consultant on &euro;250,000, for instance, on the &euro;50,000 of earnings between the &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 bracket I propose an extra 10% over and above what the Minister proposes.  That 10% of that additional &euro;50,000 would only be &euro;5,000 gross and less than &euro;2,500 net, which is not a great deal.  It is only &euro;200 a month.  I am sure some of the consultants would not even get a night out on that.</p><p>  My amendments relate to anybody being paid more than the Taoiseach in the public service.  I have not stated there should be a pay ceiling, at &euro;200,000, at the Taoiseach's rate.  I recognise that many consultants earn over &euro;200,000.  For those on figures of up to &euro;250,000, on the amount more than the Taoiseach's salary they should pay an extra 20% as opposed to the extra 10% being proposed by the Minister.  The Taoiseach, as the head of the country, is a reasonable benchmark to take.</p><p>  I repeat that there is no prospect of any of these consultants heading over the Border, or to England or Germany, for the figures I propose.  For the extra &euro;50,000, it will only amount to an extra &euro;5,000 gross, which is less than &euro;2,500 net.  Nobody who is on a salary of &euro;250,000 will leave the country because of a net reduction of 1% of gross salary.  They will only lose &euro;2,500.  It is a modest proposal, but the Minister would be sending out a good signal that those earning more than the Taoiseach's salary should take a higher cut than what is being proposed.  My point is straightforward.</p><p>  I do not know whether the Minister is of a mind to accept any of the proposals here.  It would be good for a debate such as this in the House if, somewhere along the line, a Minister was willing to accept an amendment.  There is nothing wrong with this amendment.  Nobody, if on the salary of &euro;250,000 to start with, will leave the country for the loss of &euro;2,500.</p></speech>

The wealthiest 5% in this country have personal assets of &euro;239 billion.  The richest 300 persons in this country have increased their wealth significantly, by &euro;5 billion over the past two years.  What I have stated about the very wealthy persons of this country was borne out in this Chamber last week by the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, who told us that Ireland is the seventh richest country in the world.

Would he care to enlighten us as to which of those increments should be rightly protected?  In that remark, he seemed to concede the point.</p><p>  All of my amendments in this section were ruled out of order because they would constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  The thrust of them was, as others have said, to bring the primary focus for efficiencies and savings where I believe they rightly belong, that is, among the cohort of those who earn in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Minister is correct in stating that we have argued the idea of an emergency pay cap across the public and civil service.  He was not really in favour of that.  It seemed not to appeal to him.  He seemed to be more comfortable going after clerical grades than those further up the chain.  Given that he will not entertain the notion of an emergency pay cap, he might have availed of this emergency legislation as a mechanism to deal with those 6,000 persons in the public and civil service who earn in excess of &euro;100,000.  What I proposed in my amendments would not constitute an emergency pay cap which the Minister has set his face against but would propose a mechanism by which, finally and clearly, he could address the issue of the glaring pay inequity among those 6,000 workers within the system who earn far in excess of the &euro;65,000, which, the Minister states, is a handsome salary and represents only 13% in the system.  Those who are in a far more privileged position represent a smaller proportion of the service.  Some of them are not only paid handsome; they are overpaid.  By any international benchmarks, they are simply overpaid just as staff at the lower echelons of the civil and public service are in many instances underpaid.</p></speech>

Section 2 is the crux of the disagreement with the legislation.  The argument is that only salaries over &euro;65,000 are being touched, as they are on the higher end of the salary scale.  That may be so but there is a principle of equality and this only has an impact on workers in the public sector.  The fairer approach would use our pay as you earn, PAYE, tax system to tax people based on earnings, regardless of who is the employer.  That would generate the savings required, as answers to parliamentary questions provided by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, indicated last week.  A tax increase on incomes over &euro;80,000 up to &euro;125,000 and from a &euro;125,000 upwards would provide those savings.  That is why I disagree with the Minister and this legislation.  The PAYE tax system, instead of pay cuts, is the way to make those on higher incomes contribute more.  As a result, I support the amendments and ask the Minister to engage with the point constructively.  Progressive PAYE taxation is the way to go instead of pay cuts that will only have an impact of one section of the employment group in our country.</p></speech>

In essence, this set of amendments seeks to alter the threshold and accompanying rates of the pay reduction to be impose on higher paid public servants.  I know there is an anomaly as amendments seeking decreases were ruled out of order because they would be a charge on the State but the amendments seeking increases are in order.  That is what we are debating and we will consider it in the round.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about the impact on low and middle income public servants.  I repeat again that the pay cut will have an impact on those earning in excess of &euro;65,000.</p></speech>

They indicate that the average private sector wage in the State is &euro;32,670.  The threshold for the pay cut I propose is hence double the average private sector wage.  As I have stated privately to Deputy Boyd Barrett, it is getting harder to get into the working class under his definition.</p><p>  The &euro;100,000 threshold proposed by those opposite would obviously yield very little money.  We priced Deputy Boyd Barrett's group of amendments and they would reduce the quantum of money we would get by 60%, so they would not make the savings we require to bridge the gap.  They would fall very onerously on some groups of public servants, and Deputy McDonald is correct in mentioning hospital consultants in that regard, as well as the Judiciary.</p><p>  I have given very careful consideration to Deputy Fleming's amendment because there may be an idea that there is merit in going higher on the very highest earners.  It does not get much money, as the Deputy recognises.  The Government has indicated its intention to reduce the pay of higher-paid public servants as part of the measures we have set out to get &euro;300 million in reductions in pay and pensions this year.  I know Fianna F&aacute;il sought &euro;350 million in reductions in its pre-budget submission.  These reductions form part of the measures needed to meet our requirements in all our international agreements to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP, as we cannot keep borrowing and piling up debt for the next generation.  The reductions in pay set out were formulated to protect the basic pay of not only lower but middle income public servants, as acknowledged in the discussions we had.  We are looking to employ a progressive reduction based on earning bands greater than &euro;65,000.</p><p>  The reductions proposed in the Bill are also in line with the set of proposals brokered by the Labour Relations Commission and set out in the Haddington Road agreement.  With regard to the imposition of a significant increase in the reduction in pay to be applied to those earning in excess of &euro;200,000 - Deputy Fleming calls for the rate to be increased from 10% to 20% - I do not consider it proportionate or equitable to target that narrow group in the architecture of this legislation.  I have given very careful consideration to the matter.  I have taken legal advice on these matters.</p><p>  This is a judgment call and the reality is that the enactment of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill and retirement of a number of senior public officeholders has already resulted in a significant reduction in the public servant pay.  People speak about gross terms and they may not be aware of the following figures.  I will put on the record the impact of what we have done as a Government with regard to officeholders.  People had to think long and hard about this.  In 2009, the previous Taoiseach, former Deputy Cowen, earned &euro;285,583.</p></speech>

She keeps harping on about high pay so we should hear what are the reductions.  At the height of the last Administration in 2009, a Minister earned &euro;245,325, but after these reductions a Minister will be paid &euro;171,000, or &euro;155,000 before tax and after the pension-related deduction.  That percentage decrease for Ministers is 36% and other than the unfortunate people who lost their jobs, there are very few people who have suffered such a decrease.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p>  I know there are some people who believe we should not pay anybody but I was reared in a trade union household and I believe in differentials.  A Cabinet Minister should be paid more than somebody who does not have such responsibility, such as an ordinary Deputy, and a principal officer should be paid more than a junior administrator.</p><p>Likewise, a hospital consultant should be paid more than a junior hospital doctor.  These differentials must be preserved in some manner.  I say this so the record will be clear.</p><p> Deputy McDonald raised the issue of higher pay and I have dealt with this.  It is a movable feast.  We have move to a threshold for one unique group of hospital consultants whom Deputy McDonald believes should perhaps earn &euro;150,000.  Perhaps she thinks the same about judges, I do not know.  Perhaps all that judges should earn is &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

I believe they tried this in Albania.  These are matters we should honestly debate but we should do so in a way which is realistic.</p><p>  I want to be honest about Deputy Fleming's proposal.  I am concerned about the impact it would have.  I have given the reductions in pay which have already been taken by the Administration, that is not only by senior politicians but also by senior public administrators such as Secretaries General.  They all now earn well below &euro;200,000.  The only people other than consultants about whom we have spoken are the members of the Judiciary.  Deputy Fleming is aware we had a referendum to allow us reduce the pay of judges.  It is very difficult, given the separation of powers, to ensure judges are completely independent, and we made it crystal clear in the debate on the amendment to the Constitution that pay cuts had to be proportionate.  Article 35.5.3&deg; allows for reductions in judicial salary only in set circumstances.  It must be a proportionate, and not an exemplary, reduction.  This is the issue which crystallised my view not to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Fleming.  I understand and, as the Deputy might be aware, am not averse to the principle of it, but I genuinely believe it would be unwise, unfair and unwelcome to apply this marginal rate to a discrete cohort of people with regard to whom we sought the people's permission to alter the Constitution to be able to give them a proportionate reduction and not a disproportionate one.  This would be a very dangerous place to walk into.  I hope Deputies understand therefore that I will not accept the amendments.</p></speech>

Will the Minister put it on the record?  The pensioners were not represented in the Haddington Road agreement and have not had an opportunity to be involved.  With regard to the &euro;32,500 threshold, is it with regard to individual pensions or an accumulation of pensions, such as a Deputy's pension and a Minister's pension going over the &euro;32,500 threshold?  What happens with regard to a superannuation pension where a spouse also has a superannuation pension and would be entitled to a widow's pension?  What happens if one has a superannuation pension and a State contributory pension which puts one over the threshold?  These questions need clarity and I do not believe we will get to the relevant section to deal with it.  I hope the Minister will put the answers on the record.</p></speech>

What else could we do given the time available?  It is interesting that it was not a bad shot in the dark considering, because the Minister stated if he agreed to these amendments they would gather &euro;400 million, that is 40% of the adjustment, and shift the adjustment from those earning less than &euro;100,000 to those earning more than &euro;100,000.  It would still leave those earning more than &euro;100,000 very well off.  I do not think they will have trouble paying their bills, but it would do a great deal to alleviate the burden the Minister is imposing on people earning less than &euro;100,000.</p><p>  To respond to the Minister's suggestion and quip that our definition of the working class makes it very hard to be in the working class, let me point out, although I am sure the Minister knows, that many people who earn between &euro;65,000 and &euro;100,000 are in single income large families with nobody else working.  They incur many costs such as mortgages.  If one happens to be in a single income family earning between &euro;65,000 and &euro;100,000 it does not make one wealthy.  Many people in this bracket are having extreme trouble paying their mortgages and bills and educating their children.  This is not to say that if we had believed adjustments over recent years were necessary people earning more than &euro;65,000 should not have had to bear some of them, but this group has already taken a hammering with the universal social charge and the levies.  The reason we strike a ceiling at &euro;100,000 in these amendments, and seek to shift the burden to people earning more than &euro;100,000, is because we can be absolutely certain people earning more than &euro;100,000 can afford it.  This is the point.  If we want to then parse a little more the people earning less than this we can examine it, but the point is once people earn more than &euro;100,000 we know they can afford it.</p><p>  As has been pointed out by Deputy Nulty and many of us on this side of the House, we see this attempt to shift the burden as part of a wider package of putting forward an alternative to unfair, unjust and, we believe, economically counter-productive austerity.  It would also involve the tax system which, as has been stated, is a fair and progressive way to deal with collecting revenue for the State which does not discriminate.  There should not be discrimination between the public and private sectors.  The Minister's quoting of the CSO figures, if he does not mind me saying so, plays a little bit into demonising the public sector and setting it against the private sector by stating private sector wages averages only &euro;32,000 but public sector wages are higher.  This is not the definition or the line which should be drawn.  The line which should be drawn is between low and middle income people who are genuinely struggling to pay their mortgages and bills and those who can afford to do so.</p><p>  As Deputy Healy and others stated, these proposals form a suite of alternative and more progressive ways to gather revenue for the State which would also include wealth taxes and increased corporation taxes.  Even in the narrow remit of this legislation why would the Minister not accept an amendment?  If he could even bother to listen perhaps he would explain to us why it would not be fair to shift &euro;400 million of the adjustment he wants to impose on people earning less than &euro;100,000?  He stated it was 40%.</p></speech>

commends the Minister's initiative to establish the interdepartmental committee, chaired by Senator Martin McAleese, to investigate and to set out the facts of the State's involvement with the Magdalen laundries, and his decision to establish a scheme to provide supports for the women involved;

supports the Minister's major programme of reform to the criminal and civil law, including:-- the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 dealing with the disclosure of information about serious offences committed against children or vulnerable adults;

recognises the important actions taken by the Minister to guarantee the stability of the Reserve Defence Force, including twinning reserve units with the Permanent Defence Force;

supports the renewed and enhanced role of the Permanent Defence Force in the UN international peacekeeping operation in Lebanon and also in the EU training missions in Mali and Somalia; and

expresses full confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter T.D.- (Minister for Health).</p></speech>

The question was about the unequal application of the law and a certain culture of at least some senior garda&iacute;.  The penalty points issue was not the only concern.  They were ignored, used the proper channels and came to TDs, which was their right.  This involves an important issue of the equal application of the law and what it means for society, reputation, impartiality and policing.</p><p>  We do not have the problems of other countries where there is widespread serious corruption and unlawful actions by the police, as well as places where it is positively dangerous to come into contact with the police.  I stress that we do not have that situation in Ireland, but the issues we have raised do have serious implications and should have been of more concern to the Minister.  His dismissive attitude has been absolutely contemptible.  The whistleblowers have been isolated and one has had to retire from his job.</p><p>  Deputy Mick Wallace has been slandered by the Minister.  I have been vilified for naming names to try to put the issue on the serious platform that is required.  The fact is that the whistleblowers, as well as TDs such as myself, Clare Daly, Mick Wallace and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, have been vindicated, compared to those who tried to sweep the issues under the carpet.</p><p>  An independent inquiry is needed and a genuinely independent Ombudsman's office.  I support the no confidence motion.  It was a misjudgment on national television to use information from a conversation with the Garda Commissioner to undermine a TD.  It was done smugly and with glee.</p><p>  I am also supporting the motion because of the Minister's inability to deal with the insolvency crisis and mortgage debt, as well as families who are in deep crisis with their mortgages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.704" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900050#YY01200"><p>I would like to clarify again the position regarding the issuing of fixed charge notices to Members of the Oireachtas.  Comments have been reported in the media to the effect that TDs are exempt from liability for road traffic offences on their way to or from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This assertion is simply incorrect.  When the Minister was asked to give a breath test and failed to do so, why was he not brought down to the Garda station - I am not asking that he be brought down in handcuffs like Deputy Clare Daly - and tested to see if he was over the limit, just like everyone else?  Why did the Minister mention that he was coming back from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?</p><p>  If the Minister intends to morally lecture the rest of us, he should be aware that the soapbox on which he is standing is resting on quicksand that is rapidly disappearing under him.  Let us look at the case of Fr. Niall Molloy, a former Roscommon man of the year.  When in opposition, the Minister said he was going to help that family.  He is not helping them, however, and the family has told me so.  The garda&iacute; tell them one thing while the Minister tells them another, and these people are at the end of their tether.  The Minister should remember therefore that the soapbox he stood on when in opposition is not on solid ground.</p><p>  I must put the Minister on notice that I, too, have made a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner about how the Minister released protected information about me into the public realm.  However, the Minister probably already knows that because he is their boss.  Is that not right?  He has probably already chatted to them because information does not stay where it should with the Minister.  He moves it around, depending on how it suits him politically.</p><p>  The most important reason why I think the Minister should step down is because of the way he has treated the whistleblowers.  During yesterday's debate, Government TDs came in to tell us about what the Minister did concerning apologies for the Magdalen laundries, <i>et cetera</i>.  Let me remind the Minister that if whistleblowers had been listened to in the Magdalen laundries, instead of being chucked back in there by the garda&iacute;, there would have been no need for an apology.  The same applies to the way the Minister is treating the whistleblowers now.  They are heroes who should be running the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not running away from it.  The Minister is chasing them out.  He should resign.</p></speech>

However, the Minister was cold, callous and uncaring, particularly in his treatment of Army wives and girlfriends who represented their husbands and partners in this matter.  He refused to come to Clonmel to see the fine facility that was there, thus ensuring that approximately 150 members of the Defence Forces lost their positions in Clonmel.  They either had to retire early or travel to work in Limerick, Kilkenny or elsewhere.  That put huge pressure on local families and Clonmel's business people.  The closure of the barracks was a major blow to the local people and the fabric of the town.</p></speech>

Those questions concerned whether he was stopped by a Garda, if his behaviour was cordial, and if he was treated the same as anybody else.  Was he cautioned and did he attempt to use D&aacute;il privilege?  His convoluted answer that took five and a half hours last Friday, and his ten-page speech last night - one page of which referred to the facts - did not answer the questions.</p><p>  Last night, the Minister fudged the question about whether he used constitutional privilege.  He needs to be explicit on that.  I know he did and it has been put to me that he did.  In his capacity as Minister, he can ask the Garda Commissioner to ascertain directly from the garda&iacute; on duty what exactly occurred.  Until he does this, he must realise that by implication he is accusing the garda&iacute; of malicious lies.  I do not say that lightly.  The Minister's behaviour has been outrageous.</p><p>  Last night, Government TDs talked about a reforming Minister, but he is one of the most dangerously unfit Ministers I have ever seen in the Department of Justice and Equality.  For a long time I have questioned whether the Justice and Defence portfolios should be under his aegis.</p><p>  I want to re-echo what Deputy Healy said.  The Minister treated the people of south Tipperary with disdain, as he treats most people.  The Minister has questions to answer but he has not answered them.  I believe that in the fullness of time the truth will come out.  The Minister knows what he did.  Maybe his passenger on the night could clarify what happened, if he can not.</p><p>  No suggestion was ever made by me that the Minister had alcohol taken.  That was never mentioned to anybody, so the Minister should not try to muddy the waters like he did with the dates and everything else.  His behaviour was totally unacceptable as it is most days in the Chamber.  The Minister talked about Bills, but the only Bills he introduced are ones to create misery.</p><p>The Minister has no respect and has not supported the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or given it the tools of the trade to do its job.  The Minister should have respect for the Garda.  The Minister almost single handedly defeated the last referendum on the Houses of the Oireachtas inquiries.  He knew more than ten former Attorneys General.  He is a fount of knowledge and everything else.</p><p> I call Deputies Shatter, Hogan and Reilly the troika or cabal of Ministers.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly was here last night giving Deputy Shatter a splendid defence and calling him a reforming Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is unfit for office.  He should answer the questions he was asked.  I am surprised the Taoiseach has not asked him.  Where is the report card he had for the Minister?  He is out of paint or his pages are full up.  The Minister's record is damning.  He can look behind him for solace.  All those backbenchers who are so proud of him should go out and find the facts themselves.

There are very many other serious issues but the Minister is sailing close to the wind here.  He is not being truthful.  I do not want to use the word "lie" but he is making liars of other people and it is outrageous.  It is contempt for the electorate that gave this Government its mandate.</p></speech>

A venial sin has been turned into a hanging offence.  The mock outrage of Fianna F&aacute;il Members makes them look ridiculous.  I thought Fianna F&aacute;il had embarked on a new departure.  I thought when the previous Cabinet had either run away or been sacked by the electorate that the new young men would be different, policy-driven, prepared to play the ball not the man.  No more Punch and Judy shows, we were told.  I thought before long we would be like Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, that we would all be exclaiming, &quot;O brave new world, That has such people in't!&quot;.  Unfortunately there is no brave new world in Fianna F&aacute;il.  The bright young men have reverted to type: bushwhackers and character assassins.</p><p>  Of all the topics Fianna F&aacute;il Members could have selected for Private Members' time, why did they select a confidence vote on a very competent Minister whose record of reform is unsurpassed?  It is because they cannot credibly discuss the main policy issues of the day.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members cannot talk about the economy because they wrecked it and they hope if they do not mention it at all the electorate may have a bout of amnesia.  They cannot talk about the banks because Fianna F&aacute;il's disastrous policies regarding Anglo Irish Bank and the bank guarantee have cost the taxpayers a king's ransom measured in billions of euro.</p><p>  They cannot criticise the local property tax because it was they who agreed it with the troika, and as recently as the 2012 budget they proposed a flat rate property tax.  Anyway, the Revenue is doing a brilliant job of collecting the tax.  They cannot credibly talk about the Haddington Road agreement because, unlike their own public service pay and pension cutting exercise when unilateral action without consultation was taken, the Haddington Road agreement has been negotiated with all the stakeholders involved.  They cannot credibly discuss the protection of maternal life Bill because Fianna F&aacute;il is hopelessly divided on the issue and does not have a party position.</p><p>  If the major policy issues of the day cannot be discussed with credibility in Private Members' time, then personality politics might look like a good option.  One can only be astounded at the cynicism of the party which, having wrecked the economy, destroyed the banks, put hundreds of thousands of people out of work, savaged the living standards of so many, made the poor poorer, knocked 50% off the value of family homes, drove our young people out of the country and surrendered the sovereignty of this Republic, still has the neck to launch a personal attack on the Minister for Justice and Equality.  They should be ashamed of themselves.</p></speech>

I have known the Minister for a couple of decades.  We have worked together in the past but never as closely as in Cabinet.  He has brought a sense of dynamism and energy to the Department in a consistent and clear way and I can think of very few of his predecessors who have been able to do as much as he has done in such a short period of time.  He has made decisions which other people did not have the courage to make.  Although reality necessitated that they be made, other people ran away from them.</p><p>  Deputy Healy has left the Chamber but if we want to have a modern Army we needed to get the sort of changes that were proposed not just in Kickham Barracks, but in other barracks as well.  The combination of two portfolios in one, defence and justice, has given the Minister an extraordinary overview of the situation in this country and the needs.  The suggestion for the closing of barracks originated with the Garda.  The Minister did not go out in the night and try to identify buildings that should be closed.  The Opposition Members know just how ineffective some of those Garda stations were.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is a member of Fine Gael working closely with colleagues from the Labour Party in this coalition that is attempting to rebuild this country that was so systematically destroyed by Fianna F&aacute;il, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan has described.  We are having a three-hour debate on a motion of confidence in this man here beside me who has worked extraordinary changes in such a short period of time, and has more to come.  He has given a dignity to all the people who have come here who have sought to become Irish citizens in the citizenship ceremony that now takes place.  For people who have been here for many years and who have contributed to our economy in hospitals and so many different aspects of life, that ceremony is real and tangible.  I would recommend that any Deputy who has not had the opportunity to observe it at first hand should do so.  For those reasons and many more, which time prevents me from identifying, the Labour Party and I have full confidence in the role of Deputy Shatter as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence.</p></speech>

We are too close to one another, too political, competitive and ideologically polarised.  Nobody in this room has not already formed a view and an opinion about everybody else.  We all have our preconceived prejudices, political, personal and ideological and I am afraid it may have been these prejudices that drove this motion rather than any real conviction of wrong doing.  A motion of no confidence must be used judiciously and on matters of real import.  That is not what is happening here.  I accept that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, would have been wiser not to have shared the information about Deputy Wallace and I understand Deputy Wallace's annoyance and hurt but that slip was in no way reflective of some sinister, Big Brother plan, as has been suggested.</p><p>  The other issue is merely a puff of smoke.  To be stopped by a garda at a mandatory checkpoint is certainly not a crime.  It happens to hundreds every year.  It is neither remarkable nor relevant.  What is relevant is the Minister, Deputy Shatter's performance and record as a Minister and that is beyond question.  Nobody can question his competence, work record, reforming zeal and ability to put national interest before local and sectoral interest.  That is what the public wants and demands of us.  That is the standard by which they will judge us all.  Those, above all, are the qualities which inspire confidence.  It would be a tragedy and a travesty if, on the very rare occasion that those qualities come together in one politician, there should be any expression of lack of confidence by his peers.</p><p>  I share a constituency with the Minister and every time I read about Dublin South in the media they talk about the competition between us, and they are not wrong.  There is competition between us.  We tread carefully around one another.  We both sup with a long spoon.  However none of that blinds me to the inescapable fact of his abilities and that what drives the Minister is solely his determination to serve the public interest and I have absolute confidence in that.  I accept that the remarks about Deputy Wallace were indiscreet and hurtful; the Minister genuinely regrets them and he has apologised.  Who among us has not been indiscreet and regretted something we said or did?  One indiscretion does not define this Minister.  He is defined by his record and his promise, and this country is extremely fortunate to have a Minister of his calibre at this difficult juncture in our country's fortunes.</p><p>I ask the Opposition to accept it would be a gross injustice to give greater weight to a single indiscretion made in the heat of a television programme than to the Minister's undisputed record of excellence and achievement.</p></speech>

Eight months after a Fianna F&aacute;il motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the party is at it again, this time with a different Minister in its sights, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  Fianna F&aacute;il knows full well this is another charade designed to get the party the media coverage it so longs for since the good old days of being in government.  It must be part of the programme of recovery for Fianna F&aacute;il.  I wonder who will be next.  Will the party wait so long the next time? This carry-on ignores the fact it is wasting valuable time.  Fianna F&aacute;il claims to be reflecting the public mood while it points out its lack of support for the Minister's actions and policies and claims he has made huge errors of judgement.  What I hear from the public, however, is that people are in no mood for grandstanding, posturing or unsupported allegations-made by anybody in this House.  They can see through this time wasting exercise.</p><p>  The proposers of this motion tonight have no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  They do not believe they can rely on him,<i></i>trust him to do his job or tell us the truth.  All I can say to that is - they do not know him very well.  Since the day he took office he has worked tirelessly on his ministerial responsibilities.  Having been in opposition for so long, he knew exactly what he wanted to do and what he needed to do for the people of this country.  He is a reforming Minister.  His prodigious output of work includes the enactment of 14 pieces of legislation, with three Bills currently progressing through the Oireachtas and a further five at advanced stages of drafting.  One of the most memorable nights in this Chamber came about as a result of the Minister's work with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the Magdalen Laundries issue.  This resulted in a State apology and the establishment of a fund for the benefit of the women concerned.</p><p>  In spite of efforts to paint a picture of a Minister who has his face set against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fact is this Minister is the champion of the force, having successfully negotiated additional funding on its behalf, securing to date a total of &euro;415 million more than the sum contained in the Fianna F&aacute;il national recovery plan.  Garda numbers are also currently higher than they would have been if that plan had been implemented.  As part of Defence Forces reform, the Minister has initiated the preparation of a Green Paper on defence, which will be published soon.</p><p>  Upon taking office the Minister, Deputy Shatter, discovered a backlog of 22,000 applications for citizenship, some of which had been awaiting decision for in excess of three years.  Most of these have now been dealt with and the persons in question have attended the formal citizenship ceremonies which were initiated by the Minister in 2011.  I also mention the Minister's work on the personal insolvency service and on prison form.  I have full confidence in the ability of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to carry out his duties truthfully and with diligence and integrity, and I heartily reject this motion of no confidence.</p></speech>

In fairness, his reference in that regard was owed to the party's revolutionary past rather than to its commitment to the rule of law, a commitment it still has.  That revolutionary past was brought to the Department of Justice where many fundamental reforms were carried out.  Various Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers brought through revolutionary legislation in that Department.  However, the revolution ground to a halt long ago.  Under the last Government, Bills such as the immigration Bill languished for ever on the shelves so that our figures for processing asylum claims matched those of Greece almost as closely as our economic trajectory matched that of the same country.  Similarly, people waited for citizenship, waiting hopelessly for a reply to their applications that could not and would never come.  In fact the Fianna F&aacute;il Party changed our citizenship laws so that every child born in this State is no longer automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  That, from a party that professes to be a republican party.</p><p>  Since he came to power, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has published a new version of that immigration and asylum Bill and has taken on many suggestions in that regard that came from all sides of the House.  He has published what amounts to revolutionary legislation in the Personal Insolvency Act, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Justice Act, the National Vetting Bureau Act and many other reforms that were so badly needed, given the abject lack of reform for so long in the preceding period.</p></speech>

I had intended to cover Garda figures and the fact that this Government has protected them at a higher level than Fianna F&aacute;il did.  It consulted with both the GRA and the AGSI with regard to pay measures which, although painful, are necessary.  That is something the previous Government also failed to do.</p></speech>

In the course of the past week, I have been struck by the number of times the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been described by commentators, including critics, as being highly intelligent and extremely hard-working.  He apologised in this House, not once but twice, while the political party that brought this country to its knees believes it has nothing for which to apologise.</p><p>  As Minister of State in the Department of Defence, I have had the opportunity to work closely with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and I can confirm that the first task that faced him on entering office was to deal with the funding deficit left by the previous Government.  This was a result of its national recovery plan which had allocated amounts that were inadequate to pay the wages and pensions of personnel or to provide for essential equipment and supplies for the Defence Forces.  As Minister, Deputy Shatter has secured the agreement of Government to stabilise the strength of the Defence Forces at 9,500.  He has led a difficult and far-reaching programme of reform to ensure that the redeployment and re-organisation of the Defence Forces went ahead.</p><p>  As Chief Whip, I have had a unique opportunity to observe the manner in which the Minister has tackled legislative reform.  I will not mention the long list of legislation he has steered though this House in recent months.  The Government has a long-term vision for areas of justice and defence which goes well beyond the correction of legacy issues around budgets.  The previous Government dodged making difficult decisions but the reform process must start with making tough decisions.  However, in the years under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, these reforms have been set in train and will bear fruit for years to come.</p><p>  In the long term the grandstanding of the Deputies opposite will fool nobody.  I cannot overlook the contribution made by Deputy Mattie McGrath in the circus of recent days.  The comparison made by Deputy Buttimer last night to Lyndon Johnson hit the nail on the head.  The former President used to say, &quot;Of course the allegation is untrue but let's make him deny it&quot;.  Deputy McGrath asked a question deliberately loaded with innuendo and sought to create an entirely false impression.  He seems to think that if he repeats the words &quot;Garda&quot; and &quot;breathalyser&quot; often enough he will prove some kind of point.  The Members of this House are allowed to speak without fear of being sued for defamation.  This invaluable privilege is given to us so that our democratic debate can be conducted freely and without fear of the threat of litigation.  It is not given to us in order to facilitate slander or innuendo, or to promote the spread of malicious gossip.  Deputy McGrath has cynically abused D&aacute;il privilege in an attempt to cast a shadow over the good name of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  The facts of the situation have been placed before the House by the Minister and that should have been the end of the matter.  However, having made his outlandish allegation, Deputy McGrath cannot back it up and now seems uncertain of his source.  I have a word of advice for Deputy Mattie McGrath.  He should be careful not to believe every yarn he hears in every pub.</p></speech>

In my office I was listening to Deputy Mattie McGrath, who unfortunately is not present in the Chamber just now.   The Deputy said this was the gravest and most serious issue - is he for real?  The idea that this issue is the gravest and most serious issue facing the country right now is ridulous, as is the fact that Private Members' time on both Tuesday and Wednesday had to be dedicated to this trivial issue.</p><p>  I also heard the Deputy claim that he &quot;knew&quot; the Minister had used parliamentary privilege.  This is the same man who gets his sources from people hanging around Pembroke Street outside allegedly &quot;pretty&quot; bars, at some date between 2008 and 2011.  He could not get that date right.  I understand he also claimed there was a Garda file on this incident but we have not yet seen it.  This is a Deputy who, as I understand it, opposes the Road Traffic Act 2001, one of the outcomes of which was to lower the alcohol limit in terms of road testing.  On that occasion, in one memorable contribution, Deputy McGrath suggested that drink was a sedative.  In public he stated, &quot;It can make people who are jumpy on the road or nervous be more relaxed&quot;.  He should follow his own prescription.</p></speech>

It is ridiculous that we are debating a motion of no confidence on this issue when, as the Minister for Finance rightly noted, so many issues befall this country in terms of the economy and unemployment.  Where are the throngs of people in the Visitors Gallery baying for blood and demanding that Minister be dragged to the guillotine?  They are not there.

Bills that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, introduced as a backbencher and Opposition Deputy brought fundamental changes to the areas of justice, family law and health.  It is a matter of public record that the party opposite adopted many of his Bills as its own while it was in Government.  It had the confidence in him then to accept his assistance.  The Minister's ability as a legislator and a Parliamentarian is unchallengeable.  The book he wrote on family law is regarded as a reference book for all solicitors who work in this area.</p></speech>

Their evidence comes from a former member of their party, Deputy Mattie McGrath, who returned to this House in 2011 without the inconvenience of flying the Fianna F&aacute;il flag while continuing to wear the Charvet shirt.  It is alleged that the Minister alluded to parliamentary privilege when he informed a garda that he was on his way home from the D&aacute;il and had not been drinking.  This accusation is unfair and without foundation, and it should be withdrawn.  I fully and wholeheartedly support the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as a man who is leading the way in the legislative change and reform which this House will acknowledge is badly needed.</p></speech>

I followed with great interest the reports on the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, at which Deputy Martin declared, "if you want destructive politics-as-usual, if you want blinkered all-out opposition, then the Fianna F&aacute;il Party I lead is not for you".  He said those words at the end of April and it now the end of May.  It is said that a week is a long time in politics but the last month must have brought significant change in the Fianna F&aacute;il position because this motion is the worst type of politics as usual.  It is opportunistic and politically driven, and it bears no relation to the Minister's ability to do his job.  The Minister is a capable, intelligent and extremely hardworking individual who does not shy away from difficult issues.  I have no hesitation in expressing my full confidence in him and I look forward to this issue being put to bed so that he can continue with his reforming work in the Department of Justice and Equality and we can get on with the business of dealing with the important issues that face the country.</p></speech>

At 9 p.m. we will put this piece of political opportunism behind us in order to allow him to return to dealing with issues such as the Mental Capacity Bill, which will make a difference to the lives of many people with disabilities.  His work ethic and commitment is beyond reproach.  He navigated many laws onto the Statute Book in the past two years and published many more.  He has been the driving force behind many of this Government's initiatives.</p><p>  I understand the need for political theatre on occasion but this is more pantomime than Plato.  The Minister has been consistent in his answers while his opponents have altered their facts, moved the goalposts, changed their stories and engaged in hypocrisy.  Some Members appear to find the Minister's intelligence disconcerting.  Perhaps they prefer the old Killinascullyesque backslapping opportunistic parish pump politics but I, for one, find his ability reassuring and encouraging for this country.</p></speech>

Since taking up this role, I have been highly impressed by the Minister's work rate, his ability and his attention to detail.  Many of the Bills we examine are extraordinarily detailed, complex and important.  It would more appropriate for us to deal with serious policy issues and if Fianna F&aacute;il Members had devoted their time, talent and energy to any one of these issues we could have had a proper debate with relevance to the people.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is probably one of the best Ministers for Justice and Equality we ever had.  The amount of legislation that he produces is unbelievable.  If I have any complaint to make about him it is that he works too hard because it means we have to work hard to keep up with him.  Deputy Calleary will agree with me because he has worked closely with the Minister as a member of the joint committee.</p><p>  The Minister is not afraid to challenge sacred cows with his reform indicatives but even Homer nods.  He made a mistake and he apologised for it.  That should have been the end of the matter but we have instead devoted three hours of parliamentary time to the issue.  Deputy Mattie McGrath made all sorts of accusation without presenting a scintilla of evidence in support.  We could be dealing with many different issues that impact on the people instead of wasting time.</p><p>  The Minister went to Cork and made the decision to build a new prison.  He went to Limerick and initiated a major refurbishment of the prison there.  This is a man who makes decisions and gets things done.</p></speech>

The publication of that report was a direct result of the work done by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in Opposition when his courageous decision to publish the Tracy Faye report forced the previous Government into action and a transparency it had previously avoided.  His time as Opposition spokesperson for children was typified by a commitment to reform, a dedication to change and a capacity for hard work.  Those same traits apply to the work he now does as Minister.  He has introduced legislation that fundamentally changed the protection of children and vulnerable people in this State.  His enactment of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 provided a different architecture to criminal law in preventing and prosecuting abuses of our most vulnerable people.</p><p>  His commitment to reform is also evident in other areas.  The changes he is bringing to the secrecy of family court proceedings will provide transparency and dignity to countless families.  His pioneering vision of a reorganised system of family courts reflects the extensive personal experience and expertise he brings to his portfolio and the reforming zeal and commitment he applies to all his work.  This work will make a tangible difference to families in their toughest hours by removing the sting of the courts from family law disputes and encouraging a more conciliatory and reflective approach to family dispute resolution.  It may take some time but it will change the system so that mothers and fathers will see that they are treated fairly and our courts are subjected to public scrutiny.</p><p>  Previous Ministers have had opportunities to introduce these reforms but few have bothered.  The reason the Minister, Deputy Shatter, bothers is not because of his widely recognised expertise in family law.</p><p>He bothers because he cares about the individuals who must navigate the system, how they are treated and how the State delivers for them.  There is no better example of his caring attitude towards people who were previously ignored by the State than the citizenship ceremonies he has initiated.  While they may appear like a small thing, if the Deputies opposite ever visit one of these ceremonies, they will recognise that they are not a small thing for those participating and in attendance.</p><p> We have, in the Minister, a man who is absolutely dedicated to the task facing him, who is eminently qualified and cares about what he does.  I fully support the motion of confidence in him.  His colleagues and the House have confidence in him.  The tabling of the motion by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is inappropriate and disproportionate.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is responsible for all of our current woes.  While the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, referred to a number of these, he could have included the 40% increase in Government expenditure the party presided over between 2000 and 2007.  Further, monthly job losses were running at 10,000 per month when the party left power.  More than 1,000 jobs are being created each month under this Government.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party almost single-handedly destroyed our reputation abroad.</p><p>  Tonight, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has decided to give up discussing real politics.  As a party handcuffed by its history, it is resorting to playing the man.  In the Minister for Justice and Equality, however, they have chosen the one Minister who embodies everything that Fianna F&aacute;il is not.  He is a person of integrity, conviction and no small amount of bottle, a reforming Minister and, in my experience of only two and a half years in the House, a person of great compassion and warmth.  He has done more than any other Minister to show the country can once again have faith in politics.</p></speech>

There is no division over the Government's commitment to proceed with solving the economic crisis.  Of all the Ministers in government, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is the most determined, resolute and fearless.  He has tackled all the issues that have arisen in his Department with absolute clarity.  He has done what few Ministers have ever done, for example, in tackling judges' pay when some members of the Judiciary refused to accept the same salary reductions as everyone else in the public sector.  He ensures things are done correctly and properly.  He was responsible for the Government apology for the Magdalen laundries which Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in previous Governments were unable to provide.  The Minister's record is clear.</p><p>  Members of the public want the Oireachtas to deal with the economy and engage in tangible debates.  They do not want the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to become the stooges of the Independent Members.  Tonight, people at home are not turning to their television sets but reaching for the telephone or Skype to call members of their families living thousands of miles away.  They want the Opposition to tackle the Government on issues such as unemployment and use Private Members' time, sacred as it is, to engage in tangible debates.  Instead, Fianna F&aacute;il is abusing and wasting Private Members' time on a useless motion that will not go anywhere.  </p><p>  The facts are clear; there is no record or report about a Deputy being drunk and refusing to take a breathalyser test.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party persists with a lie when there is nothing to substantiate the allegation that has been made.  I suggest it start to deal with the real issues of the economy and put the Government to the test by debating its policies rather than wasting time tabling pointless, useless, spineless motions such as that before us.</p></speech>

It is incredible that the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party are denying the Fianna F&aacute;il Party the right to pursue its duty of holding the Government to account by tabling motions in Private Members' time.  Irrespective of whether we had tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, or a motion on policy, this Private Members' debate presents us with an opportunity to highlight our view on what should be done in the areas of policing and defence.</p><p>  A number of speakers stated the Minister does not like to play the man but prefers to play the ball.  One of the reasons my party decided to table another motion of no confidence in the Minister, having tabled a similar motion in the Seanad in February, long before the incident involving Deputy Wallace and the second incident involving the Minister on Pembroke Road came to light, was that we do not have confidence in the manner in which the Minister performs his duties.  He has been confrontational and has undermined rank and file members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who work at the coalface delivering policing in our communities.  It would be remiss of any Opposition party to fail to table a motion of no confidence in a Minister when garda&iacute; do not have confidence in him.  We have an obligation to do so.</p><p>  While I have had a number of run-ins with the Minister, this motion is not personal in nature.  The Minister, however, got personal when, on a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme, he used confidential information that was passed to him by the Garda Commissioner to denigrate and undermine a citizen and Member of this House.  The motion has been successful in that it resulted in the Minister eventually apologising to Deputy Wallace and accepting that his actions were wrong.  This apology, of itself, was critically important.  We cannot allow a perception to gain ground among members of the public or Members of the Oireachtas that we have a Minister for Justice and Equality who can receive confidential briefings from the Garda Commissioner that could be used at some stage in the future.  That the Minister was forced to come to the House and state he does not receive such briefings was sufficient reason to table the motion of no confidence.  He accepted his action was wrong and stated that, in hindsight, he would not have done what he did if he had given the matter some thought.  It was important that he made that statement.</p><p>  On the incident that took place on Pembroke Road, the only information in my possession is that which I have read.  The easiest way to clear up the matter would be for the Minister to ask the Garda Commissioner to carry out an investigation into the matter and furnish a report on it.  The incident took place in 2008 or early 2009 - neither the Minister nor I is sure of the precise date.  I am certain, however, that if the Minister were to ask the Garda Commissioner to investigate what took place on the evening in question, the matter would be cleared up quickly.  While I do not know if a Garda report was made to the relevant Garda station, I do know the Minister was stopped because he said this himself.  He also mentioned that he was coming from the D&aacute;il.  The question is whether he invoked Article 15.13 of the Constitution, which was introduced for all the right reasons.  These do not include using the article to decline to blow into a breathalyser.</p><p>  The Minister may shake his head but the article in question was introduced for good reason and should not be used lightly on Pembroke Road to refuse to blow into an intoxilyzer.  As I stated, the Minister could clear up this matter quickly by asking the Commissioner to carry out a full investigation, furnish a report to the Minister and present it to the House.  If there was not a breach or abuse of privilege under Article 15.13 and no animosity or discourtesy was shown by the Minister to garda&iacute;, that is fine.  However, until such time as the matter has been cleared up, these issues will be left hanging.  I am not the only person who takes that view.  The matter has been reported in national newspapers and sources have supported the allegation that a report was made on the matter.  While I do not know if that is the case, the Minister could find out quickly.  If there was no report, he could ask the Commissioner to insist on asking the garda&iacute; who were present on Pembroke Road on the night in question to file one.</p><p>  On the broader issue, earlier we had Fine Gael Party Deputies and even Labour Party Deputies piling in to praise the Minister's reforming capacity in a way that recalled an episode of the &quot;This is Your Life&quot; programme.  We all expect Ministers with responsibility for justice and defence to reform continually.  The Department of Justice and Equality has a heavy legislative programme and no one can argue that the Minister's predecessors were idle while in the Department.</p><p>The Department has churned out a huge amount of legislation in recent years.</p><p> The most interesting aspect of the commentary relating to this matter relates to the contribution of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I admire the Minister because he is a sort of latter day Churchillian character who has been engaged in saving the country in recent times.</p></speech>

The Minister displayed a serious lack of judgment.  Any individual can display such a lack of judgment.  The point now is that he must resolve this matter very quickly in order to ensure that people can have confidence in him and in the justice system.  Every citizen in this State has an obligation to comply with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they are requested to do so.  I am appalled by the fact that any Deputy could besmirch Article 15.13 of the Constitution which, as the Minister knows, was put in place for a very good reason.  It is simply unacceptable that it could be used lightly and glibly by someone stopped at the side of the road.</p></speech>

This was long before the matter relating to Deputy Wallace and the Pembroke Street episode came to light.  The point is that there is major disquiet among rank and file garda&iacute;, who went so far as to table motions of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality at their conferences.  They stated that they have no confidence in him.  This must be the first occasion in the history of the State that the rank and file garda&iacute; who keep our communities safe night after night have voted no confidence in a person who is ultimately in charge of the force.  If we were to fail to table a motion of no confidence in the Minister in the wake of what has happened, it would simply beggar belief.  We have an obligation to expose the fact that there is no connection between him and garda&iacute; who operate on the ground.</p><p>  There is also the matter of the closure of police stations.  The Minister has stated that this is not a cost-saving exercise and that it is, rather, a management decision that will lead to better policing in communities throughout the country.  All of the Deputies seated behind the Minister disagree with him.  Obviously, they will vote confidence in him tonight and will trundle through the lobbies along with their counterparts in the Labour Party.  At this stage, the latter are really wasting their time in government.  We thought that they might at least have some say in respect of the direction in which things should be going.  However, they have completely absolved themselves of any responsibility in that regard.  The key issue which arises is that the Minister has decided - by his actions - to single-handedly undermine ordinary garda&iacute; throughout the country on a daily basis.  They said this themselves at their conferences.  It is they who have no confidence in the Minister.</p></speech>

We have the usual sniffy response from Government to the effect that we are wasting time discussing what is, in its view, a minor issue.  As Deputy Kelleher stated, what we witnessed earlier was similar to an episode of &quot;This is Your Life&quot;.  In light of the paucity of Labour Deputies in the House, however, we are awaiting the arrival not of the red book but rather of the blue book detailing the Minister's achievements.</p><p>  The abuse of confidential information by a Minister for Justice and Equality is an issue which must be discussed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and judgment must be passed.  The happenings in Pembroke Street also need to be debated in the House.  I have no intention of criticising the Minister's work record.  He has worked hard and realised some substantial achievements since entering office.  However, the full list of those achievements as outlined in the Government's amendments is about as believable as some of the Minister's fiction.  Being hard-working does not necessarily always equate to being effective.  I cite the Minister's performance on the Legal Services Regulation Bill as a case in point.  That Bill was introduced in December 2011 but as a result of his taking personal charge of matters, its passage through the Houses has not proceeded.  I am aware that consultations are taking place with interested bodies but no reports of progress have been provided to the House.</p><p>  During my time shadowing the Minister I saw two Deputy Shatters.  For many people, it is difficult enough to be obliged to deal with just one.  As Deputy Stanton stated, there is a Deputy Shatter who, when dealing with legislation before select committees, can be very generous with both is legal knowledge and political experience.  During our time opposite each other, the Minister was accommodating in the context of amendments.  If he could not accept them, he dealt with them in a civil fashion, pointed out the legal position and gave guidance on how to pursue the matters to which they related in other ways.  He always briefed us on issues of security importance and made the officials of his Department available to assist us in debating legislation he was introducing.  That was welcome.  When he dealt with uncontentious parliamentary questions, the Minister could be interesting and even funny and witty.</p><p>  There is, however, another Deputy Shatter.  I refer to the one who cannot resist an audience.  It is the Deputy Shatter who must punch the man who might disagree with him rather than dealing with the issue.  In the words of one of his supporters - I refer to Deputy Lowry who, I gather, is going to vote confidence in the Minister - he is irritatingly dismissive and brash.  That is the side of the Minister's personality which has brought us here this evening.  It is also the side of his personality which led him to treat the confidential information he had on Deputy Wallace in such a contemptuous fashion and to use it on a live programme on national television in order to score a political point.  If we are to assume that he, as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence, is in receipt of confidential information on a daily basis, it is also fair to assume that there has been a breach of trust between him and the Garda Commissioner in respect of such information.  In future, the Garda Commissioner is going to be obliged to ask himself whether the Minister is going to use any information provided to him - perhaps on live television - in order to score political points.  One could not blame him for doing so.  Regardless of what the choir behind him states, the essential bond of trust that exists between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner - and between the Minister for Defence and the Chief of Staff for that matter - has been broken.  For that reason alone, we cannot continue to have confidence in the Minister.</p><p>  Yesterday and again today, the <i>Irish Independent</i> published very detailed allegations and an in-depth account with regard to what is supposed to have happened on Pembroke Street on a particular evening.  Some of those in the choir behind the Minister have been asking if any of us on this side were present when he was stopped that night.  I was not there.  The only people present were the Minister and a number of garda&iacute;.  However, somebody feeding information to the <i>Irish Independent</i> seems to think that they were there.  In the context of a speech which ran to nine pages and in which he listed all his achievements - the only line the Minister missed out on delivering was that on the seventh day he rested-----</p></speech>

I hope that the person on the Government side who gets the opportunity to deliver the ministerial conclusion in respect of this debate will deal with those allegations.  On the night in question, was the Minister, who is also a solicitor and an officer of the court, unco-operative - to the point of being rude - with the garda&iacute; on the evening in question?  Did he say to a particular garda, "Check your law book, it&rsquo;s in the Constitution, you cannot stop me, I am going."?  Did he then drive off from the checkpoint on Pembroke Street?  Those are the specific allegations - printed in a national newspaper - with which the Minister did not deal last night.  If there is no basis to the specific allegations to which I refer, then I hope the person charged with providing the ministerial conclusion to this debate will dismiss them out of hand.  If the allegations are true, then we are in a very serious position and no amount of huffing or puffing or tributes from backbenchers will change that fact.  It is not acceptable that a Deputy who is also an officer of the court would treat a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performing their duty with contempt and arrogance.</p><p>  Ultimately, this matter comes down to trust.  As stated earlier, the Minister has lost the trust of many of the stakeholders in his Department.  It is difficult to see how the bond of trust between him and the Garda Commissioner and other senior public servants in possession of confidential information can be restored.</p><p>The only people who seem to trust him are his colleagues in government.  Frankly, enough has been said.</p></speech>

I also thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for allowing me some of its speaking time.  I support and will vote for the motion not because of the incident at a Garda checkpoint where it is claimed that the Minister's behaviour left much to be desired or because of the abuse of his powerful and privileged position through the leaking of information about Deputy Wallace.  All of those issues are a sideshow at a time when 450,000 people are seeking work and hundreds of thousands must emigrate.  There are far more important issues for the D&aacute;il to debate.</p><p>  I support the motion because of the Minister's disgraceful decision to close 140 Garda stations and because of his unhealthy relationship with the Garda Commissioner, a man who strongly objected to one of his predecessors at a lower rank getting an extension of time in his position.  The current Commissioner even went to court and gave evidence on how wrong it would be for the force if the then Assistant Commissioner were given an extension.  The then Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Martin Donnellan, lost his case against the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the High Court, during which the then Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, gave evidence that extending the retirement age to 65 years would cause an exodus of younger officers and a blockage in promotions.  I will quote what the current Minister stated when he made his decision to extend the Commissioner's term of office: &quot;it is desirable that there should be continuity in garda leadership, and I am delighted that Martin has agreed to this extension&quot;.  The Minister also stated: &quot;His leadership over this period, during which there will be further challenges to be met, will be invaluable.&quot;</p><p>  I respect the Commissioner and will not comment on him, but this was a sorry affair.  In making judgment, Mr. Justice William McKechnie referred to the then Deputy Commissioner's evidence against any proposal to extend the enforce age of retirement.</p><p>  Is it any wonder that no report could be found on the Minister?  There is no problem with everyone knowing everything about Deputy Wallace.  It is obvious that he has nothing to do with granting extensions of time for Commissioners in their powerful positions.  Did anyone think to ask the garda&iacute; on duty on the night of the Minister's incident about his comments and behaviour?  To echo Deputy Mattie McGrath, was the Minister's behaviour polite and cordial?  One telephone call would have cleared up this affair, but no one chose to make it.</p><p>  The Minister and this inept Government made the stupid decision to close Garda stations.  He misrepresented the facts by claiming that he was closing them to provide better policing, given the amount of time wasted by having garda&iacute; sitting in stations, yet he then contradicted himself by claiming that garda&iacute; would spend the same amount of time in community centres and Garda vans, holding clinic-like meetings with people in their communities.  I have proven that it costs more each day to keep these stations closed than it would to keep them open.</p><p>  The Minister has no respect for garda&iacute; and holds the people who represent them in contempt.  The only member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to whom he listens is the Commissioner.  The entire country knows that the Minister is firmly in bed with him.  Thanks to the Minister's behaviour, the general public has lost confidence in him.  Truth be told, it never had any confidence in him, only disappointment.</p></speech>

He will survive tonight's vote, of course, but the reality is that his position will be weakened and he will not be the same person that he once was.  Those who have backed him so vociferously have been somewhat discredited.  Given what Fine Gael and, in particular, Labour have stood over in the past two and a half years in order to cling to power, I am not surprised.  I have no more confidence in the rest of them than I do in the Minister - there is nothing personal about this.</p><p>  Serious issues lie at the heart of this debate.  The Government has sought to cover over the fundamental issues of democracy and accountability by slinging mud, insulting and back slapping.  The Minister's comments have received significant focus in the past ten days, but little attention has been paid to why he made them.  In my opinion, his efforts were a deliberate attempt to throw sand and divert attention from the important issues lying at the heart of investigations into Garda malpractice, namely, evidence somewhat revealed or somewhat left out of the penalty points report.  The Minister has consistently sought to trivialise and minimise these issues.</p><p>  I do not have time to go into all of the details, but a culture of writing off penalty points exists.  The evidence has not been challenged.  These are not minor matters.  This morning, I received correspondence from a parent who lost his 15 year old daughter a number of years ago to someone who was speeding.  People have supplied evidence about millions of euro in lost revenue, etc.</p><p>  The Minister told the House that he took these issues seriously.  He claimed that his Department received the information on these serious allegations in September and that he received it in October.  This cannot be true.  The Minister has failed to address the discrepancy in the Taoiseach's written evidence to the effect that he notified the Department of Justice and Equality in July, August and September.  The Minister has failed to address the fact that we have seen evidence suggesting that he knew of the existence of a whistleblower in January 2012.  He discussed these matters with the Commissioner in January and he read the reports in February.  The confidential recipient met him before Easter.  He handed an investigation into a complaint over to the Garda Commissioner, requiring the Commissioner to investigate himself.  The Minister was aware of these issues, yet he did nothing.</p><p>  Deputy Healy-Rae is quite correct, in that the Minister's relationship with the Commissioner is unhealthy and is under the spotlight.  Has the Minister not wondered how the Commissioner could tell him in four days that there was no report on the former's incident despite the fact that Garda procedures require not one, but two such reports, when it took the Commissioner four years to answer the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission regarding serious questions of malpractice?  Before an investigation starts, the same man can tell us that there is no culture of non-enforcement and can provide the Minister with information on Deputies.</p><p>  The Minister's colleagues hope to put this matter to bed and to move on, but he will not move on from this issue.  Many questions remain to be answered.</p></speech>

He failed to exercise any of the legislative options open to him, those being, to refer the controversy to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's office or to appoint a special independent inquiry.  He refused to explain to the House why he instead chose an internal Garda review.</p><p>  The Minister also failed to adhere to the two basic standards of constitutional fairness.  Setting up his internal review offended two constitutional principles - the rule against bias, by having senior garda&iacute; investigate themselves, and the rule to hear the other side, by conducting a six-month review without interviewing the whistleblowers or giving them an opportunity to put their case.</p><p>  The Minister refused to disclose to the House the internal review's terms of reference when asked to do so.  He refused to commit publicly to implementing the 12 fundamental changes on Garda cancellation policies and practices as recommended in the Garda professional standards unit's report.  Instead, he only committed to seven select principles from the report in his press statement.</p><p>  The Minister has shown a lack of concern at the probable unlawfulness of Garda discretion in cancelling fixed charge notices.  He refused to seek an opinion from independent senior counsel or even the Attorney General's office on the legality of the 2005 cancellation policy and the Garda's implementation of same.  In a cynical and underhanded manner, the Minister and the two reports that he commissioned failed to reference important legislation when discussing the legality of Garda discretion in this context, namely, section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  It is on the Statue Book, yet the Minister has yet to commence it.  As such, it is not in operation.  It replaces the word &quot;shall&quot; in the 1961 Act with &quot;may&quot; to permit the use of discretion, indicating an awareness on the part of the State that Garda discretion in terms of the PULSE system is unlawful.</p><p>I did not ask for an apology.  I am used to having muck thrown at me.  I did not ask the Minister to resign.  I am not interested in picking him out as I believe the Government as a unit is culpable because it has not prioritised the best interests of the ordinary people of this country but rather the interests of the EU, the ECB and the financial markets.</p><p> Of course the Minister will continue in office and have the backing of his colleagues but a major problem remains, namely, whether he will regain the confidence of the public, whether people believe his side of the story, if he can bring rank and file garda&iacute; with him-----</p></speech>

From listening to the debate so far I am reminded of one thing I have learned in life: that there is only one thing worse than being offended, that is to have others be offended on one&rsquo;s behalf because one feels one has to react and support them.  That is what has happened in this case.  The Minister&rsquo;s indiscretion should not have happened and he has now apologised twice for it.  Deputy Wallace has confirmed that he would never have gone to such extremes to vindicate his position in terms of the incident in question.  I do not know Deputy Wallace very well but from what I know of him he would not have gone to such extremes and he would not have become involved in the type of time wasting that has taken place in the Chamber for the past two nights.</p><p>  The Opposition is the Opposition.  It is entitled to table whatever motion it wishes.  That is acceptable.  We did it ourselves when we were in opposition but a motion of confidence is an extremely serious one and should be used sparingly.  To table a motion of confidence based on the type of information we have heard in recent weeks is a waste of time.  I do not say that lightly; I mean it.  There are so many valuable issues we could be discussing tonight.  For instance, we knew two weeks in advance that a damning report on cr&egrave;ches and the care of children in this country was due.  I heard many Deputies say they had not been given sufficient time to discuss the issue.  We could have been discussing the matter tonight, and last night.  Fianna F&aacute;il can table whatever motion it wishes in its Private Members&rsquo; time, but this motion is one with which no one in the country agrees.</p><p>  Of course the Garda is upset and annoyed at the way their pay and conditions have been cut.  Who is not upset?  In my area of responsibility, the Psychiatric Nurses Association is not very happy with me.  However, it is simply what we have to do in order to get the country back on its feet.

Having privilege in this House is unique.  It is something we should take very seriously.  I will not go through the record of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  Enough speakers have done that.  However, as was said to me during the week, the Minister was in a studio in the heat of an argument, as we all are from time to time, and he said something which he now clearly regrets.  Many a Minister for justice did not do that, but leaked information to the press instead so that a hatchet job could be done on a person.  To a great extent, this was as honest as one is going to get in regard to the Minister for justice.</p><p>  We must remember that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has taken on vested interests in his own area.  He has challenged sacred cows and put legislation in place to that effect.  I am not present to tell the House that the Minister works from 6 a.m. in the morning onwards.  To return to Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s closing remarks, the majority of people in this country realise the condition the country is in, but they know, equally, that there are far more important issues that we should be discussing.  As I said, there is nothing worse than for someone to be offended on one&rsquo;s behalf.  Deputy Wallace would not have gone to these extremes in order to vindicate his position.</p></speech>

However, we must all reflect on the lessons of recent weeks in particular.  In the brief time available I wish to focus on the two issues that have dominated public discourse on the Minister in recent weeks.  One is the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; debate.  During the debate on the public airwaves that night the Minister&rsquo;s reference to private information, which he collected in the course of very privileged duties, was a serious lapse of judgment.  It is very clear that neither the Minister nor his colleagues accepted the seriousness of the issue for a period.  It was pretty much a week after the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; show when he gave what could only be called a qualified apology to Deputy Wallace.  He said: &ldquo;If Deputy Wallace believes I did him a personal wrong by mentioning it, I have no problem in saying I am sorry.&rdquo;  We all know that is not a real apology.</p></speech>

It was not just about the Deputy, which was mentioned that night.  It was a much broader and more important issue than that.  At a time when the State is collecting more and more information on private citizens it is an issue of legitimate public concern and it is proper that the issue would be debated.  A full week after the incident the Minister clearly did not fully accept or realise the seriousness of what he did on that evening.</p><p>  On the revelations Deputy Mattie McGrath first brought into the public domain about the Pembroke Street incident in late 2008 and 2009, there is no suggestion that alcohol was in any way involved, but the one question that remains unanswered is whether the Minister in any way, explicitly or implicitly, invoked the constitutional protection Members of the Oireachtas enjoy travelling to and from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The fact is that we now have two very different versions of that event in the public domain.  We have the Minister's statements, which we must take in good faith, and we have the story yesterday and today in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which is very different.  The central message is that the Minister was not co-operative with the Garda.  I do not know whether to believe that but it was said that the Minister said to the garda on the night, &#8220;Don't you know who I am?&#8221;, that he did not say he was asthmatic, that he told the garda it was unconstitutional to stop him when he was going from the D&aacute;il and that he said the garda should check the law book.</p></speech>

If a newspaper wrongly made those allegations about me I would sue them because either they are correct or the Minister has been seriously defamed.  I would let nobody make such allegations about me.  That is a decision the Minister will make in his own good time.</p><p>  A follow-on story appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, presumably from a different source, which said, for example, that the garda involved believed in the course of the conversation with the Minister that he was suggesting that he could not be stopped or detained because he was travelling from the D&aacute;il.  I do not believe the journalist involved made all of that up.  Somebody clearly gave the newspaper this version of events.  It is in the public interest that we get to the bottom of the issue.</p><p>My colleague is correct; the only way to deal with this is to have the matter referred to the Commissioner, have it investigated and have a report issued in order that everyone knows where he or she stands.  There is one issue I do not understand fully.  The Minister did not just happen to tell the garda that evening that he was on his way home from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It was not like any other worker saying he or she was returning home from a factory.  Given the Minister's legal knowledge and expertise, he understood full well the import and implication of what he was saying to the garda that evening.</p></speech>

At the outset, I note any decision to table a motion of no confidence is not taken lightly.  In recent days I have stated repeatedly, in response to the Minister and others, that Members have reached a tipping point with the Minister in question.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members have been asked the reason they lodged this motion and they have reached this tipping point for a number of reasons, which I will summarise.  Fianna F&aacute;il has policy and political differences in respect of how the Minister has behaved.  Members have rehashed and aired the position in respect of Garda stations.  The Minister is rolling out a series of political failures, which are failing communities throughout the country.  However, that is part of a pattern of wider policies his colleagues in government are introducing.  The Government is closing down rural Ireland in particular.  It is closing libraries, courthouses, small schools, post offices and public health centres.</p></speech>

As Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister has a primary function to protect the public but it does not feel protected by him.  The public has lost confidence in the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il is taking the opportunity in this motion to articulate that loss of confidence on behalf of communities and the public.  It ill-behoves anyone to come into this Chamber to question Fianna F&aacute;il's legitimacy or its mandate to table that motion.  Much comment has been made in respect of the stakeholders, to the Judiciary and to the Garda representative associations.  In addition, Members spoke last night on the recent controversies regarding the RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; debate and the Pembroke Street incident, to which I will return.</p><p>  The Minister's contribution last night, when one studies the detail of what he said, was an amazing statement.  However, prior to that when, in the aftermath of the RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme, the Minister was queried and received some hostile comment from my party and others, his initial reaction was to treat it as a joke.  It was to ask how dare anyone do that.  It was to question whether any criticism of Alan Shatter was legitimate or was a joke and he tried to wave it away.  In his statement last night, he stated &quot;This is far removed from the sort of political circus we have seen over the past two weeks&quot;.  Who but the Minister is generating the circus?  He is the man at the centre of the circus and I will not tell him what people at the centre of the circus usually are, because I will not get into that and will not personalise this matter.  Thereafter, having finished claiming it was a joke and a circus, the Minister then decided to blame the media.  It was the media's fault and he sought to rubbish the <i>Irish Independent </i>with its authoritative version of events.  As for the other newspapers, neither I nor Fianna F&aacute;il wrote the editorials.  If the Minister simply wishes to rubbish all the media and their commentary, that is fine.</p><p>  If one turns to the remainder of the Minister's statement last night, one learns of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, the reformer.  This is supposed to give the Minister a free pass from everything else.  While it does not come as a surprise to me, it will come as a surprise to many of his colleagues, that most of the Bills that have been passed under his stewardship were already there when he walked in to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

Moreover, this is not a point being made by Fianna F&aacute;il, because the Government has a problem in accepting independent reports.  The Minister's criticism of the previous Government, to the effect that its members never attended European Union meetings and did not carry out their ministerial duties is a lie, which has been put paid to by an independent study.  The University of Gothenburg carried out an analysis and I will give Members opposite the facts in this regard.</p></speech>

As for the reason the attendance fell during the last few months, it was because the then Opposition, now in government, in a cynical political exercise withdrew the ministerial pairs.  That was the type of responsible politics in which the Government parties engaged, quite apart from the auction politics, when they were in opposition.</p><p>  If I turn to the Minister's apology, I note Deputy Wallace did not ask for the apology but of course, it was highly conditional.  It was dragged out of the Minister and was a tactic to try to defuse the situation.  However, that will be decided on by the Data Commissioner and the Standards in Public Office Commission.  What about an apology to the other people the Minister held to account when he was on this side of the House?  He called on others to resign, by the standard he set, but now he has been caught in the crossfire of that standard, he is not prepared to resign.</p></speech>

Incidentally, some of them did, for completely different reasons, and then the Minister would not credit them with that either.</p><p>  Moreover, the wider Government response is amazing.  Every motion tabled in this Chamber on a Wednesday evening during Private Members' time is a waste of time according to Government Members.  They do not respect the mandate and do not respect Members' right to raise matters in this House.

What did the Labour Party do to save its senior Ministers' relationship with Fine Gael?  It flushed one of its own out the gap and right over to the Opposition benches.  That tells one a lot about the Labour Party and the personalities at the top of it.</p></speech>

The questions hanging over the Minister are not personal matters but are in the public interest because the Minister is the officeholder.  The Minister must deal with the questions hanging over him because a cloud is hanging over him.  The Minister can ask the Garda Commissioner to generate a report and can put that report into the public domain, which would put the entire issue to bed.  The Minister has stated he has asked the Secretary General to check with the Garda Commissioner and no report can be found but that he cannot ask the Garda Commissioner to generate one.  As for the breathalyser sample, unlike the Minister, I am not a lawyer, something for which he gets great credit from all the speakers.  However, last night, he sought to confuse and muddy the issue in respect of the Road Traffic Act, by citing reasonable excuse.</p><p>He did that to take a side-swipe at the media to try to discredit them-----</p></speech>

A person who refuses or fails to comply with a requirement to provide a breath test cannot avail of the reasonable excuse defence.  The Minister saw fit here last night to avail of the reasonable excuse defence.</p><p>  The Minister has questions hanging over him and he must answer them.  He has the wherewithal to put a report into the public domain to clear the office.  That is the important point.</p><p>  I have summarised the issues we have with the Minister politically, those that are policy driven and those regarding the office he holds.  He has abused power for his own political gain.  He has closed Garda stations and taken a policy direction with which we disagree.  He has a relationship with the Garda Commissioner which we believe is now compromised.  He has a relationship with the Judiciary which is exceptionally compromised, and he has not overseen the proper workings of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman.</p><p>  I have not mentioned the Minister's attempt to shut down the Morris tribunal.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that I have given the figures on the average private sector wages, which is &euro;32,670.  It is reasonable to pick double that figure, &euro;65,000, as the income from which we can ask for an additional contribution.  It is a small sub-set of all public servants, as I indicated, at 13%.</p><p>  It would be difficult for us to bring in a reduction in pay and to exempt ourselves because, clearly, Deputies would come below the &euro;100,000 threshold that is suggested opposite.  Workers in the public sector would regard that as unacceptable.</p></speech>

This should not be done but if it is to be done at all, in the interests of transparency I put down an amendment that it should be done by way of regulation or by statutory instrument.</p><p>  If a Minister is making a concession in the education sector or the justice sector, it should be done by way statutory instrument rather than merely lodging it in the Labour Court.  The Minister knows as well as I do that what is discussed in the Labour Court and industrial relations matters are exempt from freedom of information and there is no mechanism for the public to see what is going on.  There can be a secret deal, which is exempt from freedom of information, in the Labour Court that led to the agreement being reached.  Then there could be inconsistent agreements being reached by different Ministers or different categories of public sector employment.  Only today, the Minister published legislation about mobility of staff in the public service.  It is not in anybody's interest that there would be deals done through this legislation that are not publicly available and the Ministers should be accountable to the House on any such deal.</p><p>  I will cut to the chase.  If the Minister or any of his colleagues is doing such deals or they are being done in any of the sectors, health, education, justice or the local authorities, the relevant Minister should lodge the details by way of statutory instrument.  It would allow at least for a mechanism by which they may be discussed in the Chambers if the Members choose to do so.</p><p>Without that facility different arrangements may be entered into across the eight different sectors and neither the public nor the Parliament will have any knowledge of those arrangements.  I ask that they be done by way of regulation rather than agreement solely in the Labour Court or Labour Relations Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.873" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900061#LLL00200"><p>Inserting the new section 2B into the parent Act means that an existing power to fix terms and conditions may be exercised by the relevant employer or Minister of the Government so as to result in less favourable remuneration other than core salary, which is unaffected by the power, or in increased hours for the public servants concerned, notwithstanding any of the terms of any enactment, contract or otherwise provided for.  This provision will not apply to any group of public servants for whom remuneration is set by primary legislation, such as the Judiciary.  I wanted to make that clear, although it is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.</p><p>  The new section 2B is a necessary provision to provide alternative means to secure the necessary savings in the public service and pensions bill that we have set out.  We require &euro;300 million this year and &euro;1 billion by 2015, as we have said.  The overall ambition of the Government is to secure these savings by way of agreement, and that is why we spent five months in negotiations with all the public sector unions.  The proposed Haddington Road agreement is the fruit of that labour, negotiated freely between public service employers and public servants through the Labour Relations Commission.  Section 7 reflects that an increment freeze can be avoided through a collective agreement between public service employers and employees.  It is through the collective agreement provided under this process that the Haddington Road agreement can be implemented between parties.</p><p>  Section 2B is a limited contingency measure confined to confirming the existing powers to make changes to working time and remuneration other than basic pay, which is not being amended.  In practice, it will be exercised by a line Minister such as the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills and authorised by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Amendment No. 29 is inconsistent with the terms of the section and it cannot be accepted as it refers to a pay reduction.  It is also unnecessary, as implicit in the powers available under section 2B is the option to exercise the power for different employees or groups of employees differently.  I do not believe the existing provisions and powers relating to terms and conditions as modified and provided for in this section would benefit from being exercised by regulation rather than required under existing legislation.  For the information of the Deputy, the process will of course be in public and there is no question of a secret agreement being made.  If terms and conditions are to be changed, the workers directly involved would know and there is no reason for such a secret to be held.  There is no difficulty with that element of the Deputy's concern.</p><p>  Amendment No. 61 seeks to amend section 8, which provides a power for the Minister to exempt individual public servants or groups from the increment freeze on limited or exceptional grounds.  The amendment seeks that this power should be exercised by regulation rather than direction but given the limited power and the narrow legislative parameters in which it will be exercised as set out in the legislation, I am not persuaded that regulation rather than direction, with the attendant policies and principles as set out in the Bill, is required or appropriate.</p></speech>

The Minister knows that as part of the failed Croke Park II agreement, at least ten letters were issued by the Minister's Department and line management as letters of comfort to individual trade unions.  Those were never made public and although I asked the Minister to publish them, he told me it was not the normal practice.  When I tried to get them under the Freedom of Information Act, I was told that industrial relations processes are exempt from its auspices.</p><p>  The IMPACT union has in the past few days been showing members letters so it must have received a letter of comfort from somebody authorised by the Minister.  It would have dealt with the pensions of people who retire before the restoration of increments and there was an indication that it would be a matter for future Governments.  That is what has been stated, based on the letter issued to people by the union.  The Minister met representatives of the association of retired public servants yesterday and indicated that he sees the matter slightly differently, with a view based on resources.</p><p>  It seems there are letters out there as part of the Haddington Road draft agreement and neither the Oireachtas nor the public can access them.  They are letters issued in private and the Minister has confirmed that they will not be circulated.  I have asked parliamentary questions on making these available but the Minister has kept stonewalling by saying it is a long-standing process and they are only letters or clarification.  I want an assurance that agreements will be made public so that everybody can examine them.  It is not enough for the employees and the line Minister to know what is contained in them.  Will the Minister agree to remove the anomaly from the Freedom of Information Act when we come to it during the year?  Will the details of those agreements be made public?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.877" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900061#LLL00600"><p>Section 2B really cuts to the chase in what the Government is seeking to achieve with the legislation.  On the one hand it reconfirms the strategy of dividing and conquering public sector workers, although the Minister is aware that a trade union is seeking legal advice on the constitutionality of treating different workers in a different manner on the basis of trade union membership or otherwise.  The Minister referred to these as "contingency" measures in his Second Stage speech but if he already has the power to arbitrarily cut pay and increase hours, why would he feel it necessary to set that out in legislation?</p><p>  How can the Minister claim that this legislation respects the principles and practice of free, collective bargaining when he has presented us with the legislative instrument that gives him and his fellow Ministers the power to ride roughshod over that process?  It is not appropriate for the Minister to have powers to arbitrarily cut wages or increase hours and it is laughable for him to seek powers through this legislation while claiming that he respects the collective bargaining tradition of this State.  I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Howlin, would have had some commitment to that as a member of the Labour Party.</p><p>  The Minister indicated that this round of cuts will be the &quot;last ask&quot; of public servants but I wonder about that.  This legislation gives the Minister the capacity not just now but on a future occasion to cut and sideline if he so wishes the collective bargaining process, allowing him to intervene unilaterally and directly.  That is simply wrong and it is alarming, given the fact that the Minister's track record is to go after low and middle income workers, freeze and pause increments and increase working hours.</p></speech>

This section is the draconian heart of the Bill because it is essentially telling public sector workers that the Government will negotiate with them as long as there is agreement.  If the workers dare to disagree, the Government will inflict whatever it likes on them.</p><p>We are giving the power to the Minister to do this, making a mockery of negotiation with trade union members, undermining the basis of collective bargaining and moving in a very dangerous direction of dictatorial imposition of cuts in pay and conditions on working people.  It is very shameful that it is a Labour Party Minister who is doing this on the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out.  It truly is.  The Minister may not wish to believe this, but earlier I spoke to a trade unionist who described this as a legislative lock-out.  I cannot mention his name because he did not give me permission to do so, but he was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party.  This is how he described the Bill and he is absolutely right because this is what the Minister is doing.  He is fundamentally undermining the basis of negotiation between employers and employees and fundamentally undermining collective bargaining.  It is a serious attack on trade unionism and it is depressing in the extreme that the Labour Party would choose to do this.  The Minister and the Labour Party should be ashamed of themselves.</p></speech>

It is about giving draconian powers to the Government and future Governments to attack by fiat the conditions of trade unionists over their heads and making a mockery of the basic principles of trade unionism.</p></speech>

We can all throw blame back and forth with regard to messing in the process, but the Minister has been around long enough to know exactly what is going on with regard to stifling debate on this with the guillotine and the lack of a technical appendix.  The Minister is a student of history and political ideology.  He mentioned fascism several times earlier in the Chamber.  I am not saying we are anywhere near this, but this type of stifling leads this way and the Minister, as a student of these subjects, knows this.  He knows exactly what is going on.</p><p>  I do not have a problem with the target of &euro;300 million.  I appreciate the budget must be balanced.  It is not necessary under the troika because other savings have already achieved it.  We are coming well within the &euro;300 million but it probably should come out nonetheless.  However, this section, and the amendments I tabled which were ruled out of order, go to the heart of my problem with the legislation, which is that it targets public sector pay without targeting waste.  There is huge waste.  I spoke at the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors conference and put it to them their wages would have to fall if and when waste could be taken out first and if a plan could be put in place for people who this legislation will push into financial distress.  We know some people will be pushed into mortgage arrears and poverty because of this, but we have no technical appendix or poverty impact assessments so we do not know the numbers.  This legislation will impact hugely on people because inevitably it will apply to some workers in Ireland who will not be covered by the Haddington Road agreement.  My problem is that it goes after wages when there is a lot of waste to be taken.  Ultimately public sector wages must come in line with private sector wages; if we are to have a fair and equitable society workers should be paid the same amount.  I take no relish in the fact-----</p></speech>

If ultimately public sector wages must fall it should only be in the context of protections for those who get pushed into poverty and arrears.  It is unreasonable in my opinion to ask people to take cuts to their pay when there is so much waste which could be gone after first.</p><p>  The Minister keeps mentioning that 87% of the public sector earns less than &euro;65,000 and will not be hit.  Many of them will be hit.  The Garda Representative Association has calculated that a garda on &euro;35,000 will take a hit of several thousand euro because of the changes to premium payments.</p></speech>

I understand the pension is half of the final wage but if we are considering a reasonable wage or income at which people should take a hit there are two completely separate rules, one for people working and earning &euro;65,000 and one for people who have worked and are pensioners for whom the threshold is &euro;32,500.  This is utterly flawed in not tackling waste before having to go near wages.</p></speech>

The general secretary of the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, stated this is the first time a lecturer represented by IFUT and a lecturer represented by SIPTU could be on two different terms.  There is huge concern about this.</p><p>  The other issue of huge concern is with regard to the right to free collective bargaining which is supposed to be at the heart of the Labour Party and part of the programme for Government.  One cannot have free collective bargaining when one has a gun to one's head; it does not happen this way.  William Martin Murphy and the forerunners to IBEC put a gun to workers' heads to sign something.  This is exactly what is happening.  If one does not sign this, the legislation will be in place and it will be done anyway.  It is shameful for any member of the Labour Party to stand over this, particularly when card-carrying members say this.</p><p>  Serious incidents have occurred in our area where people have been threatened that if they do not hand over money to certain people their houses will be burned down.  The Minister is doing the same thing and it is absolutely out of order.  There will be resistance to it.  Giving Ministers powers which are not checked in the D&aacute;il is a very bad road to take.  This is a serious concern for the trade union movement.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming spoke about this not being about a collective agreement and this point was made by a number of other people.  Unlike Deputy Fleming's party I set out to fully inform the trade union movement and representatives of workers in the public sector of the exact financial parameters in which the State was operating to see whether they would co-operate in an agreement which would give us the savings we required.  We spent five months doing this, unlike Deputy Fleming's party which unilaterally decided to cut wages twice without let or hindrance or discussion with anybody.  This side of the House respects collective bargaining.  We respect the principles of trade unionism.  I ask Deputy Collins and others to respect trade unions and respect the people who spent five months at the table negotiating and the rights of these unions to make recommendations.  Some socialists in the House are so pure that anybody who does not agree with them is to be disregarded.</p></speech>

I respect the right of trade unions to come to their own independent decisions now, but I have set out fairly what the Government has to do.  It is in the full light of all those facts that individual trade unionists - who have a stake not only as public servants but also as people dependent on public services, and as taxpayers and citizens - will come to their own conclusions.  Let us respect that and not call them names or browbeat them, as some Deputies opposite have done.</p></speech>

This section is a contingency in the event of non-agreement.  That is what it is about.  It is also a useful, positive thing to have because powers exist to do these things, as I have said.   I want to put it beyond doubt, however, because there will be circumstances where the rights and conditions of workers have to be reaffirmed by Ministers, where workers move within the public service as happens now, and terms and conditions might not be legally certain.  This provision can be exercised in that regard to ensure that workers have their entitlements and rights preserved as they move across the public service in redeployment.  That is something I was alerted to and it is a useful provision to have in this legislation.</p></speech>

I have said clearly that it is a contingency in the event of non-agreement.  I have made no bones about this.  Where people, by their own democratic rights, determine that they do not want to be part of the Haddington Road agreement, we have to make savings.  We are not going to exempt people from making a contribution when others have signed up to do it.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming mentioned the letters issue.  There is a difference between the clarifications that were sought by some unions, and that is the content of the letters that we issued.  There were fewer than happened in previous agreements and it has never been the practice in agreements negotiated by Deputy Fleming's own government, going back to the beginning of social partnership, for those letters to be published.  I would have an open mind on it but I am told that it would be a new precedent.  I will reflect further on that if the Deputy is really animated about it, and we will come back to it on later when we have settled this particular set of matters.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald talked about the constitutionality of these provisions and referenced one particular trade union.  Every trade union, no less than any citizen, has the right to test the constitutionality of any provision enacted by these Houses.  Of course they are entitled to do that, but I depend on the advice of the Attorney General in bringing legislative matters before this House.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, or FEMPI, legislation has probably been challenged more in the courts than any set of legislative measures and it has proven to be remarkably resilient and robust.  It is the right of any individual to challenge it, however.</p><p>  Although there are a number of bilateral agreements with individual sectoral unions, I still hope that there will be a critical mass to have an overarching agreement with the public sector unions and with congress.  Therefore, this would ultimately be a congress agreement and there will be no exemptions from it and no contingencies required.  That would still be my hope but it is a matter for the democratic process.  That is what I would prefer to arrive at and it would be better for the public service generally than to have bilateral agreements with individual sectors or unions.  </p><p>  Deputy McDonald also referred to free collective bargaining, and I have already answered that question.  She also mentioned the &quot;last ask&quot; issue and she dealt with that.  In an earlier contribution, Deputy Fleming spoke about how far we had travelled on the road to recovery.  He is so impressed by how far we have travelled that he feels I need to convince him again that we actually have a financial emergency.  I think he half believes that we have escaped from it now, which is an interesting view.  We have travelled a long way from the disaster that this Government inherited, but we are not out of the woods yet.  We still a level of deficit that I instanced earlier and we are still borrowing at the rate of &euro;1 billion per month.  </p><p>  Once this particular set of measures is put in place, it is my absolute, firm intention that we will not be looking at public sector pay again for the duration of this Parliament and Government, and for the duration of this agreement.  I hope that the next negotiations that we embark upon with the public sector unions will be about undoing some of the difficult measures that have been enacted in FEMPI legislation and other measures.  We will therefore be talking about improvements in terms and conditions.  That is what I would like.  I think that is a reasonable expectation now because we have made so many difficult decisions.</p><p>  In reply to Deputy McDonald, I want to refer to the notion of low income.  It is unreasonable to categorise people in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum as being on low income.</p></speech>

I ask that they be done by way of regulation rather than agreement solely in the Labour Court or Labour Relations Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.955" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900062#LLL00200"><p>Inserting the new section 2B into the parent Act means that an existing power to fix terms and conditions may be exercised by the relevant employer or Minister of the Government so as to result in less favourable remuneration other than core salary, which is unaffected by the power, or in increased hours for the public servants concerned, notwithstanding any of the terms of any enactment, contract or otherwise provided for.  This provision will not apply to any group of public servants for whom remuneration is set by primary legislation, such as the Judiciary.  I wanted to make that clear, although it is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.</p><p>  The new section 2B is a necessary provision to provide alternative means to secure the necessary savings in the public service and pensions bill that we have set out.  We require &euro;300 million this year and &euro;1 billion by 2015, as we have said.  The overall ambition of the Government is to secure these savings by way of agreement, and that is why we spent five months in negotiations with all the public sector unions.  The proposed Haddington Road agreement is the fruit of that labour, negotiated freely between public service employers and public servants through the Labour Relations Commission.  Section 7 reflects that an increment freeze can be avoided through a collective agreement between public service employers and employees.  It is through the collective agreement provided under this process that the Haddington Road agreement can be implemented between parties.</p><p>  Section 2B is a limited contingency measure confined to confirming the existing powers to make changes to working time and remuneration other than basic pay, which is not being amended.  In practice, it will be exercised by a line Minister such as the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills and authorised by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Amendment No. 29 is inconsistent with the terms of the section and it cannot be accepted as it refers to a pay reduction.  It is also unnecessary, as implicit in the powers available under section 2B is the option to exercise the power for different employees or groups of employees differently.  I do not believe the existing provisions and powers relating to terms and conditions as modified and provided for in this section would benefit from being exercised by regulation rather than required under existing legislation.  For the information of the Deputy, the process will of course be in public and there is no question of a secret agreement being made.  If terms and conditions are to be changed, the workers directly involved would know and there is no reason for such a secret to be held.  There is no difficulty with that element of the Deputy's concern.</p><p>  Amendment No. 61 seeks to amend section 8, which provides a power for the Minister to exempt individual public servants or groups from the increment freeze on limited or exceptional grounds.  The amendment seeks that this power should be exercised by regulation rather than direction but given the limited power and the narrow legislative parameters in which it will be exercised as set out in the legislation, I am not persuaded that regulation rather than direction, with the attendant policies and principles as set out in the Bill, is required or appropriate.</p></speech>

The Minister knows that as part of the failed Croke Park II agreement, at least ten letters were issued by the Minister's Department and line management as letters of comfort to individual trade unions.  Those were never made public and although I asked the Minister to publish them, he told me it was not the normal practice.  When I tried to get them under the Freedom of Information Act, I was told that industrial relations processes are exempt from its auspices.</p><p>  The IMPACT union has in the past few days been showing members letters so it must have received a letter of comfort from somebody authorised by the Minister.  It would have dealt with the pensions of people who retire before the restoration of increments and there was an indication that it would be a matter for future Governments.  That is what has been stated, based on the letter issued to people by the union.  The Minister met representatives of the association of retired public servants yesterday and indicated that he sees the matter slightly differently, with a view based on resources.</p><p>  It seems there are letters out there as part of the Haddington Road draft agreement and neither the Oireachtas nor the public can access them.  They are letters issued in private and the Minister has confirmed that they will not be circulated.  I have asked parliamentary questions on making these available but the Minister has kept stonewalling by saying it is a long-standing process and they are only letters or clarification.  I want an assurance that agreements will be made public so that everybody can examine them.  It is not enough for the employees and the line Minister to know what is contained in them.  Will the Minister agree to remove the anomaly from the Freedom of Information Act when we come to it during the year?  Will the details of those agreements be made public?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-05-29a.959" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900062#LLL00600"><p>Section 2B really cuts to the chase in what the Government is seeking to achieve with the legislation.  On the one hand it reconfirms the strategy of dividing and conquering public sector workers, although the Minister is aware that a trade union is seeking legal advice on the constitutionality of treating different workers in a different manner on the basis of trade union membership or otherwise.  The Minister referred to these as "contingency" measures in his Second Stage speech but if he already has the power to arbitrarily cut pay and increase hours, why would he feel it necessary to set that out in legislation?</p><p>  How can the Minister claim that this legislation respects the principles and practice of free, collective bargaining when he has presented us with the legislative instrument that gives him and his fellow Ministers the power to ride roughshod over that process?  It is not appropriate for the Minister to have powers to arbitrarily cut wages or increase hours and it is laughable for him to seek powers through this legislation while claiming that he respects the collective bargaining tradition of this State.  I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Howlin, would have had some commitment to that as a member of the Labour Party.</p><p>  The Minister indicated that this round of cuts will be the &quot;last ask&quot; of public servants but I wonder about that.  This legislation gives the Minister the capacity not just now but on a future occasion to cut and sideline if he so wishes the collective bargaining process, allowing him to intervene unilaterally and directly.  That is simply wrong and it is alarming, given the fact that the Minister's track record is to go after low and middle income workers, freeze and pause increments and increase working hours.</p></speech>

This section is the draconian heart of the Bill because it is essentially telling public sector workers that the Government will negotiate with them as long as there is agreement.  If the workers dare to disagree, the Government will inflict whatever it likes on them.</p><p>We are giving the power to the Minister to do this, making a mockery of negotiation with trade union members, undermining the basis of collective bargaining and moving in a very dangerous direction of dictatorial imposition of cuts in pay and conditions on working people.  It is very shameful that it is a Labour Party Minister who is doing this on the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out.  It truly is.  The Minister may not wish to believe this, but earlier I spoke to a trade unionist who described this as a legislative lock-out.  I cannot mention his name because he did not give me permission to do so, but he was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party.  This is how he described the Bill and he is absolutely right because this is what the Minister is doing.  He is fundamentally undermining the basis of negotiation between employers and employees and fundamentally undermining collective bargaining.  It is a serious attack on trade unionism and it is depressing in the extreme that the Labour Party would choose to do this.  The Minister and the Labour Party should be ashamed of themselves.</p></speech>

We can all throw blame back and forth with regard to messing in the process, but the Minister has been around long enough to know exactly what is going on with regard to stifling debate on this with the guillotine and the lack of a technical appendix.  The Minister is a student of history and political ideology.  He mentioned fascism several times earlier in the Chamber.  I am not saying we are anywhere near this, but this type of stifling leads this way and the Minister, as a student of these subjects, knows this.  He knows exactly what is going on.</p><p>  I do not have a problem with the target of &euro;300 million.  I appreciate the budget must be balanced.  It is not necessary under the troika because other savings have already achieved it.  We are coming well within the &euro;300 million but it probably should come out nonetheless.  However, this section, and the amendments I tabled which were ruled out of order, go to the heart of my problem with the legislation, which is that it targets public sector pay without targeting waste.  There is huge waste.  I spoke at the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors conference and put it to them their wages would have to fall if and when waste could be taken out first and if a plan could be put in place for people who this legislation will push into financial distress.  We know some people will be pushed into mortgage arrears and poverty because of this, but we have no technical appendix or poverty impact assessments so we do not know the numbers.  This legislation will impact hugely on people because inevitably it will apply to some workers in Ireland who will not be covered by the Haddington Road agreement.  My problem is that it goes after wages when there is a lot of waste to be taken.  Ultimately public sector wages must come in line with private sector wages; if we are to have a fair and equitable society workers should be paid the same amount.  I take no relish in the fact-----</p></speech>

If ultimately public sector wages must fall it should only be in the context of protections for those who get pushed into poverty and arrears.  It is unreasonable in my opinion to ask people to take cuts to their pay when there is so much waste which could be gone after first.</p><p>  The Minister keeps mentioning that 87% of the public sector earns less than &euro;65,000 and will not be hit.  Many of them will be hit.  The Garda Representative Association has calculated that a garda on &euro;35,000 will take a hit of several thousand euro because of the changes to premium payments.</p></speech>

I understand the pension is half of the final wage but if we are considering a reasonable wage or income at which people should take a hit there are two completely separate rules, one for people working and earning &euro;65,000 and one for people who have worked and are pensioners for whom the threshold is &euro;32,500.  This is utterly flawed in not tackling waste before having to go near wages.</p></speech>

The general secretary of the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, stated this is the first time a lecturer represented by IFUT and a lecturer represented by SIPTU could be on two different terms.  There is huge concern about this.</p><p>  The other issue of huge concern is with regard to the right to free collective bargaining which is supposed to be at the heart of the Labour Party and part of the programme for Government.  One cannot have free collective bargaining when one has a gun to one's head; it does not happen this way.  William Martin Murphy and the forerunners to IBEC put a gun to workers' heads to sign something.  This is exactly what is happening.  If one does not sign this, the legislation will be in place and it will be done anyway.  It is shameful for any member of the Labour Party to stand over this, particularly when card-carrying members say this.</p><p>  Serious incidents have occurred in our area where people have been threatened that if they do not hand over money to certain people their houses will be burned down.  The Minister is doing the same thing and it is absolutely out of order.  There will be resistance to it.  Giving Ministers powers which are not checked in the D&aacute;il is a very bad road to take.  This is a serious concern for the trade union movement.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming spoke about this not being about a collective agreement and this point was made by a number of other people.  Unlike Deputy Fleming's party I set out to fully inform the trade union movement and representatives of workers in the public sector of the exact financial parameters in which the State was operating to see whether they would co-operate in an agreement which would give us the savings we required.  We spent five months doing this, unlike Deputy Fleming's party which unilaterally decided to cut wages twice without let or hindrance or discussion with anybody.  This side of the House respects collective bargaining.  We respect the principles of trade unionism.  I ask Deputy Collins and others to respect trade unions and respect the people who spent five months at the table negotiating and the rights of these unions to make recommendations.  Some socialists in the House are so pure that anybody who does not agree with them is to be disregarded.</p></speech>

I respect the right of trade unions to come to their own independent decisions now, but I have set out fairly what the Government has to do.  It is in the full light of all those facts that individual trade unionists - who have a stake not only as public servants but also as people dependent on public services, and as taxpayers and citizens - will come to their own conclusions.  Let us respect that and not call them names or browbeat them, as some Deputies opposite have done.</p></speech>

This section is a contingency in the event of non-agreement.  That is what it is about.  It is also a useful, positive thing to have because powers exist to do these things, as I have said.   I want to put it beyond doubt, however, because there will be circumstances where the rights and conditions of workers have to be reaffirmed by Ministers, where workers move within the public service as happens now, and terms and conditions might not be legally certain.  This provision can be exercised in that regard to ensure that workers have their entitlements and rights preserved as they move across the public service in redeployment.  That is something I was alerted to and it is a useful provision to have in this legislation.</p></speech>

I have said clearly that it is a contingency in the event of non-agreement.  I have made no bones about this.  Where people, by their own democratic rights, determine that they do not want to be part of the Haddington Road agreement, we have to make savings.  We are not going to exempt people from making a contribution when others have signed up to do it.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming mentioned the letters issue.  There is a difference between the clarifications that were sought by some unions, and that is the content of the letters that we issued.  There were fewer than happened in previous agreements and it has never been the practice in agreements negotiated by Deputy Fleming's own government, going back to the beginning of social partnership, for those letters to be published.  I would have an open mind on it but I am told that it would be a new precedent.  I will reflect further on that if the Deputy is really animated about it, and we will come back to it on later when we have settled this particular set of matters.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald talked about the constitutionality of these provisions and referenced one particular trade union.  Every trade union, no less than any citizen, has the right to test the constitutionality of any provision enacted by these Houses.  Of course they are entitled to do that, but I depend on the advice of the Attorney General in bringing legislative matters before this House.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, or FEMPI, legislation has probably been challenged more in the courts than any set of legislative measures and it has proven to be remarkably resilient and robust.  It is the right of any individual to challenge it, however.</p><p>  Although there are a number of bilateral agreements with individual sectoral unions, I still hope that there will be a critical mass to have an overarching agreement with the public sector unions and with congress.  Therefore, this would ultimately be a congress agreement and there will be no exemptions from it and no contingencies required.  That would still be my hope but it is a matter for the democratic process.  That is what I would prefer to arrive at and it would be better for the public service generally than to have bilateral agreements with individual sectors or unions.  </p><p>  Deputy McDonald also referred to free collective bargaining, and I have already answered that question.  She also mentioned the &quot;last ask&quot; issue and she dealt with that.  In an earlier contribution, Deputy Fleming spoke about how far we had travelled on the road to recovery.  He is so impressed by how far we have travelled that he feels I need to convince him again that we actually have a financial emergency.  I think he half believes that we have escaped from it now, which is an interesting view.  We have travelled a long way from the disaster that this Government inherited, but we are not out of the woods yet.  We still a level of deficit that I instanced earlier and we are still borrowing at the rate of &euro;1 billion per month.  </p><p>  Once this particular set of measures is put in place, it is my absolute, firm intention that we will not be looking at public sector pay again for the duration of this Parliament and Government, and for the duration of this agreement.  I hope that the next negotiations that we embark upon with the public sector unions will be about undoing some of the difficult measures that have been enacted in FEMPI legislation and other measures.  We will therefore be talking about improvements in terms and conditions.  That is what I would like.  I think that is a reasonable expectation now because we have made so many difficult decisions.</p><p>  In reply to Deputy McDonald, I want to refer to the notion of low income.  It is unreasonable to categorise people in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum as being on low income.</p></speech>

This is a reasonable set of measures.  Deputy Donnelly talked about waste but in all honesty the whole notion that we will not have to cut anybody's wages is a cop-out.

I would be happy to give the Deputy chapter and verse on it.
