This is occurring for a combination of reasons, including the cutbacks of recent years and a major issue with retention and recruitment of nursing staff, psychologists and psychiatrists.  There has clearly been a lack of strategic planning on the human resources side for some time.  This is having a significant and damaging impact on people with mental health issues, particularly children.  Across the country, it has never been as difficult to access mental health services.  One example, which was brought to the Taoiseach's attention by Deputy James Browne, was that of people being treated on chairs in corridors in Waterford.  In that case, it involved a young 16 year old in an adult ward.</p><p>A case has been brought to my attention by another Deputy concerning the hinterlands of Dublin where a patient presented at an emergency department with a general practitioner's letter saying that he was suicidal.  He was simply put on anti-depressants and discharged without admission.</p> <p> There are bed shortages and staff shortages and the situation is becoming alarming, as illustrated by the news that the Linn Dara child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, inpatient unit, a children's mental health facility in Cherry Orchard, is closing 11 of its 22 beds from Friday next for the summer due to staff shortages.  We have had correspondence, including emails, from parents of patients at Linn Dara who are under enormous pressure.  Children who were admitted two weeks ago as being in emergency situations, at high risk and in need of emergency admission are now being discharged early.  As parents have asked us, where are they to go next Friday?  Why is the HSE saying that the facility will re-open in September?  It does not add up that there will be shortages in June but they will be sorted in September.</p> <p> While there are meant to be 100 child and adolescent beds, there are 63 at present and that will decrease to 52 with what is happening at Cherry Orchard.  Deputies across the House are dealing with cases of children, relating in particular to CAMHS, who are on waiting lists for appointments to see psychologists, get access or get assessed.  It is time for urgent intervention.  That will necessitate using capacity other than public capacity.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach intervene to keep the 11 beds in Linn Dara open?  I ask him to do so.  Will the Government show urgency regarding the retention of staff and the recruitment of additional staff?  I do not like saying this but the service is essentially not holding together.  It is falling apart at the seams and there are problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052300004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I do not accept that it is falling apart at the seams.  I had a meeting with the Deputy, Deputy Browne and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, just last week where we discussed all of this.  Funding for mental health, as Deputy Martin knows, has gone up from &euro;826 million last year to &euro;853 million this year, 2017.  Over 160 additional posts have been recruited for the HSE mental health area over January to March this year.  Recruitment campaigns are carried out to fill further vacancies and they are under way.  Sanction has been given and money provided to recruit 114 assistant psychologists to enhance the early intervention primary care counselling services for under-18s in particular and to relieve pressure on the specialist CAMH service.  The development of a plan for a 7-7 mental health care improvement nationally has been progressed and is nearing completion.  It has prioritised that all areas provide access to a weekend service for current service users and not have situations where nobody has access to a service if he or she needs it.  A full mapping exercise is being carried out countrywide.  The HSE, at present, is consulting with all of the personnel in the health sector area and assessing the resource implications to develop costed actions.  In addition, of course, the construction of the new 120-bed hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum after over a century, along with a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit and a new ten-bed mental health intellectual disability unit, has been advanced.  The Minister expects to sign that contract very shortly.  Award of the construction contract is due to happen quite quickly.  It has been recently agreed that in addition, the contract will also include a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.</p>  <p>  These are all positive signs of progress in an area that was neglected for so many years and was, over 30 years, the Cinderella of many Health Service Executive Votes and Department of Health Votes.  When former Deputy Dan Neville was in opposition on that side of the House, he raised this matter consistently.  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is making valiant efforts to deal with this.</p>  <p>  Funding for this area includes youth mental health, improvement of the CAMHS and the adult services, services for older people, out-of-hours services, enhanced service user and carer engagement, perinatal mental health, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, in adults and children, dual diagnosis of those with mental health and substance abuse issues, increased services to meet the needs of those with severe and enduring mental illness with complex presentations and improved specialist clinical responses through clinical programmes.</p><p> Deputy Martin raised a specific case in respect of 11 beds.  I do not have the details of that here, but I will undertake to follow up on that for him.  I know it is an issue of concern locally, and Deputy Browne might have referred to that.  Believe me, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is working very hard in this area.  The improvements I have outlined are long overdue and it is hoped they will make a significant improvement for the health, in particular the mental health, of children and young adults.</p></speech>

Where are those children going to go?  That is the question I asked the Taoiseach.  No one has an answer.  These are children who were admitted in an emergency and they are at high risk.  Every Deputy knows this.  I have a list of CAMHS cases in my office and I have no doubt other Deputies do also.  These are children in severe need of assessment, intervention, treatment and admission but it is simply not happening for them.  The anxiety, stress and strain on the parents is unbelievable and unacceptable.  It is inhumane.</p></speech>

First, intensive efforts are under way to maintain the services at Linn Dara CAMHS unit at Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is in regular and very close contact with the HSE in regard to the particular difficulties of providing adequate staffing, and meetings are under way this very afternoon.  Clearly, however, there are staffing difficulties at this facility.  At present, the unit is reliant on providing cover through methods such as staff working additional hours, overtime and agency staff.  However, the core issue facing Linn Dara at present relates specifically to staff recruitment difficulties for mental health professionals.  I pointed out to the Deputy that 160 have been recruited from January to March this year and an additional 114 assistant psychologists have been approved and are now under recruitment.</p>  <p>  Let me clear this up for Deputy Martin.  The problem facing Linn Dara does not relate to funding availability or the restructuring of any of the CAMHS services.</p></speech>

No individual will be discharged to close beds.  Let us be clear about that.  The HSE is actively engaged in a recruitment process for Linn Dara and is meeting this afternoon.  It is exploring every option to ensure this excellent service remains fully operational.</p></speech>

Incidentally, Fianna F&aacute;il abstained on a Sinn F&eacute;in motion to provide 24-7 mental health provision.</p><p>On Friday, along with my colleague, an Teachta Munster, I visited the department of psychiatry acute inpatient unit in Drogheda.  This is a world-class, state-of-the-art facility.  I commend everyone, including the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on bringing it to fruition.  The purpose of this unit is to assist citizens from counties Louth and Meath who present with acute mental health problems.  They receive treatment and therapy for a short time - usually about two weeks.  They are then discharged to the community mental health staff for follow-up care.  In Drogheda, the Singleton House facility provides individual patient treatment but there is no day hospital for ongoing treatment and recovery.<br/><br/>A Vision for Change places a strong emphasis on community-based psychiatric services but in north Louth, these are practically non-existent.  In Dundalk, the picture is particularly grim.  In north Louth, all HSE mental health provision is delivered from a 60-year old building at the Ladywell centre in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, which the Taoiseach should visit.  Against all the odds the mental health providers do great work, but because of issues of damp and lack of suitable space, much of the Ladywell centre is unsuitable.  That means there is no child and adolescent mental health provision and no psychiatry of old age in north Louth.  After considerable lobbying, additional staff members were allocated to the area, which I welcome, but there is no accommodation for them in Dundalk.  Therefore they cannot even be in the place that needs them.  Instead patients travel to Ardee or Drogheda, which is totally unacceptable.<br/><br/>There is a long-standing promise of a primary care centre with a facility for community mental health for Dundalk.  However, that promise is worthless.  There is no start date, no definition and no real commitment.  Sometimes this promise is used as an excuse to refuse to upgrade the Ladywell centre.  They are stuck in this decrepit building that is not fit for purpose.  They are told it cannot be upgraded because a primary care centre is due.  There is no definition of when that might be.  The choice is quite simple.

As I am sure the Taoiseach knows, there are areas in Dundalk that are highly deprived.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene on two counts.  Will he intervene to ensure that citizens in north Louth get the facilities they deserve?  Will he intervene to prevent the closure of the 11 child and adolescent mental health beds at the Linn Dara facility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-23a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052300006#D00400"><p>I have already referred to the Linn Dara situation where a meeting is taking place this afternoon.  Sanction has been given for the recruitment of personnel already from January to March this year, including a further 114 assistant clinical psychologists.  The difficulty with the Linn Dara facility is not funding but is a question of staffing difficulties.  Serious efforts are being made today on a continuing basis to deal with that matter.  I hope it can be dealt with conclusively and positively.  It is not a case of the usual claim of a shortage of money.  Some 1,100 new posts have been provided for mental health and sanctioned and filled between 2012 and 2016.  There was additional substantial funding of more than &euro;115 million.  Budget 2017 provided further additional funding for mental health, which means that the HSE funding for this key care programme will increase from &euro;826 million in 2016 to more than &euro;850 million this year.</p>  <p>  In budget 2017, an additional &euro;35 million was allocated for services to be initiated in 2017.  The Deputy is talking about north Louth, which, no more than any other part of the country, still has inadequate services.  The range of what I have outlined, which is of particular to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to dealing with this.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned A Vision for Change.  A review of the 2001 Act is under way.</p><p>As I mentioned to the Deputy last week, some points made by Deputy Browne are being taken into account.  In line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Department recently commenced a policy review of A Vision for Change.  This began with the evidence-based expert review of international best practice and existing service development.  The latter was completed in February of this year and it will inform the next stage of a policy review process and that will take into account the review of the Mental Health Act.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, chairs a task force that comprises a diverse group of 18 people from a number of different mental health sectors - public, private, community and voluntary.  The task force has a balance of age, gender and diversity and is an action-focused group which has been meeting monthly over the past year.  As part of the Minister of State's commitment to ensuring that the voices of children and young people are at the very heart of the work of the task force, a series of consultations with young people themselves has now commenced.  The task force and the public consultation process organised by the Minister of State are very active.  The detail of what the Deputy referred to in north Louth is a matter on which I can follow up.  The overall picture is one of increasing funding and approval, sanction and recruitment of qualified staff to provide the best level of service for children and young people on a 7-7 basis so that nobody is left without attention when they need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-23a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052300007#E00200"><p>I will repeat what I said, namely, that there is no child or adolescent mental health provision and no psychiatry of old age in north Louth.  Is that acceptable?  It cannot be acceptable.  There is no adequate facility.  There is a decrepit building which cannot even accommodate the extra staff that were brought into the area.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned A Vision for Change.  It contained a recommendation to the effect that the proportion of the total health budget allocated to mental health should be progressively increased to 8.24%.  Even that would be below international standards but it has never been realised.  The lack of capital investment in mental health services in County Louth has resulted in completely inadequate facilities.  How can a parent bring a child with depression 60 km from Carlingford to Drogheda for an appointment on, for example, public transport, which the Government is cutting back also?  Why should an older person with perhaps a lifelong history of mental health difficulties be expected to travel 50 km from Omeath to services in Ardee?  How can mental health providers be expected to do their job if they cannot even get a desk in Dundalk?  When will an appropriate building be provided for mental health services in north Louth so that citizens can access essential and life-saving services?</p></speech>

What is acceptable, however, is the fact that the budget has increased from &euro;826 million to &euro;853 million for this year.  What is acceptable is that 1,100 posts have been filled since 2011.  What is acceptable is that 160 additional posts have been recruited and filled between January and March of this year and that recruitment campaigns are currently under way and being followed through diligently.  What is acceptable is that sanction has been given for an additional 114 assistant psychologists to enhance early intervention primary care counselling services for those under 18 years of age in particular.  What is acceptable is the development of a plan to improve 7-7 mental health care nationally.  That has been progressed and is nearing completion.  What is acceptable is that this has prioritised all areas and should be in a position to provide access to a weekend service for current service users, including those in north Louth and many other areas throughout the country.  What is acceptable is that a full mapping exercise has been carried out.  The HSE is consulting all health sector personnel and assessing the resource implications in order to develop costed actions.</p>  <p>  I will follow up in respect of the particular issue Deputy Adams mentioned in north Louth but, overall, this was a Cinderella sector of society where there was not a voice to carry it forward.  It is evident that this matter is now, and will continue to be, a central priority of the Government.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is doing very diligent work in this area and it is proving to be progressive.  It is not yet there, by any means, in terms of it being a world-class standard but it is a very significant improvement indeed on what was left lying in isolation for so many years.</p></speech>

According to the hospital manager, they have been unable to de-escalate the protocol given the persistent and chronically high numbers of patients on trolleys.  I thank and praise the front-line staff of doctors and nurses and everyone else there.</p>  <p>  There are recent and totally unexpected ward closures in the area.  Some 18 step-down and rehab beds will be going this Friday in the wonderful geriatric unit at St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel.  The Sacred Heart unit at Dungarvan Community Hospital, which also is an excellent facility, will lose 11 rehab beds, three long-term beds and three step-down beds.  This is just increasing the concerns of the staff and families of the patients in those facilities in the county and in west Waterford.</p>  <p>  One measure that has been successful in addressing the problems of chronic overcrowding and long delays in our accident and emergency departments has been the introduction of ultrasound diagnostics in local primary care centres.  In January 2017 the community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 5 implemented a short-term initiative whereby GPs could directly refer adult medical card and GP visit card holders for X-ray and ultrasound services to a number of identified providers.  They are operating successfully in Limerick, Cork and Kerry but there is something wrong that we cannot do it in County Tipperary.  This was supposed to be a short-term emergency measure, designed to relieve pressure on hospitals in the immediate post-Christmas period.</p>  <p>  The Mary Street Medical Centre in Clonmel is an excellent health care facility and primary care centre that been attempting to implement the use of ultrasound diagnostics to help patients receive treatment faster.  In February of this year, after a lot of hard work, examinations and visits from HSE senior personnel, it was awarded a contract by the HSE to carry out such diagnostics.  Astonishingly, this contract was only for the duration of 14 days and was subsequently withdrawn after just ten days.  It must have been the shortest contract in the history of the HSE.  This is despite the fact that they carried out 35 scans in the seven working days making earlier diagnosis possible, which benefitted patients, and preventing referrals to the overcrowded accident and emergency department in South Tipperary General Hospital.  Patients and doctors alike praised the service but the HSE has refused to extend the contract, in spite of the detailed analysis of the success of the measure.</p>  <p>  One patient who was helped by this ultrasound service was a lady who was diagnosed with a tumour in her womb but who thankfully, has since had surgery to treat it.  If she had to experience the 12-month delay for ultrasound in the public system, this lady&rsquo;s outcome would have undoubtedly been far worse.  This lady is a General Medical Services patient and would otherwise have had to pay for a scan, which she probably could not afford.</p>  <p> I hate waving things to the Taoiseach on his long good-bye, and I wish him well, but there is a lovely picture of the Taoiseach on billboards all over the State where he said he would end the scandal of patients on trolleys.  Is the Taoiseach able to sleep at night when he thinks of this?  I ask the Taoiseach to direct the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris - if he will not do it himself - to continue this wonderful service or to at least give it a three-month trial period to see how successful it was.  There were 35 patients done in 11 days.  The Minister is not here.  T&aacute; s&eacute; as l&aacute;thair.  He is on the road working hard, but he should be here dealing with these issues.</p></speech>

This was a service that had a proven ability to deliver and to alleviate the crisis.  It is a wonderful health centre that had made the investment.

The theory is that people will be able to go to primary care centres to have medical needs which do not require treatment in accident and emergency departments dealt with and that this will help to reduce overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  When primary care centres are up and running they are required to be staffed and to have GPs available.  There is little point in building them if they are going to be closed at 5 p.m..  The theory is that a person should be able to go to a primary care centre on a 24-hour basis, as is the case in so many other countries.  This issue forms part of the discussions which the Minister for Health is having with the GPs in terms of their contracts and the types of facilities that they require in primary care centres.</p>  <p>  According to the HSE TrolleyGAR system this morning,  there were 331 patients on trolleys in acute hospitals nationally.  While this causes distress to patients, their families and to front-line services, the recent data indicates that the national situation is improving, with approximately 5% fewer patients waiting on trolleys at the end of April this year as compared with the same period last year.  Notwithstanding this improvement, these figures are still too high and the Department is working assiduously with the HSE to identify measures to reduce overcrowding in our hospitals and to provide key improvement measures that will continue to reduce trolley numbers and improve patient experience.  Several hospitals were under pressure this morning, including the Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, Letterkenny General Hospital and University Hospital Waterford.  Lessons have been learned over the last number of years.  The winter initiative introduced in an effort to reduce emergency department overcrowding, in respect of which an additional &euro;40 million was provided, brought about an improvement.  Lessons have been learned from that and will be implemented into the future.  A range of practical measures were included in that initiative, including: the provision of 90 additional beds; aids and appliances for approximately 5,000 patients; 1,000 additional home care packages; and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals.</p>  <p>  In regard to the particular issue raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath, I will ask the Minister to follow up on the matter for him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-23a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052300009#G00600"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  If I did mention the word "insanity", I did not mean to do so.  However, what is going on in the HSE is definitely bordering on insanity.  It is proposed to close two facilities, one in Cashel, which is north of Clonmel, and another in Dungarvan, which is south of Clonmel.  Both are excellent care facilities.  The Taoiseach's spiel of announcements is all waffle.  We know from the National Association of General Practitioners conference held at the weekend that local GP services nationwide are at crisis point and on the verge of collapse.  FEMPI cuts of up to 38% and the massive number of GPs emigrating are having an impact.</p>  <p>  On the Taoiseach's point that the primary care centres will have to be open 24-7, the facility I am speaking about was not allowed to that when it had a contract, albeit it was only a 14-day contract.   That contract was withdrawn after eight days despite the huge success of the facility in terms of reducing pressure on the local accident and emergency service.  If that was not an insane decision, then I do not know what it was.  According to expert analysis, the facility provided expert treatment services.  Having recruited additional GPs and staff who were told on a Friday evening that they were to start work the following Monday, the contract was withdrawn.  That is a waste of money and resources.</p>  <p>  The Mary Street Medical Centre is a wonderful facility.  Other facilities in Clonmel have invested hugely in equipment to enable them provide diagnostic services.  These services could help to reduce overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, provide people with quicker access to results, thereby reducing long-term damage to people's health, result in huge savings to the State and, also, reduce stress on families.  The HSE is confused.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to allow this centre a three-month trial of operation?  There are similar services in Limerick, Cork and Kerry and they are operating successfully.  What is wrong with Tipperary?  It is the biggest inland town in the country with, consistently, the highest number of people on trolleys at South Tipperary General Hospital, better known as St. Joseph's hospital.  The Mary Street Medical Centre can provide this service.  We need to allow the people in the primary care centres to do their work without having one hand tied behind their backs.  These people want to do the work and they are able to do it.  They are professionals who have invested and they have all the staff required to carry out the service.</p></speech>

The Disability Act 2005 provides for an assessment of the health and education needs of person with disabilities and provides for services to meet those needs.  Section 9(5) provides that the executive shall cause an assessment of applicants to be commenced within three months of the date of receipt of an application.  The background information and supporting documentation refer to the need for services to be provided early in life in order to ameliorate a disability.  The Act provides that the assessments must be started within three months of the application and that the HSE must complete the assessment within three months.  That is a legal requirement on the HSE as set out in the legislation.  Unfortunately, that is not the situation that obtains nationwide.  The legal entitlement of children with a disability is being breached routinely by the HSE.  Children are not being assessed within the three-month period and there are huge delays in assessment.  The service is broken and there must be an immediate solution to the problem.</p>  <p>  The current situation for children in terms of assessment of needs is totally unacceptable and I will give a few examples.  A child was referred for assessment on 8 September 2016 but a letter from the HSE states that the child is currently scheduled for assessment in September 2018.  Another was referred for assessment on 19 January 2017 but the HSE letter indicates that the waiting time for assessment is approximately 24 months.  A third child was referred in January 2017 and was told by the HSE that the assessment would commence in April 2019, a full 27 months away.  This is simply not good enough.  That child is now over three years old and will be over five years old in two years' time.</p>  <p>  Early intervention is absolutely crucial in order to ensure that children with disabilities are properly looked after and have services provided for them.  Vulnerable children with disabilities are being mistreated by the HSE and are being denied their legal rights.  Does the Taoiseach condone the routine breach of the law by a State agency, namely, the HSE?  What does he propose to do about it?  Will he instruct the HSE to abide by the law and ensure that every child is assessed in accordance with the law?</p></speech>

The Government has prioritised disability by appointing Deputy Finian McGrath as Minister of State at the Department of Health to sit at the Cabinet table and articulate the concerns and anxieties relating to this area on a regular basis.  Disability funding has increased over the past year and early intervention services and services for school-age children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively.  This process is well under way and the HSE is engaged in reconfiguring its therapy resources into geographically-based teams for children aged from birth to 18.  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide a single, clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of the disability they have, where they live or the school they attend, as evidence shows that is an important element of progress.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014-2015 in order to provide 200 additional posts to support the implementation of that model.  A further &euro;4 million in additional funding was allocated in respect of 75 therapy posts in 2016 and it is expected that, as this reconfiguration of services takes place, it will have a significant impact on the HSE's ability to meet the needs of children and young people in a much more efficient, effective and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  In 2013, 260 front-line primary care staff positions were approved.</p><p>That included 52 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists.  The aim is for that recruitment to continue which will lead to a reduction in waiting lists and times. A further &euro;4 million was provided in that regard in 2014.</p> <p> Since the June 2007 commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, the HSE has endeavoured to meet its legislative requirements as specifically referred to by Deputy Healy.  The number of applications for assessment under the Act has increased each year since it was introduced.  It is anticipated that in excess of 6,000 applications will be received this year.  It can take a significant period to determine accurately the nature of a disability which a child might have.  Although there has been continual investment in this area, there are significant challenges in meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment of the needs process.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, is dealing with the delay in assessments.  He is trying to resolve those delays by direct consultation.  There is an ongoing recruitment campaign to combat the issue of staff shortage.  The Minister of State is working with the HSE to deal with this in order that the requirements of the Act can be met by the HSE and there are no delays beyond the period for assessment and determination of a disability.</p></speech>

The HSE, which is a State agency, is breaking the law.  I asked the Taoiseach if he condones that and if he will ensure that does not happen in the future.  Unfortunately, since this Government has come to power and Deputy Finian McGrath has taken responsibility for the issue, the position has disimproved.  We have gone from a situation where there was reasonable compliance with the law to one where we now have a waiting time of two years for the commencement of an assessment.  The situation is being ignored.  It has been raised in this House by several Deputies through parliamentary questions and as a Topical Issue matter.  It has been ignored.  The Taoiseach's answer indicates that it is still being ignored.  The current situation is that where an assessment of need has not been completed, there are consequent delays in the provision of children's services such as speech and language therapy and the appointment of special needs assistants and resource teachers.  The inaction of the HSE is unacceptable, deplorable and illegal.  Does the Taoiseach condone that illegality and what he will do to ensure the HSE abides by the law?</p></speech>

The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, who has special responsibility for disability issues, sits at the Cabinet table, has a substantial budget and is working assiduously to deal with this issue.  If there are 6,000 assessments to be carried out this year, more than 100 must take place each week.  Many of these assessments are quite complex and take a period of time to assess accurately.</p></speech>

That is facilitated by the cross-sectoral team and the implementation of the Disability Act.  That team comprises representatives of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the HSE executive, the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service.  As Deputy Healy is aware, a detailed report was compiled by Mr. Eamon Stack, chairman of the National Council for Special Education, which sets out a progressive way of dealing with the issue.  While waiting lists are unacceptable and should not exist, the Minister of State is at the forefront of dealing with the delays.  In the near future, it is hoped the law in terms of assessment for children will be fully complied with, unlike the current situation where children have to wait for longer than they should.</p></speech>

Last night's bombing, which was in effect a barbaric attack on children, was an assault on civilization as we know it.  There is no hierarchy to suffering, horror and despair, but the fact that so many young people were killed and injured in this dreadful attack made it all the more appalling.  These were young people enjoying their night out, just as our own children do.  All our thoughts are with the people of Manchester and the families of the dead and injured, and we extend our solidarity to our colleagues in Westminster.  I have this morning communicated that solidarity to my colleague, Mr. John Bercow.  I say to the Members here that tonight, we in Ireland will hold our own children even closer.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Government and, while the President is away, all of the people of Ireland I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the people of Great Britain on the dreadful attack which took place in Manchester last night.  The atrocity is made all the more appalling by its deliberate targeting of young people and families, the targeting of innocence and enjoyment, as they began to make their way home from the Manchester Arena.  For those who have had the opportunity, and indeed privilege, of bringing their children to a concert like this, the excitement goes on for months beforehand.  It is a huge adventure for young people and young children.  We think of parents who bring their children to a concert venue and leave them outside to go in and participate in the adventure.  To think that some of them last night never came back and never will come back is appalling.  What was potentially a night of absolute enjoyment was transformed into a nightmare in which at least 22 people have lost their lives and so many others have been injured.  These are reminders of the depravity of the views of a few.  These beliefs have no place in our society.</p>  <p>  I spoke with the T&aacute;naiste and the Garda Commissioner early this morning about the situation.  I was due to speak to the Prime Minister about other matters earlier this morning but we have rescheduled that conversation for later on this evening.  Our embassy had its lines open all night in London and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and Ambassador Dan Mulhall have been available to offer any assistance that is appropriate.  COBRA, the security briefing committee, met this morning with the Prime Minister chairing it.</p>  <p>  Our security levels here are monitored very carefully by the T&aacute;naiste, the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authorities.  That level remains at moderate, which means an attack is possible but not likely.  The situation for people around the country is that we have a very detailed level of shared information with other countries.  The reason that this level has not been increased in Ireland is that we do not have any evidence of it being beyond the moderate stage.  That is not the situation in Great Britain, where evidence of planned attacks exists.  The Prime Minister speaks for the British Government in that respect.  Last night's attack is a reminder that no one is immune from those whose hatred of our values drives such evil acts.  I assure the public that all the necessary measures are being taken by our authorities here to counteract such deadly threats.  The Garda authorities will continue to work very closely with our UK and EU counterparts and other countries in responding to the threat of international terrorism and violence inspired by extremists.  There can never be any justification for the brutal inhumanity displayed in Manchester last night.  The number of children caught up in these events makes it particularly hard to bear for all of those involved.  Our thoughts and prayers are obviously with the victims and their families and all of those who are affected by this atrocity.</p>  <p>  People in our country are heartbroken by this.  The city of Manchester has such exceptionally close ties with this country for so many reasons over so many years.  We support them absolutely.  Listening this morning to the Mayor of Manchester, and the Mayor of Liverpool whose children were at this concert last night, gives us a sense of how a predetermined atrocity can impact in so many ways and cause such devastation for families.</p><p>I will speak to Prime Minister May later this evening in respect of any details of which we should be aware and any assistance our Government, people and agencies can offer the British people at this time.</p></speech>

It was a barbaric attack on innocents, on children out enjoying themselves at a wonderful concert.  Young people, children and their parents were targeted in an act of inhumanity, cowardice and hatred.  We pay tribute to the emergency services workers who, as always in situations like this, rushed to assist and rescue those in trouble.  The Manchester police chief, Ian Hopkins, said it was the most horrific attack ever faced by Manchester police as he confirmed that children were among the deceased.</p>  <p>  We speak today in solidarity with the people of Manchester and Great Britain.  Our family ties are close and historic.  We join them today in empathy, and also with resilience, to honour the common values and decency that will continue to sustain our open and democratic societies.  We should never forget that those who perpetrate these acts of terror do so to change us.  Their acts are designed to make us more like the perpetrators, to make us turn on ourselves and to undermine our own sense of basic, open and democratic values.  As civilised societies, it is important that we never become victims to that design and intent.  We must remain resilient to protect all that we hold dear in our societies.  Those who have been responsible for this act cannot and must not succeed.  We have to work together with other nations across Europe and with our neighbour Great Britain to make sure we can rid our society of this evil.</p></speech>

Some 22 people, including children and young people, have been killed and dozens more injured in a harrowing attack on people going about their evening, enjoying a concert and having a big night out.  As the Taoiseach said, the excitement of going to a concert, especially for young people, starts months and months in advance.</p>  <p>  What happened is shocking and reprehensible.  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families at this desperately sad time.  I pay tribute to the emergency workers and all those who have been doing all they can to help in the aftermath of this atrocity, including local hotels, taxi drivers, and those who opened their doors to ensure people were safe last night.  The one uplifting feature of atrocities like this and other tragic, terrible incidents is the instinctive way in which ordinary people respond with courage and generosity.  They and the emergency services deserve praise and recognition for their actions.</p></speech>

It is probably no accident that the attack planned for maximum carnage, targeted young women and girls mostly and occurred in the midst of a general election.  It is an attack on our democratic values and, in particular, on the innocence of youth.</p><p>I wish to echo the words of the Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, who said today:</p><blockquote>These were children, young people and their families that those responsible chose to terrorise and kill.  This was an evil act.</blockquote><p>I offer our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families and the people of Manchester.  Ireland has always had strong links with Manchester.  Today, more than ever, we stand alongside the community there as they mourn the needless loss of so many young lives.  It is in this spirit that the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Brendan Carr, has opened a book of condolences, as have his counterparts in many municipal authorities throughout the country.</p><p>I wish to pay tribute to the emergency workers and all the local people in Manchester who have been doing all they can to help in the aftermath of this atrocity.  The strength and spirit shown by the community there is the best response to despicable acts of terror.</p></speech>

I wish the very best to the other 59 people who were injured and I hope they make a full recovery.  I understand that two of the young victims have been identified already: an eight year old girl, Saffie Roussos, and an 18 year old student, Georgina Callander.  For their parents and families and for the families of the others whose lives have been extinguished by this brutal act, nothing will ever resolve the pain and suffering they have to endure today.</p>  <p>  Any attack that deliberately targets children and families who are out simply having fun can be described as nothing other than barbaric and senseless and must be condemned utterly.</p>  <p>  I also pay tribute to the people of Manchester, especially those who opened their homes last night to let in people fleeing the scene, the taxi drivers who drove people for free and those running the hotels that took people in and allowed them to stay the night.  In the face of an horrific act like this, it is important to echo the sentiment of the Manchester Trades Union Council, which said that the people of Manchester - it applies equally to the people of the world - have to respond to horrific acts like this with solidarity and love.  We should never allow ourselves to be caught up in the logic of hate that could carry out such an act.</p><p>It is a twisted logic that imagines the horrors visited on equally innocent people in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan and Iraq, which we must also remember, can somehow justify doing similar things to innocent children and people in Manchester.  We must stand against any action by state actors or terror groups that would target innocent children and people because they imagine it serves some sort of political cause - it never can.</p></speech>

It is almost a part of Ireland itself, which means we get it.  It brings the trauma of what happened home.  There are so many parents here in Ireland who would have dropped off their young teenage girls to the 3Arena in Dublin on Sunday to see Ariana Grande.  To think that those people might not have come home is beyond shocking.  It is horrific.  My daughter would have been there had she not been doing her leaving certificate.  However, it is no less horrific than the pain and torture felt by parents in Yemen, Syria and Iraq who have also lost children.  Young lives have been ended and young lives have been traumatised for ever.</p>  <p>  I do not agree that this is an attack on our values.  It is a response to violence.  Violence begets violence.  In standing shoulder to shoulder with the parents and young people of Manchester, on behalf of Independents 4 Change I must state that the best thing we can do is support peace and neutrality as a way forward for the world.  We want no part in what has gone on.  That is the best we can do in the most horrendous of circumstances.</p></speech>

This was a cold, calculated attack on some of the youngest people in society.  It makes me sick to my stomach to see what should have been a wonderful occasion for young people and their parents attacked by extremists in such a horrific manner.  We must do more to protect our young people in our country, across Europe and all over the globe.  People at the concert last night were as young as eight years of age and some of the fatalities have been identified and confirmed as being as young as eight and 18 years of age.  Just hours beforehand, they were filled with joy to see their pop idol.  In particular, I remember Saffie Rose, whose image I recently saw.  She was eight years of age.  A lovely, beautiful little girl, she could have been anyone's child or grandchild.  She was from Leyland, which is near Preston.  A lovely little girl who was out for a special night and now she is lost.</p>  <p>  It is time that we in Ireland wake up to the fact that we are not exempt from such acts of terror.  We must ensure that we not only have security at organised public events, such as concerts and matches, but that armed garda&iacute; and  members of the Defence Forces are also present.  We must move away from the days when the only check carried out on those going to a concert was for alcohol in a handbag or bag.  Members of the public have called me today and told me that they now fear going to such organised events.  A constituent who is to go to the upcoming Coldplay concert at Croke Park told me shortly before I came into the Chamber that he is seriously considering not going because he is worried about his safety.  It is not good enough that 82,000 of our citizens looking to enjoy an event and a night out could be subjected to such acts of terror.  We must protect these people.</p>  <p>  I call on the Government to ensure that members of our armed forces are on hand at organised public events where large numbers of people are congregated in order to deal with situations that may arise or to prevent an incident such as that which occurred last night from happening.  It is my honest belief that we are currently not prepared for attacks of this nature.</p><p>It is simply not good enough.  It is the responsibility of Government and the Members of the House to ensure we do everything necessary to ensure the safety and peace of mind of our citizens especially when attending such public events in mass numbers.  Our thoughts, prayers and sincere sympathies are with the people affected by such an horrific event.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to pay our respects.  It is very thoughtful, right and proper.  I also thank the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

We express our solidarity with the people of Great Britain and Manchester, in particular.  The attack was on young people, all of whom would have looked forward to the event.  Most would have gotten their tickets months ago.  As the concert got nearer, it is easy to visualise the excitement of youngsters planning what they would wear, who they would go to the concert with and how they would get to and from the concert.  What is not easy to comprehend or visualise is the mindset of those who carried out this outrage.  At the same time as those youngsters were excitedly planning their big night out, evil preparation was taking place, the intent of which was to produce the greatest level of carnage to maximise the worldwide impact and create fear and division.  Atrocities like this leave a deep scar on families and communities.  This one is of such enormity it is difficult to process.  It deserves nothing less than full condemnation for the vile act it is.</p></speech>

The sense is it was an evil and calculated act.  It was calculated in the way it deliberately targeted the most innocent and vulnerable to try to provoke the strongest response.  Sometimes when humanity shows us its most evil, in its most hard to comprehend ways, it sees in return the best in human nature.  Our hearts and minds are with the ambulance drivers who queued along the streets of Manchester last night to go to the scene.  Our hearts and thoughts are with the taxi drivers who brought the other young people home.  In Britain's recent history, its strongest identity in response to bombing is in the spirit of the Blitz.  This attack has all the hallmarks of an ISIS attack.  We met the Coptic Pope recently.  It is remarkably similar to the attack in the Coptic cathedral in Egypt.  The same numbers of people were killed and the same mechanism was used.  There was the same targeting of young, innocent children.  All we can hope for is that, in response, the British people turn away from what the bombers are looking for, which is to instil hatred and division, and instead are inspired with a sense that violence can never win.  We stand for peace and we achieve it through solidarity, tolerance and democratic systems.  Meanwhile, our heart bleeds for those shattered families in Manchester today.</p></speech>
