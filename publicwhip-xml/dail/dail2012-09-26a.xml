By any reading of the statement, it must be seen as a grave disappointment and extremely depressing in terms of their interpretation and understanding of the June deal and their articulation of principles which will govern the so-called separation of bank debt from sovereign debt.  Alarmingly, they describe the role of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in recapitalising banks as a longer term issue.  They state, &quot;Regarding longer term issues, we discussed basic principles for enabling direct ESM bank recapitalisation, which can only take place once the single supervisory mechanism is established and its effectiveness has been determined&quot;.  It is not that it can take place when it has been established; we have to wait to see if it is effective before recapitalisation can take place.  The statement continues:<blockquote>The ESM can take direct responsibility for problems that occur under the new supervision, but legacy assets should be under the responsibility of national authorities ... the recapitalisation should always occur using estimated real economic values.</blockquote>This latter point will have real implications for us.  The statement then goes through the basic order of bank recapitalisation of, first, using private capital, then national public capital and, only as a last resort, the ESM.  Mr. Karl Whelan, an economist who enjoys acceptance across the House, has interpreted this as a message from the three countries to Ireland and Spain to drop dead.  By any analysis, it is either a significant resiling from or a different interpretation entirely of the decision at the June meeting.</p><p><br />  Has the statement come as a surprise to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan?  Did he have any inkling at all that it was coming?  Last week in the DÃ¡il the Taoiseach confirmed to me that since the June meeting he had only met the Slovenian Prime Minister.  He has not met the Dutch or Finnish Prime Minister or the German Chancellor.  Clearly, the grass has grown under his feet since the June summit meeting.  It speaks of an approach that he has adopted to avoid hands-on negotiations himself or direct engagement with other leaders who are key to the working out of the eurozone crisis.  Will he commit to undertake an urgent diplomatic initiative with the Prime Ministers of the three countries to have a clear and honest articulation of what they are prepared to do to genuinely separate bank debt from sovereign debt?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600003#A00400"><p>First, it is important to appreciate the scale of the challenge the European Union and the eurozone faces.  We are now in the fourth year of economic challenges and difficulties.  The Deputy spoke of a clear and honest articulation.  My job as Taoiseach and Head of Government is to deal with the other 26 EU Heads of Government when they meet in formal session.  The decision taken on 29 June at the European Council has been articulated clearly:<blockquote>We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  The Commission will present proposals on the basis of Article 127(6) for a single supervisory mechanism shortly.  We ask the Council to consider these proposals as a matter of urgency by the end of 2012.</blockquote>That was the first element of the decision made by the Heads of Government to break the link between sovereign debt and bank debt and to allow for the direct recapitalisation of banks.  This was clear without any misunderstanding.</p><p><br />  The second element of the decision states:<blockquote>The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  Similar cases will be treated equally.</blockquote>These were the two decisions made about the eurozone and Ireland specifically.  They both stand and will be implemented.  They are decisions, without equivocation, made at the meeting of the Heads of Government on 29 June.</p><p><br />  As the Deputy will be aware, during the course of negotiations, statements can be made from different perspectives.  Last Friday I had the opportunity to meet the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Rajoy; the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Samaras, and the Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Monti.  In each meeting we discussed the ongoing negotiations on the implementation of the 29 June decision.  That is the position and the one taken by the Irish personnel involved in negotiations, including the Minister for Finance who has had intensive discussions with his counterparts who have been very helpful on Ireland's case.  As far as I am concerned, on behalf of the Government, we want to see the clear decision and mandate given by the European Council implemented.  That will be the focus and direction of our negotiations.  It will be to follow through on the decision made to break the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, to allow for direct recapitalisation of banks and, in the case of Ireland, to improve its capacity to meet its debt problems.  As the Deputy will know better than anyone else, it is a deal made in former years that we are trying to unwind.</p></speech>

The point is that the Taoiseach has not followed through on the June deal.  This is a serious statement by three key players in resolving the eurozone crisis - Finland, Holland and Germany which are all seen as significant contributors.</p></speech>

Equally, I have read the statement of the three Ministers for finance.  The euro area summit statement, which the Taoiseach did not quote, states "when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly".  It continues, "This would rely on appropriate conditionality".</p></speech>

The decision taken by the European Council was made by the Heads of Government of the 27 countries.  There was a very clear decision in two parts: first, to break the vicious circle between sovereign and bank debt and allow for bank recapitalisation; and second, to reflect on the capacity of Ireland to meet its debts and provide that equal treatment be given.  These were the two decisions about the eurozone and Ireland.  Those decisions stand.</p><p>  Deputy Martin's point is that these decisions are not being followed up.  Let me tell Deputy Martin about the extent of negotiations involving Department of Finance officials and their counterparts across the board.  They have been intense.  Deputy Martin will appreciate that following the decision of 29 June, yields have come down from above 11% to less than 5%.  They fluctuate, as we know.  The Minister for Finance has followed through directly with his counterparts as recently as two weeks ago in Paris, Rome and Berlin.  He has spoken to other Ministers for finance at the informal meeting in Cyprus.</p></speech>

This is not a decision of three Ministers or any other commentators.  It is a decision made by the Heads of Government of the 27 countries of the European Union, reflecting the analysis of how to deal with the eurozone crisis.  In particular, written into the statement of 29 June was the treatment to be given to Ireland.  We will follow through on that statement and on that decision.  That is the decision.  It is clear and unequivocal; there is no resiling from that decision.  Whatever opinions may be given about banking union, the Commission paper presented recently reflects clearly the decision of the European Council.</p><p>  The challenge and, I suppose, the difficulty for Europe has always been to prove that one has followed through on decisions that were made.  The decision of 29 June was not an opinion.  It was not a theory or aspiration.  It was a specific political decision made not just by Ministers but by the Heads of Government of the Union.  It is set out clearly with no equivocation.  I expect that decision to be implemented in full and, I hope, in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach never sought a write-down despite his pre-election commitments.  The Government has paid unguaranteed, unsecured bondholders in full despite stating that not one red cent would be passing hands.  Next week another â¬1 billion will go to unguaranteed bondholders in Allied Irish Banks.  The Taoiseach's approach has been all smoke and mirrors, like the so-called promissory note deal of last March.  Now, at the end of 18 months of bluff, bluster and hyperbole, it seems we are back at square one.</p><p>  When the agreement was reached at the European Council summit meeting in June, the Taoiseach described it as a seismic shift.  His colleague, the TÃ¡naiste, said it was a game changer.  The Taoiseach told the DÃ¡il and the people that this deal, through the mechanism of the ESM, would lift the burden of bank debt from the Irish taxpayer.  He also told us that the deal was retrospective.  At that time, Sinn FÃ©in said that was not what the Council communiquÃ© stated.  In fact, despite what the Taoiseach has said this morning, were he to go back and read the communiquÃ© he would see it is full of equivocation and conditionality.  The Taoiseach oversold the position last June.  Then we had last night's statement from the finance Ministers.  These are not just any finance Ministers; they are the finance Ministers of the AAA-rated countries Germany, Holland and Finland.</p></speech>

If he is not, he should be.  The Taoiseach tells us that the pace of initiative and negotiation from the Department of Finance has been hectic since June.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the same Department of Finance welcomed the statement of these three finance Ministers last night?  Why did it do that?  What is the Government's strategy from now on to deliver the deal about which the Taoiseach has talked a good deal but which has failed to materialise?</p></speech>

Let me reaffirm to Deputy McDonald, as I did to Deputy Martin, that discussion and negotiation by officials from the Department of Finance and directly between the Minister for Finance and his counterparts, face to face, are ongoing.  We have made substantial progress with regard to the promissory note, which is a very technical and complex issue to resolve because the deal done requires the country to pay more than â¬3 billion per year for ten years.</p><p>  The strategy now is to continue to work to implement the decision of the European Council.  If Deputy McDonald cannot see that this is clear, I will repeat the words of the summit statement: &quot;We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.&quot;  Let me assure Deputy McDonald that this was and is a seismic shift compared to what applied in Europe before.  This was never done before.  It was contemplated but never enacted.</p><p>It was not only talked about on 29 June in Brussels; it was decided.  It was decided, not by commentators or Ministers, but by the Heads of Government.  I would remind Deputy McDonald that all Ministers for Finance are equal when they sit around that table.</p></speech>

The realpolitik of how this will play out is that, unfortunately, in the case of Ireland, because they failed to assert themselves, each of the Ministers is not equal.  The fact of the matter, as the Taoiseach knows full well, is that when there is a joint statement from those three Finance Ministers it is a significant development.</p></speech>

That means that the seismic shift, to which the Taoiseach referred and to which Ministers referred in June last, is now in reverse gear and the Government was sold a pup by Europe and passed it on to the Irish people.  There is no other way of interpreting what happened and there is no point in pretending that this is good news.

The realpolitik of how this will play out is that, unfortunately, in the case of Ireland, because they failed to assert themselves, each of the Ministers is not equal.

It seems that the three most powerful economic countries in Europe, which did not have to issue this statement, quite simply decided to send a message to Ireland and Spain that past debt - the Taoiseach appears to be talking about the future - of the type mentioned will not be eligible for any type of rescue.  That means that the seismic shift, to which the Taoiseach referred and to which Ministers referred in June last, is now in reverse gear and the Government was sold a pup by Europe and passed it on to the Irish people.  There is no other way of interpreting what happened and there is no point in pretending that this is good news.  This is a disaster for the attempts to get out of debt, and particularly to rescue the pillar banks.</p><p>  I ask the Taoiseach to answer this question because I think it is significant.

Speaking to three prime ministers last week, Prime Minister Rajoy from Spain, Mr. Samaras from Greece and Prime Minister Monti from Italy, each one of them, when we discussed the progress being made on the implementation of the Council decision and their own country's position, was clear that this decision of 29 June is what must be implemented for the protection of the euro, for the development of the eurozone and, in particular, in our case, reflecting the decision made in regard to Ireland being named as one of two countries mentioned in the decision.</p><p>  The statement last night is from three Finance Ministers of 27.  The June decision was of the 27 Heads of Government.  As everybody will be aware, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in his dealings with this counterparts, has received strong political support for the difficult decisions and negotiations that are required to unwind the deal that was done previously and to improve Ireland's debt sustainability as per the decision of 29 June.</p><p>  Deputy Ross will be aware of the municipal elections in Finland.  He will be aware that a Government has not yet been formed in the Netherlands.  He will also be aware of the assistance given by Minister SchÃ¤uble to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in his discussions about the promissory note and the technical difficulties there, and his association with the ECB etc.</p><p>  To be clear about this, there was no information about the statement in advance.  The decision of 29 June is clear and unequivocal.  Our efforts, both as a member of the eurozone and the Union, are to implement that decision to protect the eurozone and the euro, and to improve Ireland's debt sustainability which is mentioned specifically in the decision of 29 June.</p></speech>

It is most unfortunate that the Taoiseach did not get knowledge in advance because Ireland and Spain, in particular, are the two nations most affected by it.  It seems that is symptomatic of the way Ireland is now treated in Europe, as the good poster boy who gets nothing in return.  The least we could have got was that knowledge.  We are getting nothing back from Europe for being good Europeans.  We are not even getting information in advance about matters which affect our vital interests.</p><p>  These are not three out of 27 Finance Ministers.  These are the three most economically powerful nations.  These are three triple A-rated nations.  These are three people who will dictate the pace in the next European summit to the other nations.</p><p>  Perhaps the Taoiseach could comment on this.</p><p>This is not just about scoring political points.  Today Reuters states it now appears likely that Ireland will remain saddled with vast amounts of bank debt that will make it harder for the Government to solve banking problems and get the country's finances in order.  That is an international, independent judgment on the State.</p></speech>

That is utter nonsense and if it is the case, someone should be fired from the Department immediately.  This is the most damaging statement on Ireland to come from the European Union in living memory.</p></speech>

When the people made a clear, strong and welcome decision on the fiscal stability treaty, this was followed shortly thereafter by the strongest delegation from the European Investment Bank that had ever come here, with a clear willingness to commit to further investment through that source.</p><p>  I will not decry the appointment of a Minister of Finance by any Prime Minister elsewhere in Europe.  There are 27 involved and there is a statement from three of them.  I return to the point that I believe in the political system being able to deliver.  As I said to Deputy MicheÃ¡l Martin, if there has been a fault on the part of the European Union in respect of its citizens - next year is the year of the citizen - it has been the failure to demonstrate the capacity to follow through and implement decisions made.  The decision of 29 June was clear and unequivocal in two respects - in the protection of the euro and the eurozone and the direct recapitalisation of banks, therefore breaking the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, and second, in improving Ireland's debt sustainability to give equal treatment where others received a deal.  On these two issues, the Minister for Finance, officials and I, at Heads of Government level, will follow through resolutely and diligently.  It is too important to have Heads of Government make a clear and unequivocal decision and not to have it implemented.  Of course, when politicians begin to negotiate on these issues, we have different points of view.  However, there is no resiling and no going back from the clarity of the decision to break the link and improve Ireland's debt sustainability.  That is where we will continue to make our efforts.  As Commissioner Rehn pointed out, he would like to have the issue dealt with by the end of October.  The Minister for Finance has made the point that, realistically, that is not achievable and that it is important to get the right deal.  In that sense, we continue to return to the foundation stone, namely, the clarity of the decision of 29 June made by the Heads of Government.

Given the sense of dismissal of these reports by the Government, I am calling for a comprehensive debate on the serious issues raised by the authors of these reports, particularly the report of the fiscal council which we all agreed should be established to have an objective and independent forum to provide advice for the Government.  I ask the Taoiseach to be proactive in organising and facilitating that debate.  Also, what progress is has been made on the continuation of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill?</p></speech>

I wish to make it clear that the Government will not state its position on the budget in the debate, but with a correction of â¬3.5 billion to be made, we will be quite willing to hear the views of Members on any of the reports or other matters relevant to the budget as we prepare to meet the fiscal targets and adjustment figures set out for 2013.</p></speech>

A judicial appointments commission is in place and assesses the applications of those who wish to be considered for appointment to the Bench.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly has a brilliant record in running the commercial court.  His comments were related to the Supreme Court.  As I said yesterday, the Chief Justice was already a member of the Supreme Court before being appointed by the President as Chief Justice.  Also, two other appointees to the Supreme Court had already been nominated to the High Court before being elevated.  I do not believe anybody could quibble with their integrity, credibility and capacity to do the job as required on their appointment to the Bench.</p></speech>

The Bill will probably not be dealt with until 2013, which will be five years after the bank guarantee of 2008.  If a banking inquiry is to occur, as promised in the programme for Government, it needs to be given some legislative priority.

There are practical considerations here.  A referendum on the rights of children and on child protection is being held in November.  I wish to make it clear to the Deputy that it will be put to the people.  The question of when that will be done depends on certain practicalities.  Ireland will have the Presidency of the European Union from January to June of next year.  The Government has given an absolute commitment in this regard.  The Deputy can take it that the people will have an opportunity to vote on the question of the abolition of the Seanad.</p></speech>

It has been a long time coming, some 20 years, and is a welcome development.  Without doubt, it is a very significant step towards enshrining children's rights in the Constitution.  We note that the current text does not mirror the wording agreed to by the cross-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and while the text before us is an important step forward, Sinn FÃ©in will submit amendments on Committee Stage to bring us back closer to the original agreed text.  We very much hope the Minister will give these amendments her full consideration and that the Government will not block progressive improvements to the Bill, as it stands.</p><p>  The true purpose of the Bill is to provide strong protections for children and make a real difference in their lives.  Of course, when we talk about children, we mean all of them, from every socioeconomic group and every class.  Of course, in this context, we include the children of Traveller families and I am sure the Minister understands why I make that reference in the DÃ¡il this morning.  Notwithstanding any amendment to the Constitution, if we do not have a Government-led strategy to tackle the increasing levels of child poverty within society, in the final analysis, the referendum will amount to little more than fine words.</p><p>  Last week I asked the TÃ¡naiste to commit to child-proofing the budget to be announced in December.  As he did not acknowledge my question on that occasion or give a satisfactory response, I want to put the same question today to the Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I want her to give a commitment that she will ensure Cabinet colleagues will child-proof their departmental budget cuts and tax hikes before making any final decision in advance of December's announcement.</p><p>  The reality of life for many children is a world away from the aspirations in the proposed constitutional amendment.  Over 100,000 children live in poverty and this number has increased in recent years as a result of the austerity policies of the Government and, it has to be said, its predecessors led by Fianna FÃ¡il.  If the Government or any of us is serious about making paramount the best interests of the child, we need to produce a strategy to end child poverty.  In the course of the debate the Minister needs to give a commitment that there will be no measures in the budget which will place even more children in poverty.  The charity which deals with children, Barnardos, has warned that further cuts to social welfare and public services will lead to further hardship and greater incidences of poverty and deprivation for children.  Some 200,000 children live below the poverty line, an astonishing and shameful statistic, while 500 vulnerable young people were recorded as being homeless on census night in 2011.  CSO figures released earlier this month show that the income of households with children fell four times more than that of households without children between 2009 and 2010.  Under the Government's watch, sadly, we know these figures will have increased.</p><p>  An ESRI report published in February on the distributional impact of recent budgets stated clearly that budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes, namely, reductions of 2% to 2.5% for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about 0.75% for those on the highest incomes.  The figures do not lie.  Very many people would have been surprised and alarmed to discover that, in fact, that budget had been the most regressive in a long series of austerity budgets.  The Government has made a choice.  It has sought to protect the highest earners from the worst of the financial crisis.  During its short time in office, it has deepened inequality in our society.  To put it in very stark terms, this has caused real harm to the most vulnerable adults and children.  The ESRI report shows how the Fine Gael and Labour Party budget was the first since the start of the recession that took more from the low paid than those on high incomes.  Let us consider this.  Again, the figures do not lie.</p><p>  Recent CSO figures show that almost one fifth of households with children are struggling to survive.  In 2010 some 19.5% of households were at risk of poverty.  This figure rose to 26% in homes with children aged between 12 and 17 years.  The ESRI report tells us that under Fine Gael and the Labour Party this figure will have increased.</p><p>Barnardos warns that there are increasing numbers of families for whom some level of social welfare support is essential, simply to make sure there is food on the table and electricity to heat their homes.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which knows all about these matters, has told us that 60% of the calls they receive for support are from mothers with children.  The rate of deprivation for our children is higher relative to other countries in western Europe yet, astonishingly, this Government, just like the last, seems intent on deepening this inequality over the course of its tenure.</p><p> What does this collection of facts and statistics mean in real terms for real children?  What it means for children living in consistent poverty is that they can go 24 hours without a substantial meal and are very often cold because their parents cannot heat their home.  Let us imagine that.  How are these children supposed to do homework if they are cold or hungry?  How are the same children supposed to deal with all the normal stuff of just growing up if they are unsure when their next meal might be?  If there is not enough money for food and heat then we can be very sure there is not enough money for increasing school costs, a trip to the cinema, a pair of trainers or a present for a friend's birthday.  Those are the realities and in supporting this amendment and indeed, commending the Minister, we as a party are absolutely insistent that the debate around children and their protection cannot be limited to an amendment to the Constitution.  We want that made real and the most immediate task, in our view, is addressing the issue of deprivation and poverty.</p><p> I am sure it is not lost on citizens or Members of this House that this referendum debate is taking place against the backdrop of the Fine Gael and Labour Party failure to provide an apology and redress for the women and children of the Magdelene laundries and Bethany Home.  Both parties, quite rightly, spoke out against these grave injustices when in opposition but in government they have proven very slow to act.  The integrity of Senator McAleese is not in question.  The work he is doing is a necessary part of the picture but it is not the full picture.  The work of the McAleese committee should not be used, as the Government is currently using it, as an excuse not to move forward in the provision of basic supports and services to these women and in the issuing of a full apology to them.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has repeatedly stated that there is irrefutable evidence of State involvement in these institutions.  That is an accepted fact.  In fact, legislation was enacted in this very House providing a statutory basis for incarcerating women in a Magdalene laundry in Galway.  The evidence is there, in law.  It is game, set and match and there is no issue of debate there.  It is a nonsense for the Taoiseach and his Ministers to hide behind the interdepartmental committee.  They know, I know and the dog in the street knows that the wrong perpetrated by the State, with the connivance of the State, against these women and children is on a par with what happened in the industrial schools.  </p><p> The Taoiseach's role in government was never to simply pick up where the other crowd left off.  He promised it would be different this time around.  That is what he said and people believed him.  They hoped that would be the case but they have been proven sadly wrong.  The only difference, so far, is that it appears that this Government is happy to preside over a situation where the poor get poorer and the ageing wronged still await an apology.</p><p> The Fine Gael and the Labour Party failure to protect the elderly women and children of Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home casts a shadow over their Administration.  These people were failed by the State and well the Taoiseach knows it.  Government inaction deepens the hurt and anguish these people have lived with all their lives.  The Government refuses them their pensions, speedy access to medical care and, crucially, access to counselling.  The Taoiseach refuses, for reasons that baffle me, to say out loud that we failed these women and for that we, collectively, are deeply sorry.  He refuses to tell them they did nothing wrong.  These women, so many of whom were only children when sent to the laundries, did nothing wrong.  Is it any wonder that people do not trust the State with respect to their children?</p><p> Concerns have been voiced about the 50:50 rule with regard to media coverage of referendum debate and speculation has been ongoing in that regard.  There are some on the Government benches who believe that when a proposition is put to the people the only argument that should be put forward is the one supported by the Government of the day.  A citizenâs vote is the most fundamental tool of democracy and to undermine this in any way by excluding alternative voices would be fundamentally wrong.</p><p> Families across the State have very real fears about this referendum.  I am picking that up from people and I am sure other Deputies are too.  They have experienced and seen at first-hand the failure of the State to protect our most vulnerable children.  This failure is not historic but continues to this very day.  The report of the Independent Child Death Review Group documented 196 deaths of children in the care of the HSE or who were known to the HSE between 2000 and 2010.  That report states that while good practice was adhered to in some cases, its application was sporadic and inconsistent.  The authors argued that earlier and more consistent good practice would have increased the chances that these children might have overcome their vulnerabilities.  In that regard, it must be said that there is a very clear resourcing issue for those professionals and services that deal with vulnerable young people.  People see all of that and they absorb the message it sends to them.  The result is that many people do not trust the State to protect our most vulnerable people and in particular, our children.  </p><p> What should the Government do to allay these fears?  I am speaking as someone who will campaign for this referendum and who welcomes it.  It is extremely important, in the course of this debate, that we do not dismiss people's worries and fears.  They are well grounded in the experiences of children in this State, historically and in contemporary times.  We must listen to those anxieties.  We must reassure parents that they will remain the primary carers, protectors and custodians of their children and that it is the State's role to support them in that work.  We should say to parents that rather than being threatened by this amendment and by the State taking on a responsibility for children, they should draw comfort from the fact that the State commits to intervene, in exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear and present danger to the child or the child is being abused.  We are collectively saying that we will not have any more Roscommons.</p><p>We accept that it takes a village to raise a child and that we vindicate the rights of child citizens.  That should be a source of comfort to parents not a threat, but we must be clear and categoric in our approach and aware of the mistakes that have been made in other jurisdictions - in particular in Britain - and ensure that we do not make the same mistakes.</p><p> I make all of those points to underscore the fact that we need a calm and balanced debate.  That means we will hear voices and opinions with which we fundamentally disagree.  We might even take the view that some of the views expressed are factually inaccurate but that is the nature of democratic debate.</p><p> For what it is worth, I call on broadcasters to listen to my appeal-----</p></speech>

In supporting the Bill I challenge the Government to put its money where its mouth is and make a commitment to child-proof December's budget.  I want the Government to do that, at a minimum.  The Government must also ensure a full and frank public debate on the referendum and address the fears of parents and citizens across the State.  Neither must the Government shy away from such fears or concerns.  It is in our collective interest that the referendum is passed.  It is a necessary and long overdue measure.  We have a collective responsibility to embrace a full and frank debate on why we must enshrine childrenâs rights into the Constitution and when we have done that we have the bigger responsibility of making the commitment real.</p></speech>

They can vote for or against an amendment to the Constitution that proposes to treat children as individuals in their own right for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.  It is 20 years since Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In the coming months, the Government hopes to submit Ireland&#8217;s update report on implementation of the convention to the United Nations.  It is fair to say that this country has been making progress in the past 18 months, but that in the 20 previous years we have seen a litany of reports each more disturbing and more heart-scalding than the next.  They are 17 damning indictments of the failure of society and politics to guarantee the safety of children.</p><p><br />  As a politician and a father this affected me no more than many others.  On coming to office it was my privilege to be able to appoint a full Cabinet Minister for children for the first time in the State in the person of Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I was and remain of the view that the children of this country deserved rather more than luck for their safety   They must be able to rely on more than &#8216;happy faults&#8217; to secure their innocence, integrity, and their future itself.  Moreover, I and the Government wanted to make this not just their social entitlement but their constitutional right.  This is a quantum change in a society where for too long children were seen and not heard.  The best place for children is within a loving and supportive home.  The referendum does not seek to change that.  Time and again, unfortunately, we have seen cases where a family for whatever reason - has failed or were unable to protect a child.  Not only that, but in some tragic cases, the family itself - as in the Roscommon case - was the most dangerous and damaging place for a child to be.  I wish to allay the fears of good and responsible parents that this will be a charter for trespass into their family&#8217;s lives.  It will not.  Great care has been taken to ensure that it is not and can never be.</p><p><br />  Since taking office, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Government have been working on the wording of the amendment.  Many Members of the House have worked hard over many years to reach this day.  The work of the All-Party Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has been an invaluable contribution; equally the efforts and contribution of campaigners, organisations and professionals who work with children and members of the legal profession must be acknowledged.  The Bill before the House proposes a new stand-alone Article 42A, titled &#8216;Children&#8217;, which will contain a series of provisions and will be put to the people as one, single, question for their approval.  The proposed constitutional amendment forms part of the wider and urgent reform agenda.  In terms of child protection, specifically, we have introduced a wide range of reforms through the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, the publication of the Children First Bill which will put the Children First national guidelines for child protection on a statutory basis and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  Child protection and support services are having a radical, long-overdue and much-needed overhaul through the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  They are all vital reforms.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, emphasised last night, none of the reforms can have the wide-ranging and permanent effect of the proposed constitutional change.</p><p><br />  The Government is committed - as we did with the European stability referendum earlier this year - to ensure that people have all the information they need to make an informed decision on the 10 November.  To facilitate that, an information website, , has been set up by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It provides information on the constitutional amendment as well as details of the wider reform programme under way in the area of child protection.  A Government information booklet will also be sent to each household in the country.</p><p><br />  The proposed referendum offers children a second chance to have a family.  The wording removes the inequalities in current adoption law.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, highlighted to the House last night that there are approximately 6,250 children in care placements at present, with more than 5,500 of the children in foster families.  The focus is already on family care.  More than 2,000 of the children have been with the same family for more than five years.  The legislation may offer them the opportunity to create an even stronger family bond in the future.</p><p><br />  Every day all over this country parents put their own fears and worries aside to give their sons and daughters the best, most secure, respectful and loving life they can even in the most difficult circumstances.  Our children are our most precious possession.  Every child - regardless of the circumstances of their birth - should be allowed not just to feel valued, but to be valued under the law as the invaluable, irreplaceable beings they are.  I am proud to speak as Taoiseach on a proposal to amend the basic law to the effect that: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&#8221;  I urge everyone, in particular parents, and others tasked with the safety of children to  make every effort to inform themselves on what this referendum  is about.  The wording of the amendment is careful and cautious.  It is formed from cross-party concern and with cross-party support, which I appreciate.  We have heard many thoughtful speeches in this House on the Bill and I look forward to hearing more.  I urge everyone to use their power as democrats to make come out and make a resounding statement in favour of the children of this country, not just for now but for generations to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#H00700"><p>Most children in this country are happy.  Most children in this country are well looked after.  I often stand back in admiration at the way young mothers and fathers look after their children, how they educate them, take them to school, take them to football, hurling, swimming, music and dancing and all the other things children do.  One hears jocose complaints from mothers that sometimes they spend half their lives on the road ferrying their children from one place to another.  When we concentrate on the children at risk who need to be protected, under both the law and the Constitution, we should remember that it is the exception and should look at the norm.</p><p>The norm in Ireland is a situation where there are great families looking after their children, putting a great deal of effort into rearing them and ensuring their physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual development is first-class, very often making enormous sacrifices to ensure their children get the best chance possible.  We are dealing here with something that is now considered essential because of the various incidents throughout the country that came to our attention.  It is very important that the specific rights of the child should be enshrined in the Constitution so that in the very small number of exceptional cases the State may be allowed, with the protection of the Constitution, to intervene to protect those children who are at risk.  That is what is involved here.  It is important because there has been such debate about children being abused and at risk in families and other situations that the norm in Ireland, namely, decent families looking after their children and very happy children being brought forward, very often with great sacrifice to their parents, is forgotten.</p><p> I served on the committee on children's rights that worked to introduce appropriate wording to put into the Constitution.  The committee was very ably chaired by the former Deputy, Mary O'Rourke.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, were members.  The then leader of Sinn FÃ©in, Deputy CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in, made a very strong intervention and was a great attender at meetings.  Deputy Alex White represented the Labour Party and there were many Deputies and Senators of all parties who worked on that committee, clearing away much of the undergrowth and irrelevancy and allowing Members of all parties to concentrate on what was essential.</p><p> In the nature of all-party committees, there were compromises at the end.  The wording introduced, although it enjoyed the support of all parties, probably was not, in some respects, the first preference of any particular party.  In the interests of compromise and unanimity additional words were included.  It was important, therefore, when the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, took over, that the wording would be re-examined and that which was deemed to be redundant or unnecessary was taken out.  I have no objection to that because I believe the words now published by the Minister in the Bill are better, more succinct and focused than the wording that came from the all-party committee.  That is probably the view of many of the colleagues of all parties who served on that committee.</p><p> I have two points in regard to that committee.  Sometimes words are included to get consensus.  There was a phrase that some people believed should have been maintained, namely, &quot;cherishing the children of the nation&quot;.  We know its origin; it came from the 1916 Proclamation but when one considers the Proclamation that phrase was never about children.  Echoing Wolfe Tone, &quot;children&quot; referred to all the people of Ireland, the concept being that Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter would be covered by the common name of Irishman so that all the children of the nation would be cherished equally.  These were not children, however, and the reference was to citizens of this Republic.  Therefore, although it was a nice idea on the part of the committee dealing with the children and the Constitution to incorporate this wording it actually comes from a different origin and was stating something quite different.</p><p> It is also important to remember that when the Supreme Court looks at the Constitution and makes decisions on it, it expects that we, as legislators, do not get involved in inserting redundant language into what we decide is appropriate for amendment.  It looks at such on the basis that the Legislature has examined it and there is no redundant wording so that if a word is included the court will ascribe a meaning to that word on the assumption that we have scrutinised it, and that we intended a meaning when we inserted it.  It is not possible to dress up a constitutional amendment in attractive wording that might appeal to the electorate.  If we do that, the Supreme Court will decide that if we put it in we must have meant something and it will try to decide what is meant.  There can then be a ruling from the Supreme Court which could be different from the intention of the Parliament, the DÃ¡il and Seanad.  I totally approve of the manner in which the Minister pruned the wording that came from the all-party committee and brought it down to a much more succinct representation.</p><p> It is also worth noting that there has been a good record by the State in looking after children.  Unlike what happens in other countries, children at risk in Ireland receive family care through the fosterage system.  By and large, our children at risk are not put into institutions for long periods but are placed in families and have the ambience and protection of the family.  Like all other children, in effect they are brought up within families.  It is very important to acknowledge that and the great work that is done both by so many families who take children on fosterage and the State agencies that monitor their care when they are fostered.</p><p> I wish to comment on the actual debate.  Although very good speeches were made last night across party lines, giving real insight into what is required and what are the intentions of the Minister and the Government in proposing this amendment, nonetheless the debate did not get any mention in news bulletins last night.  The broadcasting institutions, including RTE, have a responsibility to cover not only conflict but also, as public broadcasters, in respect of something such as a constitutional amendment, to explain the intention and to use the debates on all sides of this House, which were excellent last night, to bring those explanations to the attention of the people.  RTE, in particular, as well as the other broadcasting institutions, has a very narrow view of what it may do in terms of covering referenda.  I do not believe it must put a stopwatch on the debate and divide it, 50:50, between those for and against.  I do not believe justice done on sentences, as in the Coughlan judgment, carries that implication.  As long as the coverage is fair and balanced, it seems to me that broadcasters are within their rights of coverage.  In a referendum such as this, where most - I believe all - Members of both DÃ¡il and Seanad, as well as the groups and non-governmental organisations that are most interested in the care of children, advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, inventing opponents to the amendment on the basis of giving 50% of the time to a non-existent set of opponents is a very peculiar way to approach this issue.  RTE should look at this again and if it gives coverage in a fair and balanced way it seems to me it will fulfil the obligations of the judgment.</p><p> There is another issue.  RTE should distinguish between its set-piece debates and news coverage.  In my view, the Supreme Court judgment is not intended to apply to news.  There is an entire area within news where RTE can help the public debate by presenting the facts and the issues, where it is not constrained by the judgment of the Supreme Court.  If it had taken the opportunity last night to report on the Second Stage debate in this House it could have done so without contravening any judgment and without having to invent a bogeyman or bogeywoman to come on and give an alternative opinion, even though such does not exist.  I would like RTE to look again at that because it is important to do so.</p><p> I received a briefing note from the Minister's Department setting out the aims of the new article and I believe this is worth putting on the record as, I am sure, speakers have already done.</p><p>It states that the central aim of the new article is directly to recognise children in their own right within the Constitution and by doing so to give children special protection because of their age and potential vulnerability.  In brief, the constitutional amendment for people to decide by referendum aims to do the following: to place the article in the Constitution which directly deals with children's rights; to revise the language used regarding when and how the State should be able to step in and protect the welfare and safety of a child to put a focus on the child.  This will continue to recognise that children are best reared by their parents and that it is only in exceptional cases where parents fail in their duty towards their children that the State should take action to ensure the safety and the welfare of children; to require that any action by the State to protect children should be proportionate, meaning that actions should be measured strictly by reference to tackling the problems causing harm to the child; to provide that the rights and protections set out in the new article should apply equally to all children regardless of whether or not their parents are married; to allow for the adoption of children in wider circumstances than at present.  This will allow for a revised approach to be set out in law for the adoption of certain children who have been reared by foster parents for a considerable period by reason of the failure of their parents to look after or care for them.  It will allow also for a new law to make possible the voluntary placement for adoption of any child, including children whose parents are married; to add to the strength of existing laws that require the best interests of the child to be the first and most important consideration for judges in deciding court cases concerning child protection and welfare, adoption, guardianship, custody of and access to any child; and to ensure that in making decisions in court cases of the kind already mentioned above the views and wishes of the child should be obtained and taken fully into account bearing in mind the child's age and maturity.</p><p> That last point is very important because it is not only that the amendment will give a specific constitutional right to the rights of children or that the State will be enabled, without any fear of crossing constitutional boundaries, to intervene to protect children in exceptional cases but when the court does intervene to protect children, the child will have a say in its own future.  That is very important.  We are all familiar with children.  Many of us have children and we know that at a very early age children have a reasonably good view of what they want and what is in their best interests.  It is very important that that right should be in the Constitution and that the court should be directed in processes protecting the interests of children to take the views of children into account.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, for the work she has done.  She has done an amazing piece of work after such a long delay.  People were talking about this 20 years ago going back to the Kilkenny incest case when there was a recommendation that this should be done.  After such a short period in Government, it is admirable that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has brought this legislation forward and that she has had consultations with many interest groups and has their confidence to the degree that they are backing this amendment.</p><p> So far the Roman Catholic Church has been silent, and the other churches have not come out on it yet.  I would like if the churches made a clear statement at an early date indicating that they favoured this referendum.</p></speech>

It is a significant piece of work and I broadly welcome it in that parameter.</p><p>  It is somewhat ironic that we have had five referenda on the issue of the rights of the so-called unborn when the rights of born children have been systematically ignored in this State.

I welcome this measure in the context that at the very least it gives us an opportunity to discuss some of these issues and put centre stage the way we defend children's rights and how we identify those rights.</p><p>  The provision and the constitutional amendment is aspirational, which is a good thing.  As a socialist I would generally be aspirational but the disconnect here is the major gap between establishing in theory the rights of children and the reality on the ground in terms of how we can achieve what the Government said is its objective of protecting and vindicating the rights of children against a backdrop of increased economic austerity.  That is the challenge.</p><p>  One would think we would all agree that basic rights such as the right to food, health care, education and so on would be guaranteed to all children and citizens but even during the boom that was not the case.  Traveller children, asylum seeker children and others were left behind and in the new economic climate, with increased costs on families and a decrease in the family budget, it is clear that meeting the basic needs of children is becoming problematic for tens of thousands of families.  The Central Statistics Office stated that an average family needs â¬810 a week to provide adequately for its needs.  Clearly, most families in the State are well short of that.</p><p>  The idea of a secure, happy family home is being threatened by mortgage arrears and in the way the Government is implementing changes in rent allowance, with almost 100,000 people in receipt of rent allowance, many of whom are being forced to move out of the areas they have lived in because of the Government cutbacks.  Their children, some of whose parents campaigned to get them into special schools in the area, have to uproot and leave.  That is not to mention all the cuts to family income support and so on.</p><p>  It is unquestionable that this economic austerity is giving rise to serious mental health problems, depression and so on, linked to financial anxiety in many homes.  Aware reported a 29% increase in calls to its hotline and it linked that increase directly to the debt burden.  It is a constant struggle for many parents to maintain a happy home, and those who face decades of debt or the potential of eviction have a serious problem in trying to provide security for their children.  Unless we address those issues this is a lop-sided debate.</p><p>  That is particularly apparent when we examine the issue of education.  The irony is that one of the few child-centred clauses in our Constitution is the right to free primary education but the dogs on the streets know that it is not free, and many children are not accessing it properly because of economic austerity.  Education and school books costs are rising, and there is extra pressure on families.  I do not have time to develop those points but it is ironic that that right is in the Constitution but in reality it is not.</p><p>  Similarly, that is the case with the clauses whereby any school which gets public money should not have a religious ethos or expose children to indoctrination yet children do not have a right to be excluded from religious instruction as a normal part of the day.</p><p>  This week, sadly, the issue of bullying in schools has been centre stage and the rights of children in that environment must be addressed.  Huge bodies of work have been done on that but unless we address these issues we are only paying lip service in terms of the idea of protecting children's rights in an increasingly unequal society.</p><p>  That might be the reason RTE and the media are not picking up on this as much as they should.  Perhaps people believe that while it is important, and I am not underestimating that it is a step forward, they wonder how much will be achieved by it.</p><p>  Much has been made about the way this legislation will impact on vulnerable children.  The objective is to place the protection of children at the centre of decision making, which is welcome.  There is much talk about early intervention, which would be welcome, but we are being presented here with another of those gaps between reality and aspiration.</p><p> Early intervention means the appointment of further social workers and gardaÃ­ and increased welfare provision to assist those who are struggling.  One can dress it up any way one likes in referring to rationalisation and improved working methods, but the reality is that early intervention means more staff working hours and the adoption of a skilful approach by well trained individuals.  Those who are inexperienced or overworked make mistakes and can cause damage in their interventions.  Budget cuts have led to increased class sizes.  How can teachers try to identify vulnerable children when class sizes in Ireland are the second largest in Europe?  Last week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn, warned that class sizes were going to increase even further.  In view of the fact that there is going to be a shortage of 3,000 teachers in the coming years and in the light of the cutbacks in SNA numbers, how can those on the front line in the education system be expected to identify vulnerable children?  The Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na is already stretched from the point of view of resources and approximately 40 rural Garda stations have closed.  How can the force be expected to maintain a watching brief when its budget has been cut by 8%?</p><p> The issue which lies at the heart of this matter relates to social workers.  This is a matter in which a huge intervention is required.  I understand that approximately 30 social workers qualify each year from the HSE-Trinity College social work degree programme.  This is the only programme from which one can move directly to join the HSE's social work panel.  Last year, however, that panel was suspended and people did not have an opportunity to go on it.  The quotas are not being filled and the embargo on recruitment to the public sector means social workers are becoming increasingly stretched.  These individuals are doing a great deal more of their work by e-mail and engaging in a lot less direct contact.  Against this backdrop, how can children be protected?  This is a contradiction, in respect of which the Government has not provide a response.</p><p> There is a concern that the increased economic desperation and deprivation being experienced and the inability of some parents to cope could result in their having their children taken from them.  If better and enhanced supports were provided, it would lead to happier resolutions within the families to which I refer.  I am assured by those with whom I have raised this matter that the use of the term &quot;proportionate&quot; is sufficient in guarding against people losing their children.  I am sure we all hope that this will be the case.  This is, however, a point which must be borne in mind.</p><p> There has been a great deal of discussion about increasing adoption rights and giving children the opportunity to avail of a second chance in a loving home.  Obviously, the latter is something of which we would all be in favour, but we must be extremely careful in this regard.  The history of adoption in Ireland is not good.  There are tens of thousands of undocumented adoptees who have been robbed of their identities because of the way in which the State dealt with adoption in the past.  I am aware that many of the people in question are concerned that the legislation on adoption which goes hand in hand with the referendum does not deal with issues relating to them.  The legislation to which I refer focuses to a large degree on the adoption in the future of vulnerable children currently in care.  That is fine.  However, there is an urgent need to put in place a system to protect the relevant documents and files required for tracing families, etc.  The most basic right a person has is that which relates to possessing the facts relating to his or her own identity.  There is a need to place this matter centre stage.  The possibility of a child who has lived in foster care for more than three years and resided with a particular family for 18 months being adopted has the potential to be good and I welcome this development.  However, we must ensure the child's view will be central to this.  I am glad that this aspect is being respected and emphasised.</p><p> Very few people are going to oppose the referendum.  The really good aspect of the referendum is that it gives us the opportunity to discuss and highlight some of the complexities relating to the issues to which I refer.  However, we need to do a great deal more to really vindicate children's rights.  This will involve standing a large amount of Government policy in other areas on its head.  I refer, in particular, to policy relating to economic areas.  When the budget comes around, we will be calling on the Government to put its money where its aspirations lie.  If it does not do so, the State will fail children yet again.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Minister and anyone else who has been working on the proposed new article to the Constitution and whose efforts have resulted in it being brought forward for discussion.  In any set of circumstances priority must be given to discussing the needs and rights of children.  We must ensure these needs and rights are protected in law in every way possible.  There is an even greater need in this regard in Ireland because there is a history of chronic failure on the part of the State to protect children.  We have debated some of the State's failures in this regard during the past year or so, including the horrors experienced by those who were placed in the industrial schools, the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home residences.  The failures to which I refer did not just occur in the distant past, they also happened more recently.  I refer to the appallingly large numbers of children who were in the care of the State or for whom the State had a responsibility who died because it had failed to take steps to provide them with adequate protection.  The failure to which I refer continues.  We have a long way to go to ensure the rights of children will be protected.  For example, there have been reports of serious abuse and the neglect of immigrant and refugee children in direct provision hostels.  The Irish Refugee Council has called for an investigation into this matter in view of the fact that we do not know what is happening in these hostels or whether the rights of the children in them are being fully protected.  There is also the example of children being placed in adult psychiatric wards because there is not an adequate number of child psychiatric places available.  It is clearly not in the interests of children to be place in adult wards.  Another example of the State's failure relates to the fact that, as a number of previous speakers indicated, the level of child poverty has actually increased in recent years as a result of the austerity measures being imposed.</p><p>  Against this background, it is extremely important that the legislation before the House has been brought forward and that the entire population should debate how we can fully protect and vindicate the rights and welfare of children as an absolute priority.  In that context, there is no doubt that the constitutional amendment will improve the situation.  The fact that children were not specifically identified for protection within the Constitution meant that the constitutional imperative to protect the rights of the family often came in conflict with the requirement to protect children.  It is both right and proper that the Government is moving to redress the balance and ensure the rights of children in the context of being heard and protected will be vindicated and placed at the centre of the Constitution.  It is obvious that an issue also stands to be addressed in circumstances where parents who are willing to have their children adopted are impeded from doing so simply because they are married and so on.  The change in this regard is very welcome.</p><p>  Having said all of this, I must point out that there is a problem.  This is not a problem which would lead me to oppose the amendment which should be supported, but laws, constitutional amendments and words on a page do not, in and of themselves, guarantee the rights and protections children need.  Please allow me to state the obvious.  Those who were placed in industrial schools, Bethany Home residences and Magdalene laundries were overwhelmingly the children of the poor.  It was they who ended up being neglected and abused by the State.  It is still overwhelmingly the poor, the least well-off and the most vulnerable in society who have needs and difficulties and require protection.</p><p>Simply asserting the legal right of children to be heard and protected, without addressing the root cause, will not solve the problem.  Therefore, a constitutional imperative to protect children has to be backed up with the required resources to make this happen.  I refer specifically to the health and social services to be provided.  We must ensure child poverty is eliminated, that no child is in need of food or adequate housing and health care, that no child is disadvantaged educationally or will be disadvantaged if the State does not provide necessary supports for children in trouble or in difficulty or subject to abuse or neglect.  While this legislation is welcome and points in the right direction, everything else the Government is doing in all of these areas is moving us in precisely the opposite direction.  It is moving us away from a situation where children would be adequately protected.</p><p> Child care teams must be fully resourced, but the Children First guidelines for the protection of children have not been adequately implemented and remain to be placed on a statutory basis, although I acknowledge the Minister is working on this aspect of the matter.  However, resources such as sufficient numbers of social workers will be needed.  It is a question of how to square the â¬700 million in further cuts due to be made in the next budget and the â¬2 billion in health cuts made in recent years with a commitment to protect children and how to provide the resources necessary to protect children, considering the level of cuts planned in health funding in the December budget.  How do we deal with the cap on the number of special needs assistants when we know that there are children who need support in the classroom and are being denied it or are not receiving the same level of support as they received in the past because of the cuts imposed by the troika in order to bail out bankers?  These cuts run directly counter to the commitment to protect children.</p><p> Yesterday I raised the issue of cuts in the home help service.  What happens if a mother develops schizophrenia or another debilitating illness and needs support and assistance but does not receive it?  It is often the case that young children and teenagers have to look after their parents, with all of the consequences there might be for their development, rights and so on.</p><p> The policy of cutting lone parent supports, the number of special needs assistants, home help hours and the incomes of the least well-off will inevitably drive children into dangerous situations because the poverty that is visited on their parents has knock-on consequences for them.  Unless we address the policies which are causing poverty, it is difficult to see how this proposal can make a significant difference.</p></speech>

Durkan.</p><p><br />  I commend my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for bringing this transformational proposal for a referendum before the House.  I also commend all Members of the House for the cross-party support for this measure.  I commend the civil society groups which have been forceful in their support for the amendment of the Constitution on the rights of children.  That support is crucial.  However, it is important that a full debate take place on the airwaves and in the media generally.  I share the concern of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that the media provide for a full debate on the issue.  I acknowledge there are constraints in terms of balance, but this should not stop the media from airing and discussing the issue which is crucial for democracy and, in particular, the welfare of children.  We should not take the view that the proposal need not be fully debated and should be nodded thorugh.  I commend all those who have participated in the various committees which have discussed this issue and the wording of the referendum.</p><p><br />  There has been much debate and discussion and also a recognition of what has happened in the past.  There have been 17 reports since Judge Catherine McGuinness's report on the Kilkenny incest case.  We have all been struck by the appalling manner in which many children were treated in the past.  The case I remember most is that of Sophia McColgan and what happened in her family.  Despite the fact that various agencies of the State were involved with the family, it took a long time before there was an intervention.  The proposed amendment of the Constitution, if agreed to by the people, will bring about a change in how children will be treated in the future.  It will be a case of building a system of protection to give every child in the State, particularly vulnerable children, the opportunity to have a nurturing and secure childhood.  It is about changing attitudes to children in order that they will be seen and heard and that their views will have weight and consequence.  It is about enshrining in the Constitution a vision of children as citizens recognised as having an entitlement to inherent rights that must be vindicated.  The principle that the voice of children should be heard is very important.</p><p><b></b>We do not wish to have the debate distracted by what is not contained in the proposed wording.  The role of the family is still central and Article 41 is not being interfered with.  In a small minority of cases there are dangers to the safety and welfare of children and the amendment of the Constitution will provide the State with the authority to intervene in such cases in clearly defined circumstances.  However, there will be safeguards, a balance and proportionality in any measure undertaken.</p><p><br />  I refer to the proposed Article 42(A).2.2Â°.  This important reform addresses a lacuna in Bunreacht na hÃireann which currently does not refer to the circumstances in which adoption will be provided for in law.  In the case of foster parents adopting a child, the current test is extremely arduous.  As such, the number of children in foster care who are adopted is very low.  The Minister indicated last night that the number was just 16 children in 2010 and 2011.  More than 2,000 children have been with the same foster family for more than five years and have not had the opportunity to be adopted.</p><p>The proposed wording will allow the Oireachtas to debate and pass a new adoption Act.  In this regard, I commend the Minister on the publication of the draft adoption (amendment) Bill 2012 in tandem with the referendum proposal.  This will afford citizens a clear perspective on the constitutional and legislative reforms that will flow from a "Yes" vote on 10 November.</p><p> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to the broader range of issues relating to children and child welfare.  It is important to emphasise that the proposed constitutional amendment is just one measure, albeit perhaps the most important one, in the Government's reform agenda in the area of child protection.  Efforts in this area include the passing of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, the introduction of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 and ongoing work on the Bill to place the Children First guidelines on a legislative basis.  The proposed child and family and support agency, functioning independently of the Health Service Executive, will ensure the principles enshrined in the constitutional amendment become a reality in the lives of thousands of children in this country.</p><p> The forthcoming campaign will be beneficial for democracy by allowing citizens to focus on the future of our children.  This is an issue that is central to any democratic society but one that has, unfortunately, been too often neglected in the past.  The referendum will mark a new beginning in efforts to safeguard the welfare of children and to cherish childhood.  The debate in this House is the starting point of that process but we must also strive to engage the broader public.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her ministerial colleagues on the time, effort and dedication that went into the preparation of the proposal which is before us today.  Given that there has been some debate as to whether it is really necessary, it is important to reflect on the reasons for the bringing forward of the proposed constitutional amendment.  The unfortunate reality is that it is indeed necessary.  The evidence of the past 20 years or so has shown that for one reason or another and in various circumstances, children in this country were not only neglected but wilfully neglected and had their rights seriously undermined.  This was the case even during the period which became known as the Celtic tiger era and it was not just the children of families in poverty who experienced it.  In fact, throughout the past two decades there was a serious erosion of the individual child's rights which pointed clearly to a deficiency in the system.  If action could not or was not taken, for whatever reason, we must now find ways to address that deficiency.  The objective must be to ensure there is no recurrence of what happened in the past.</p><p>  As I said, the view has been expressed in some legal quarters that the proposed constitutional amendment and accompanying legislation are not necessary.  Everybody is entitled to their opinion, of course, but I reject that view.  What is true is that while the amendment certainly should not be necessary, unfortunately it is.  That is the difference.  Over the years there have been numerous cases showing clear evidence that where children were subjected to serious deprivation and wilful neglect, there was an inability or unwillingness on the part of the State and its institutions to intervene.  It is important to consider these issues from a child's perspective.  Children are vulnerable and very much react to what they see around them.  They need to feel they are in a secure and stable environment, whether in a family setting, in an institution, at school or at play.  Everything is a challenge to children.  If one studies a child's reaction in a strange environment, one will see that he or she is drinking in the surroundings and will inevitably react as he or she knows best.  What of the child whose best interests are not being served, whether in the family setting or otherwise?  Such a child becomes accustomed to whatever he or she is being subjected to on an ongoing basis.  It must be an appalling thing for a small child to find himself or herself in that situation and not to know any other way.  It is equally appalling that adults who should know better allow these types of situations to prevail.</p><p>  That is why we are now obliged to insert into the Constitution a specific measure which sets out clearly the rights and entitlements of children and the need to ensure they are protected in all circumstances.  It does not follow, however, that the State is obliged to intervene between child and parent.  As several speakers have observed, the family already retains a privileged position under our Constitution and must be protected.  That will not change.  Only in particular and specific circumstances, where it is clear that the family situation is failing, will the State have a responsibility to intervene.  Several speakers suggested that it should be open to any person to intervene in such circumstances, but I am not convinced by that argument.  Regardless of who intervenes, there will now be a provision in the Constitution which clearly sets out to protect the well-being, rights and entitlements of children.</p><p>  Some of us have been in this House longer than we care to remember and were members of health boards in the past.  That experience was a great school of learning in so far as child welfare is concerned.  Many people working in the health services over the years were futuristic in their attitude and recognised the need for provisions specifically to address the concerns of those dealing with children's welfare.  These people expressed their views on the matter liberally and some took action, by way of pilot schemes and so on, to introduce measures which they hoped might be adopted on a general basis.  We had an opportunity to learn the full extent and circumstances of neglect in the various cases that have been brought to our attention in recent years.  We must not forget, however, that the same degree of neglect still goes on today.  I am sure a week does not go without some incident of this nature being brought to the attention of public representatives.  Sometimes these matters are simple to resolve and sometimes not.  It is an ongoing issue.</p><p>  Looking beyond the constitutional proposal, it vital that we have effective follow-up in the area of child and youth services.  I and others have tabled parliamentary questions to encourage this development in the future.  The need for a comprehensive support service for youth was never more obvious than at present.  There was a tendency during the Celtic years to neglect the basics and to revel in our apparent wealth.  In fact, we neglected many issues of major importance.  We now have an opportunity to ensure, in the context of the legislation coming on stream, that we have an adequate and comprehensive back-up service for children at various stages in their development.  Children must never find themselves disadvantaged or pushed into a situation where they are exploited or have their well-being and welfare placed in jeopardy.</p><p> Deputies have frequently debated the issue of out-of-hours services.  One positive aspect of the constitutional amendment is that the provision, as laid down in the Constitution, will have to be observed.  Nothing can change that fact and there can be no deviation from that provision.  It cannot be watered down in any way, which means we will not be able to decide that we will only do certain things in certain circumstances but will be required to do what must be done.  </p><p> Although a great many families have suffered as a result of the economic downturn, this does not necessarily mean that people who have suffered economic deprivation will reject their children.  Far from it because history shows that seeking to ensure the best for their children has been the hallmark of 99.9% of parents in this country.  That will remain the position, which is as it should be.  However, circumstances will arise where it will be clear that the welfare and well-being of a child are at risk.</p><p> A fair amount of other legislation is proposed and will be helpful.  For example, it is important to note, as the Minister of State and her colleague, the Minister for Finance, have done, that more than 2,000 children have been living for more than five years with foster families.  Confidence is important to young children growing up and living in a safe environment and feeling secure assist in their development.  While foster care is helpful in this regard and we are fortunate to have a system of fostering in place, a question mark about whether the care will continue hangs over all children in foster care at all times.  Uncertainty is unfair to children and I hope it will be addressed in the context of the forthcoming constitutional amendment.  It is of critical importance that we provide the supports families require and that where intervention proves necessary, it is undertaken in a positive manner that protects children and enhances and supports families in the first instance. </p><p> Nobody should view this legislation as a threat or as in any way undermining the position of the family.  That is not the intention behind the Bill, as all Deputies recognise.  At the same time, while Ireland is not unique in the number of cases of child abuse and neglect, we are all aware of what should have been done in the past and what must be done in the future.  This legislation means we now know it will be done.  However, as with all legislation that is brought before the House, it will only be as good as its implementation.  If we fail to enforce or operate any aspect of this or other legislation, we will have serious questions to answer. </p><p> The country has come through a terrible experience in recent years.  Having been at the top of the economic pile, as it were, we have plunged into an abyss.  In such circumstances, individuals and entire groups in society tend to be ignored.  This is a danger to which we need to be alert.  For this reason, we must try to ensure that, in accordance with the sentiments expressed in the legislation, we live up to what we set out to do rather than only paying lip service to its provisions.  We must put in place the measures and supports that are necessary because they will bear rich fruit in creating a new generation of children who can have a degree of assurance that they have security and support, either in a family environment or, in the event of the failure of their family, from a second family.  It is hoped such children will be able to develop into well adjusted individuals with the confidence required in this challenging world.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Government's decision to hold the referendum on a Saturday.  I hope it is one that will hold for future votes.  I had a discussion at the weekend with a highly aggrieved eight year old who wanted to know the reason we were holding a referendum for children and the reason she was not getting a day off school.  Not everyone can win.</p><p>  A narrative is emerging on the benches opposite, generally from newer Deputies, that nothing was done before the Minister's appointment and that she did all the work on this issue in the past 18 months.  While I accept that she has done considerable work, this narrative ignores the work of previous Ministers, including the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews; our late and much missed colleague, Brian Lenihan; the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, on which I served for several months in the previous DÃ¡il.  As an aside, that cross-party committee which was chaired by our former colleague, Ms Mary O'Rourke, showed how a committee of the Houses could work.  It was well chaired and supported, properly resourced and its members had access to all the legal expertise members required.  As we struggle to find models for parliamentary committees following last year's referendum, we would do well to examine the way in which it operated.  The emphasis on trying to achieve cross-party consensus on this issue was the reason it took so long to hold the referendum.  However, alongside the process on the constitutional amendment, significant legislation was implemented in many areas and substantial investment was made in physical infrastructure for children, including community child care facilities.  The subtle narrative that the Minister has waved a magic wand and suddenly transformed everything is wrong and unfair to those who served previously in the House.</p><p>  It was extraordinary how much time the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children devoted to definitions of specific words.  As someone who is not a lawyer, I noted the passion with which legal experts discussed words which laypersons believed to have the same meaning.  Lawyers have an amazing skill to ascribe to one word many meanings which were probably never intended in the English language.  The great thing about the referendum on 10 November is that the lawyers and, to a certain extent, legislators will have to step aside and allow children to step forward and finally have their day out.  However, we owe children and for this reason we, as legislators, cannot fully step back.  It would be wrong to believe the task of protecting children will be done and dusted when or if the referendum is passed. </p><p>  During the contributions of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, I reflected on how we would engage members of the public in the debate on the referendum.  During the years people were shocked to the core by many of the reports published on individual cases such as the death of Kelly Fitzgerald.  One of the difficulties we face is that, having been engaged and horrified by the many cases of neglect and institutional support that emerged in the past, people appear to believe the problem has gone away.  We need to remind them that children in these cases were mistreated or abandoned by their families under the watch of the State.  For this reason, we must do everything possible, including passing this constitutional amendment, to ensure we do not wake up some morning to read similar reports in the newspapers of institutional neglect.</p><p>It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge that during this time of much neglect and people dropping balls, there were many heroes within the system.  There were many social workers who tried to battle lack of resources and, more important, a legal system which did not help them do their jobs.  There were many who stood up to the plate, some of whom paid with their jobs.  There were the foster families who will, for once and for all, get some sort of certainty because of this referendum.  Deputy Durkan put his finger on their amazing work by stating they did it in uncertain circumstances.  These families provided safety, a home and the security of the family unit to many children.  I have read stories of foster parents who had up to 1,000 children go through their families over the years.  These are the heroes during this time.</p><p> There were also many people who stood forward to be advocates in many of the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, like Mr. Geoffrey Shannon who has been a persistent and consistent advocate for children's rights.  For those concerned that this referendum may open up the care system and push more children into care, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon's words are important.  He says it will lead to the right children going into the care system.  That is the children who are lost to the system, whose rights  were ignored as was the State's responsibility to them, whose health and future was destroyed because the State could not act.  These are the kind of children who need to be brought into the care system.  These are the children who will, if this referendum is passed, get the care and attention they need.</p><p> We will be proposing some amendments to strengthen the referendum which will be discussed with my colleague, Deputy Troy.  It is interesting to watch this House unite fully behind this referendum.  It is important we mobilise people in the coming weeks.  The date for the referendum, 10 November, is only a short time away.  It is important that the information that is needed will get to people in a cogent and understandable way.  There are complex issues here and the difficulty with them is that they can be twisted to suit agendas of which we might not even have thought.  Suddenly in the middle of a campaign, these could become firelighter issues.  To avoid that, people need to be given proper information well ahead of 10 November.</p><p> Although the House has united behind this referendum and all suggestions are that it will be passed, it is incumbent on all of us to go out there and fight for it.  We must explain it to those in our constituencies.  We cannot take this referendum for granted.  If we do so, we are taking those children who fell out of care and who were abandoned by the State, some of whom may not have survived that abandonment, for granted too.  We owe it to those children, to their families and to those who stood up to the plate that the referendum is passed with a large turnout.  It would be wrong, given all the reports we have had into the neglect of children by so many State, church and education institutions, not to.  This is an opportunity to say, as a country, this is the end of such neglect and the start of something different.</p><p> If it is to be the start, then the Minister's job is not finished after 10 November.  Her job then will be to ensure the wording, the ethos and the preference of this amendment are backed up by resources and social workers.  We must finally resolve the issue of the on-call social worker.  Children are not nine to five; their difficulties are 24 hours, seven days a week.  We need a system that responds to them on that basis.  I welcome the fact the Minister published the adoption legislation.  It is important it is enacted and properly resourced.  As Deputy Durkan, who has been in this House much longer than I have, stated, the intention is great but the difficulty is that after 10 November we will move on to the next item like the budget.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure the necessary resources and the legislation are put in place to turn this constitutional amendment to Bunreacht na hÃireann into a practical format which will benefit people's lives.  It is also incumbent on her to ensure the social workers on the ground are empowered as soon as possible.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work to date but her job is only starting.</p></speech>

As has been said, this issue of constitutionally recognising children's rights has been under consideration for some time.  The Minister's predecessor had been working diligently on this for a long time.  While I am not an advocate of emergency legislation or constitutional amendments, it has been quite some time since the range of issues which gave rise to this referendum, such as the institutional care of children, children in society and the adequacy of family circumstances in individual cases to cater for their needs, have been considered.</p><p>  The proposed Article 42A will recognise and affirm the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child with laws enacted to protect and vindicate them.  In the exceptional circumstances where the capacity of the family to cater for and avoid any level of neglect to children is a problem, the State will be in a position, as the guarantor of the common good, to step in and provide the children with foster or adoption facilities so they can move to a new family environment which will set the foundation for their well-being in the years ahead.  The Minister is also bringing forward new legislation for adoption.  Bringing the two forward in tandem is wise at this time.</p><p>  I have no doubt this referendum will give rise to much legal debate.  I hope, however, we do not get into a debate about competing rights â the rights of the family on the one hand and the rights of the individual child on the other.  This legislation is essentially about providing the best possible family ambience for all children.</p><p>  At this point there is no harm in deliberating on some of the underlying societal problems we have.  Louth and east Meath have new urban centres sitting side by side with rural towns.  From time to time, the whole gamut of social problems comes up on the radar of my constituency clinics.  During the Celtic tiger era, I was always struck how some schools' boards of management set up breakfast clubs for pupils.  On many occasions, I saw the benefit of these clubs at first hand in the schools.  If a schoolteacher finds children coming to school hungry, there is an underlying social problem.  It is not always possible for social workers to go into individual family circumstances and effect change overnight.  We need to bear this in mind.</p><p>Society and societal attitudes and values have changed remarkably in this country in the past 25 or 30 years.  Perhaps the problems that this legislation is focused on existed previously but because we had different societal attitudes or values they did not surface in the public domain to the extent that they are surfacing nowadays.</p><p> It is not only the extremes.  Inevitably, the media and the public view will always focus on the extreme cases, no matter what the subject of debate is.  The old principle that hard cases make poor law is relevant in these circumstances.  Many families are in difficult socioeconomic circumstances now, more so than they would be in the normal cycle of economic well-being in the country, and they need to be considered.  I imagine the proposed amendment is not regarded as a panacea to tackle these individual problems.  The Legislature should consider these things.  In recent times we had a crisis in funding in the health service, which is rather important for many families in the circumstances we are debating today.  A decision was taken to transfer â¬35 million earmarked for the mental health sector to plug a hole somewhere else.  That decision should be reflected on and reconsidered.  There are significant mental health problems.  Some are direct and some are indirect contributory factors to the problems under discussion here.  There is a need to provide more resources to help tackle these problems.  The mental health support programme in the Department of Health has an Achilles heel.  Mental health is regarded as an area that we can provide for only if we have some money here and there.  As a society we need to consider the priorities in that area and to provide the resources for it.</p><p> I hope the debate does not turn into a tug-of-war between the priorities and needs of the family on the one hand and the individual child on the other.  I am sure that is not what was envisaged but it is something we need to bear in mind.  There has been a change in the community support framework.  No matter what the society, we have a prejudicial view that community activity only takes place in a rural environment, but the potential for it to occur in an urban environment is even more obvious provided we have good, well-motivated community leaders to make it happen.</p><p> I recall a visit to a particular school in Dundalk which focused on special needs education.  The teachers were involved in service apprenticeships and youth work around the town.  The school was in a area of socioeconomic deprivation.  I was particularly impressed with one thing.  The teacher in charge of the school went to households where children were missing from school for several days to see where they were and to ensure that their homework was done and that the work given to them by the school on that day or previous days was undertaken.  We need to actively encourage family support to ensure there can be enhancement or improvements.  No matter what the level of academic activity or study, it is possible with diligence and application in the family environment to effect change and improvement.  Perhaps as a community we should consider where we can go into individual households and help them to reorganise.  The legal empowerment to do that may be missing now but we need to consider this area.  I say this as someone who has been in the House for several years.</p><p> There will be a clear and tangible benefit to us if we support families in need.  Inevitably this will entail further resources being made available to us.  It is a question of prioritising and anticipating the social difficulties that give rise to the problems on which this debate is focusing.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  I support what is being proposed.  I wish the Minister well and I thank her predecessors for their work in this area as well as the officials who have been dealing with the preparatory work for the referendum.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the endeavours of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, with respect to the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  The proposed new Article 42A.1 states: "The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights."  Why is this needed?  Why do we need to have this debate if we have a Constitution with the provisions of Articles 40, 41 and 42?  Are these not sufficient to safeguard the rights of children?  These questions have been raised by some voices in society opposed to the current amendment.  I admit to being left in some confusion about why anyone could continue to raise these questions today.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary is quite right: we need to be on message when it comes to this issue as we approach a difficult and challenging time economically in this country.  Let us not forget that during the past 20 years, from the Kilkenny incest investigation report in 1993 through to all the revelations and reports into child sex abuse, testimony has been given by thousands of children who have suffered throughout the history of the State since Independence.  This has continued up to the most recent reports of the deaths of children in the care of the State.  We can be in no doubt of the need to amend the Constitution.  Society's attitudes allowed these abuses to continue and they must be challenged.  This amendment, particularly the article quoted above, will lay down a marker to help and foster a new attitude in this country to children and their rights.</p><p>  One significant change that will result from the amendment is that all children will be treated equally with regard to adoption, regardless of the marital status of their parents.  All children will be treated equally when it comes to the protection of their welfare.  The first legislative act to follow from the amendment will be the Adoption (Amendment) Bill.  This will allow for children of married parents who have been placed in the care system and abandoned or who have been subject to serious failure in respect of the duty of care of children by their parents to be eligible for adoption.  The spirit of the amendment will demand further legislative acts.  It will change the philosophy of the Government with respect to underpinning the care of children in society.</p><p>  Two areas that need attention come immediately to mind.  The first is the need for an improvement in the standard and quality of how we approach the welfare of children in the care of the State.  Second, we must be in a position to guarantee that no child or vulnerable young adult will ever be placed in an adult mental ward or mental health unit.  There are many others to which I am keen to refer, and I thank the Minister for her availability and understanding in this respect.  I welcome the philosophy with which the Minister has approached this Bill and I warmly and unconditionally support her in her endeavours in this respect.  I understand what we are trying to achieve here, but the country must also understand what we are trying to achieve.  This has been a key objective of both Government parties in our manifesto and it is a key area of the programme for Government.  It is important that the country sees that we are honouring this.</p><p> While economic issues continue to dominate the political agenda in this country, there remain many important issues that require attention and this is one in which I look forward to playing a role with respect to communication.  This referendum has been a journey of a thousand miles, but we must take care and ensure that no scare tactics engender challenge to the passing of this vital amendment.  I note from discussions with Labour Party members across the country that they will be active on the ground in this campaign and it is incumbent on all political parties to play a role in ensuring that this amendment is successfully passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#R00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  As Deputy Keaveney stated, this was a promise in the Labour Party manifesto and it was also in the programme for Government.  Therefore, I am delighted that we are holding a referendum on this issue on 10 November.  I am delighted because the children's referendum has been a long time coming.  A total of 17 different reports since 1993 have outlined the State's failings in child protection since its foundation.  Each of those reports described in horrific detail the ordeals that children had to go through because of either family or State neglect and I think we all agree that these situations cannot be allowed to continue.  The sad reality is that all public representatives have come into contact with persons whom the State has let down.  It is incredibly difficult to listen to their individual stories knowing that we all were part of a society which allowed this to happen.  Voting "Yes" to this amendment on 10 November will give children who are being neglected or abused a much better chance at getting the protection they need when they need it.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment has been carefully put together.  There were 64 different meetings of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  Over the past year the Minister and her staff have been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the amendment does not take away from any other right that is currently in the Constitution.  This is an important point to make and one that we will need to continue making over the next seven weeks.</p><p>  This referendum is about reaffirming the Irish people's commitment to the protection of children.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, the amendment once again confirms the status of the family as the best place to raise a child.  It is not that the State knows more than the family about how to raise a child.  There is a concern out there that some groups may use the status of the family as a way to campaign negatively against this referendum.  I hope this is not the case, and that we are facing into a referendum campaign that will be positive.  I would hate to see some sectors in society use this campaign to promote their own narrow social agendas.  Let us take the opportunity to say to each child who is growing up in this country that he or she is important and the State will provide for him or her when others cannot.</p><p>  My party is planning a positive campaign.  We have appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to lead this campaign as our national director of elections.  She met with her campaign team yesterday and they are planning a wide range of activities such as putting up posters and distributing leaflets across the country, and also going out to knock on doors and ask members of the public to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.  Our membership will be right behind us.  I myself was out knocking on doors in Kells last weekend and I spoke to several hundred people.  The key message for me was that people know the referendum is being held and welcome it, but my worry is that they said almost universally that it would sail through.  This will not sail through unless we convince people to go out and vote for it.  That will be the key message for me and for my team over the next few weeks, and one that the Government must bear in mind.  We need people to go out and vote &quot;Yes&quot; for this.  Sitting at home will not pass the amendment.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister and her staff for constructing a form of wording that has been welcomed by the vast majority of child protection groups out there and by others in society, and I wish her all the best in this referendum campaign.</p></speech>

I also commend the Government, and indeed the Minister, for producing a Bill the wording of which is widely lauded by political society and civil society alike.</p><p>  Currently, children's rights are lacking, and the Constitution as it stands is failing them.  The obvious absence of provision for children's rights in Bunreacht na hÃireann is stark.  We have seen evidence of the impact of this absence before now and we need to make this a thing of the past.  It has been obvious that this major problem needs to be rectified, and the answer to a legal problem can only be a legal remedy.  As such, a fundamental change to the way we treat children in the Constitution is necessary.</p><p>  Historically, parents' rights were seen as paramount and, despite evidence to the contrary, it was widely accepted that parents knew best.  The family was afforded special protection by the State.  This special protection can be seen in many different cases over the years and while no one is denying that the family has a special interest and should have that place of paramount importance in the Constitution, it cannot be used to denigrate the rights of children as a secondary issue.</p><p>  The Kilkenny incest case, the Ryan commission report, the baby Ann case and the Roscommon incest case are all glaring examples of failings not only by the legal system but by successive Governments that have shied away from implementing the legal changes necessary to protect our children.  When we look back over these reports, the details of which can only be described as abhorrent, it is clear that the State failed to protect the victims in each.  The Kilkenny incest case highlighted a legal stumbling block.  It found that the strong emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution could give a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of children.  The proposed amendment means that children will be protected from harm in the future and will place the child at the centre of decision-making regardless of his or her parents' marital status.</p><p>  The Ryan report shocked the nation.  That children were suffering systematic abuse in more than 200 State-funded institutions was a blatant indication of the lack of protection afforded to them.  In that report it was advised that the needs of children should be foremost in all policies affecting children.  This amendment ensures that in any court proceedings the interests of the child will be paramount.  Such a move should bring about a greater focus on these issues through our child care policies.</p><p>  The baby Ann case saw the Supreme Court rule in favour of a child's natural parents even though baby Ann had been given up for adoption by them two years previously.  This was in recognition of the special protection given to parents in the Constitution, yet there was no individual protection afforded to Ann, the child at the centre of the case.  The amendment will provide that the rights and protections enjoyed by children are to be enjoyed by all children irrespective of their parents' marital status.</p><p>  The Roscommon incest and abuse case, in which the married parents of a large family sexually abused their children for more than a decade, was another stark example of failure by the State and its legal architecture to protect children.  In this case the children's mother was able to secure a High Court order preventing a local health board from taking the children into care. Consequently, the children stayed with their abusers for many more years than they should have.  Constitutional guidance gave priority to the marital family.  This type of failure would be prevented by this constitutional amendment.</p><p>  I could go on.  In all, there are 17 major reports on gross child protection failings - 17 tragedies in which vulnerable children suffered abuse and neglect.  To echo what the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, said yesterday, we are at last being informed by the bitter lessons of the past.  We have learned from the dark history of our past when children's interests were ignored.  The proposed constitutional amendment will provide the legal tools to ensure these gross failings cannot happen again.  Our country will be constitutionally bound to treat future generations fairly and equally and with their best interests at the very centre of decision making.  Article 42A is an important step in strengthening the protection of all children in the State.  It is a most welcome development, identifying children as much more than the property of their parents or the State.  They are included in our society as children in their own right - vulnerable individuals who enjoy security and protection as an inherent right.</p></speech>

We had just come out from under British occupation, we had many Victorian values and we had a different, imposed legal system.</p><p>The past 70 years in this State have seen a seismic shift in attitudes, particularly towards marginal sections of society.  As a people, we have moved away from Victorian thinking towards more open and liberal attitudes as to how citizens should be treated.  Up to quite recently, societal thinking on children could be best summed up by the phrase &quot;Children should be seen but not heard.&quot;  This has changed and society now genuinely seeks the best welfare of the children of the nation.  This is partly because children are vulnerable and require protection, but in the context of resources it is also because we recognise our children are the greatest possible investment we can make for the future.  Also, the needs of children have changed since the Constitution was written.  Change has come about for these reasons and because of the examples of cases where children were abused in their homes and institutions and the State, for whatever reason, was powerless to act effectively.</p><p><br /> I remember reading newspapers and listening to comment on some of the more horrific cases of child abuse in family homes.  I was angry as a citizen that in my name the State had failed those vulnerable children.  I remember feeling a sense of frustration that the Government, which was acting on my behalf and on behalf of the nation, could not get its act together and do the right thing by children.  I hope no Irish person will ever have to go through such frustration and anger, because the State was no good to children who were abused.  The State should have been there <i>in loco parenti</i>s to ensure the right thing was done for those children, but the State let them and the nation down.  It should have made a resolution then that this hurt could never happen again.</p><p><br /> This is what makes this referendum so important and I commend the Minister and the Department on bringing it forward.  Some people will criticise it and many will think it goes too far and that an evil state exists to remove children from good parents.  However, there will be safeguards within the legislation.  There have been examples, particularly in Britain, of where social services went totally overboard and misunderstood communications between social workers and children, whether this was a result of inadequate social work education or policy.  Fundamental mistakes were made there which were very painful for parents and damaging to children.  Therefore, the policies we put in place must be tight because the last thing we want is for the social workers intervening to protect the child to instead damage the interest of the child.  We cannot and will not tolerate that.</p><p><br /> We need to modernise the Constitution to reflect the realities as they are today.  Constitutional reform is necessary so that we, as a Government and society, can affirm children as full citizens of the State, with rights both within the family unit and where necessary separate from the family unit.  Under the current Constitution, children enjoy the same rights as all citizens, but this does not reflect the fact that the needs of children are vastly different from those of adults.  Currently, there is no special status for children in the Constitution.  They are practically invisible in it.  What may be interpreted from the Constitution is that the rights of the family may supersede the rights of children, as pointed out by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, the chairperson of the Kilkenny incest investigation, a long time ago.  This needs to be rectified and that is the reason this amendment is necessary.  If anybody questions the necessity for the amendment, the Kilkenny investigation demonstrates simply a good, painful example of the need for it.</p><p><br /> The referendum, if passed, will give children rights within the Constitution for the first time.  Article 42(A).1 will state: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  This is the first time the State will acknowledge the rights of children as individuals with constitutional rights.  Sinn FÃ©in will propose an amendment to this to include the word &quot;equally&quot;.  I know the Minister would not want any unintended discrimination against children here, whether based on class, gender, creed or race and therefore we will propose this amendment.</p><p><br /> Article 42(A).2 and 3 will aim to rectify the double standards that in the past prevented agencies from intervening in a family case where a child was at risk, or where agencies were involved, did not provide them with the policies and the rights to make a difference to the rights of those children.  An example of this is to be seen in the Roscommon abuse case.  Due to the constitutional position of the marital family under Irish law, a higher risk threshold must be reached before the State can intervene when a child is at risk.  Furthermore, a child of a marital family generally, may not be adopted, even if in the care of the State for the whole of its life.  It is legally possible to provide for adoption under the Constitution, but it is very difficult to do and rarely happens due to the legal difficulties.</p><p><br /> I disagree with those who say the family will lose some of the protection afforded by the Constitution.</p></speech>

The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.  It is anticipated the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session.  It is my intention that the child and family support agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in January 2013.  The final report of the task force that I established to advise on the necessary transition programme to establish a child and family support agency made recommendations on a number of key issues, including the range of services which, in the opinion of the task force, should fall within the remit of the new agency.  These recommendations are being given detailed consideration by me and my Department in preparation for the establishment of the new agency.</p><p><br />  The new agency, which will assume responsibility for children and family services that are currently provided by the HSE and the Family Support Agency, will be a dedicated agency with a sole focus.  It will have approximately 4,000 staff and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million.  The agency will be headed by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, as the chief executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team.  The recruitment of this team is at an advanced stage.  This is at the heart of our programme of reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key child and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms that are already under way under the national director for children and families, Mr. Jeyes.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements, including the continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of these services.  I have spoken on a number of occasions in this House about the lack of consistency in approach when families throughout the country look for services.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The reform programme also provides for the introduction of legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis; the establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services in order to bring transparency and accountability to the use of resources to meet national priorities; the transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new agency, the merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over &#8364;26 million into the child and family support agency and the consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new agency.  At the heart of the new agency will be a new service delivery framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases so that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support.  The new agency will represent the practical application of a new approach towards proportionate service responses, an approach which is central to the constitutional amendment on child protection which will be put before the people on 10 November.</p></reply>

I welcome her continued commitment to this agency.  I ask her to clarify exactly when she hopes the legislation will be in place.  As she knows, the timeframe between now and the end of the year is very tight.  If she wishes to have the new agency up and running by January, she will have to bring legislation before the Oireachtas soon.  The Minister will agree that early intervention is crucial.  It is important to ensure there is early intervention in cases of child neglect.  Will there be any additional recruitment for the new agency?  How many staff have been transferred from other Departments so far?  I presume this process has already started so that the January deadline can be met.</p></speech>

We have established a shadow agency - an agency within an agency, in effect - within the HSE.  Mr. Jeyes has been managing that process over the last year.  We have reduced the number of managers from 34 to 16.  We have provided for more direct accountability to Mr. Jeyes as manager.  Those on the front line are now in much closer contact with their managers.  The 4,000 staff will include staff from the child care and residential sectors and the Family Support Agency.  A great deal of work has been done in the HSE to identify those members of staff who will fall within the remit of the new agency.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for services like the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board, youth services and adoption and fostering services.  Ongoing work is being done to identify the point at which other services might make the transition to the new agency.  As the Deputy knows, the task force made a wide series of recommendations in its report.  The new agency will be established and will be dealing with its core services by January 2013.  Certain other services will move into the agency in the medium to longer term.  It will depend on the outcome of the analysis and the decisions to be made by the Government.  Ms Joan Carmichael of the IMPACT trade union is working as an independent chair to help staff to make the change.  I welcome the broad support I have received across the sector as I have overseen the transition to the new agency.</p></speech>

She mentioned that the agency will be answerable to its new director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  Will it be directly answerable to the Minister of the day?  Political accountability is crucial in this regard.  I raised this issue when the Minister launched the agency earlier in the summer.  Given that the HSE is disbanding its current governance structure, it is regrettable that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is seeking to develop a similar structure in this instance.  The Minister has said that the new agency will have a budget of approximately â¬590 million per annum.  Will the new agency start with a clean bill of health?  I hope that a deficit will not have to be carried by the new agency as it begins its work.  That would not be a welcome move.</p></speech>

The Government has yet to make a decision on the exact model of governance for the agency.  Obviously, that will form part of the legislation, which will be brought to the DÃ¡il before December.  The Deputy will be aware that the task force which examined the various forms of governance in operation among international child protection services was strongly of the view that the agency should have an independent board, especially in light of the nature of its child protection work.  I have not made a decision on that yet.  The agency will certainly be accountable to me as Minister.  Of course there will be political accountability.  The Deputy also asked about the starting budget.  I hope the agency will start its work in a strong budgetary position.  We are all familiar with the economic situation and the financial pressures that are faced by all services at present.  Members will appreciate that there are big demands on these services.  The HSE child and family budget and my Department's budget both increased last year.  I hope the agency will start its work in a strong budgetary position.  I will work to that end.</p></speech>

If it forms such a view, it is required to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.  Under the 1995 child care regulations , the HSE is required to consider a child's need for assistance, in accordance with the provisions of section 45, two years prior to the child leaving care.  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.</p><p>The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years on the basis of a need for assistance.</p><p><br /> As I have previously advised the Deputy, regular statistics for young adults in receipt of aftercare only commenced being compiled and published by the HSE after I took office in 2011.  I am now receiving quarterly reports on the numbers leaving aftercare; therefore, we now have more up-to-date figures than were previously available.  I believe I supplied the Deputy with figures for the years 2007 to 2010, inclusive.  As of June 2012, the statistics indicate that 1,053 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service.  As I told the Deputy previously, the budgets for aftercare provision across the country have increased substantially.  While regular figures were not available before 2011, we are aware that the number of children in aftercare has increased, for example, from 847 in 2009 to 1,053 in June 2012.  I will be getting new figures at the end of September.  I have asked the HSE if it can compile the precise information requested by the Deputy for the seven year period.  Although I do not have that information available today, I will try to get it.  We have given all the data we have available.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p><br /> The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation, as well as further education, employment or training and social support.  The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those who are not in education and training and those who have left residential care.  Young people with mental health problems or a disability are also in need of particular support.  Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance, networks and practical support.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element in achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.</p><p><br /> Some 90% of children in care are in foster care, a large number of whom remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age.  Many of these young people continue in education and training, as planned.  This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care.</p><p><br /> The HSE national aftercare service is underpinned by a national policy and procedures document which has been developed in co-operation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department.  The policy which was finalised in April 2011 commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and ensuring consistency of support for these young people.  The HSE has established an intra-agency national aftercare implementation group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.  The work of this group is ongoing and I have asked Mr. Gordon Jeyes, national director for children and family services in the HSE, to prepare a report on aftercare. This report will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the key findings of the group, examples of best practice, assessment criteria and effective aftercare supports.  The report will guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area. </p><p><br /> The Deputy will be aware that I am examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation to make explicit the HSE's obligations in the provision of aftercare.  The experience in implementing the national aftercare policies and procedures and the involvement of a range of important stakeholders in this process provide an opportunity to further improve policy and legislation in this area.</p></reply>

I remain hugely concerned, which is why I continue to raise it with her.  For her information, the last time she responded with figures up to the end of May 2012, the figure was 1,310.  There needs to be a revisitation of the June figure as it could hardly have dropped so dramatically to 1,053.  I am concerned about the process of establishing the figures.</p><p>  Young adults 18 years and older need continuing support, particularly in these harsh economic times.  As a parent of young adults, I am keenly aware of this, as many in this institution will affirm.  As a substitute for birth parents, the State should treat those in our collective care no differently, which would be my certain wish.  We must continue to protect vulnerable young people and our duty of care does not cease on their attaining their 18th birthday.</p><p>  With all that has been exposed in recent reports, by which we are all deeply shocked, it is vital - I remake the case - to ensure a legal right to aftercare is included in the Statute Book to avoid future tragedies.  The Child Care Act, as it stands, could be described as a hollow guarantee without including this legal right.  There must be investment to ensure there will be sufficient resources in place to provide aftercare for all young people who require it.</p><p>  I understand from previous responses that the Minister indicated ten additional dedicated aftercare workers would be recruited.  Has she filled these additional posts yet?  I understand there were already 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE.  Does the Minister accept the HSE's indication that aftercare must be provided according to needs and based on a needs assessment?  Will she indicate how child or young adult friendly is this assessment?  Are all young people being assessed post-care?</p></speech>

I share his view of the vulnerability of young people leaving care.  We had the figure in 2010 of 2,000 young people leaving care.  There is no question that there have been developments since, although I am not complacent about the matter.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on the number of aftercare staff who have been recruited, but it is my understanding the recruitment did go ahead.  I will confirm this for the Deputy.</p><p>  There is now a national policy on aftercare, as the Deputy knows, and there has also been the very positive development of the establishment of the intra-agency national aftercare implementation group, of which EPIC, the group which works with young people to ensure their perspectives are taken into account, is part.  The HSE has issued a directive that young people due to leave care be assessed.</p><p>  I also said I would examine the legislation.  When I bring forward the legislation to establish the new agency, I hope to bring forward within it a more explicit statement of the HSE's obligation in regard to aftercare.  As the Deputy knows, my advice from the Attorney General, as well as my legal advice, has been that there is already a statutory obligation, but I will make it more explicit in view of the seriousness and importance of the issue.  I expect to be able to include this in the legislation establishing the new agency in order that it will be very clear that it has the responsibility  I will revert to the Deputy with the figures sought.</p></speech>

To what extent is she prepared to move in terms of the new legislative provision?  There are 100 young people leaving aftercare on an annual basis - perhaps the figure is even greater than this - and the number will continue to rise as more and more are catered for within the care system.  Greater resources will be required into the future and it is essential we put them in place.  Again, on the basis of the equality core value, those of us who are parents know that young adults continue to require our support.  We should continue to treat children in our care no differently.</p></speech>

There has clearly been a change in terms of the awareness of the needs of this group.  Of course, it is important to point out that not every young person leaving care will be in need of aftercare.  Some will obviously not want it or will just want to do their own thing and move on.  There will also be quite a number of young people in the care system who will turn 18 and remain with foster families.</p><p>  The Deputy's question points to the need for even more careful analysis of the figures.  As I said - this is an issue I have had to confront across a number of areas - we need better quality information on precisely what is happening to young people who leave the care system.  We are beginning to get this information.  We are also beginning to see increased budgets and provision.  Given the vulnerability of some young people in aftercare, as we saw in recent reports, we have to ensure we provide the very best quality service we can in order to help them make that transition from care.</p></speech>

My Department works in close partnership with other Departments on a range of cross-cutting issues in regard to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people.  I also point to the fact that my Department is in the process of developing a new children and young people's policy framework and that it is intended this overarching policy document will provide a seamless, whole-of-childhood approach to policy-making, including budgetary decision-making, for children and young people across the whole of government in the period 2013-18.</p><p>  As regards the published 2012 Estimates for my Department, the Deputy might note that the full gross allocation for 2012 stands at just under â¬427 million, of which â¬418 million relates to current funding and the remainder to capital funding.  Given the number of key priorities facing my Department which include establishing the new Child and Family Support Agency, holding a constitutional referendum on children's rights and the continued provision of the free preschool year in early childhood care and education, the resource allocation represents a 2% increase in funding when compared to the Estimates outturn of â¬419 million for 2011.</p><p>That shows the priority attached to the delivery of the programmes which come under my own Department.  I was very pleased to obtain capital funding of â¬6 million towards child care this year.  The Deputy will also be aware of the money that has been agreed and given by the Government so that we can take children out of St. Patrick's Institution.  The capital fund for that is quite substantial.</p><p> With regard to my own direct remit, the Deputy will be aware of the child and family support programme, which includes funding for the Family Support Agency, the National Education Welfare Board, the school completion programme and child detention centres.  With regard to early childhood, we have the free preschool year, and we also support a range of programmes including the national longitudinal study of children in Ireland, the national children's strategy, the lottery funding scheme, provision for the Ombudsman for Children, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the constitutional referendum on children's rights, which will take place next month.  That summarises the range of resources in my Department.</p></reply>

I am trying to work out the wider departmental position and do not want to engage in a debate about the budget itself.  Every time I wish to pose a question I must ask myself whether it should be directed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills or some other Minister.  Children are represented in almost every single Department.</p><p>  In terms of children's issues, we are seeing things pushed to the limit and we have measurement by failure.  Recently I have been made aware of a transport problem at St. Raphael's special school, the removal of the dental service for primary school children in my constituency and the fact that developmental clinics for babies are being seriously cut back, to give but a few examples.  During last week's debate about the Department of Health, the filling of vacant positions in areas such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy was raised.  There may well be two priorities in that Department but children are the big losers due to the lack of such services.</p><p>  I am trying to understand whether the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs sits at the Cabinet table as an advocate.  Does she analyse what each Department is doing from the point of view of children?  Does she examine the failures that occur, such as the curtailing of developmental clinics for babies, which is pretty serious?  What approach does the Minister take where she sees such failures, and is there a proactive approach on the delivery side?</p></speech>

Another way of looking at that is to ask how we should organise our services so that we get the best delivery for children.  If the Deputy has not read the task force report on child and family services and how they should operate under the new agency, I would recommend that she do so.  The report argues that the way we organise our services is not as friendly to children and families as it needs to be.  It recommends that we try to deliver services to customers in a customer-friendly way so that they can readily access the services they need.  There is an issue with regard to the structural organisation of some of our services.</p><p>  In response to the point raised by the Deputy, there is clearly a whole-of-government responsibility to children.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have very specific responsibilities in the areas I outlined earlier, but some issues are cross-departmental.  The issue of developmental clinics referred to by the Deputy, for example,  is something about which I would be very concerned.  As a member of the Government, I share in the collective responsibility when it comes to making decisions on budgetary matters and matters that affect children.  I am engaged in detailed discussions with other Cabinet colleagues, through Cabinet sub-committees and through quite a number of inter-departmental working groups on an ongoing basis to ensure better delivery of services.  I am also engaged in regular bilateral meetings, such as those currently taking place with the Department of Social Protection on child care services.   </p><p>  There are two answers to the Deputy's question.  One relates to how we actually deliver the services at present, what Departments they are organised under and how seamless the services should be.  The second relates to the fact that there is a whole-of-government responsibility in terms of child-proofing policies and decisions.  The concept of equality-proofing was accepted some time ago but that still has a long way to go.  The Government must be sensitive to the cumulative impact of decisions on children and families.  I have a particular responsibility to interact with other Ministers in that context.</p></speech>

It is more reflective of the fact that children have an entitlement to services.  Will the Child and Family Support Agency be responsible to the Minister in the same way that the HSE is responsible to the Minister for Health?  It will be very difficult to maintain proper scrutiny if the agency is at arms length or outsourced, so to speak.  As members of the Opposition we are supposed to hold the Government to account but, in the case of the HSE, for example, it is really difficult for us to figure out how services are run.  It can take ages to receive replies to questions and so forth.  How does the Minister anticipate the agency will work?  That will be critical if we are to move towards a different model of service delivery.</p></speech>

The governance of the new agency will form part of that legislation when it is presented for debate before December.  The Government has yet to take some decisions regarding the new agency.  In response to the question of accountability that the Deputy raises, it will be far easier to achieve accountability with an agency that is dedicated to this area with a sole focus, as opposed to being part of a large organisation such as the HSE.  In the latter organisation, managers have multiple jobs and multiple focuses.  As I said in an earlier reply, we have reduced the number of managers from 34 to 16 and there is much clearer accountability.  It is much closer from the front line to management.  Gordon Jeyes has made the point repeatedly that accountability is essential.  There will be clearer political and front-line accountability because we will not have several layers of management in the new agency.  The governance structure will form part of the legislation that I will bring before the House in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

International evidence shows that early intervention can improve outcomes for children and families, particularly with regard to emotional, cognitive and social development.  However, child care takes many forms, consisting not only of early years interventions but also of services such as after-school care for school-aged children.  Child care is used by families in many different ways.</p><p>  With the exception of a small number of nurseries subsidised by the HSE and preschools funded by the Department of Education and Skills, the State does not operate child care and play school services.  Child care services are generally operated as either commercial or community not-for-profit concerns.  Child care costs are dictated by the costs for service providers and by the market.  According to a survey of child care providers carried out by Pobal in 2011, the average cost of a full-time child care place is â¬165 per week, with the cost of a place for a younger baby approximately â¬10 above that.  However, prices vary across the country.  </p><p>  I appreciate the point the Deputy makes that child care costs continue to be a significant challenge and burden for many families.</p><p>I also appreciate that the child care costs for parents in this country are high relative to other countries.  That has been commented upon in various reports in the past decade, including by the OECD.  The Government does support a number of child care programmes through the provision of the three separate child care support programmes: the community childcare subvention, CCS, programme.  I have seen examples all around the country of the support the programme gives to local families in the community: the childcare education and training support, CETS, scheme which helps where parents are involved in education and training, and the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme which funds the universal free preschool year.  These programmes are administered by my Department.</p><p><br /> We are lucky to have 94% of young children who are eligible benefitting from the universal free preschool year, which is available to all three to four year olds in the country.  I commend the work of my predecessor in introducing the scheme when the early child care payment was abolished by the previous Government.</p><p><i> Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>Protecting and, if possible, further developing the universal free preschool scheme has been a key priority for me and the Department.  In last December&#8217;s budget I secured an additional &#8364;9.8 million in funding to maintain the universal free year which has seen an increase of approximately 3,000 in the number of children participating in the programme.  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on the three child care programmes is expected to exceed &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and these schemes represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of child care.</p></reply>

She cannot simply wash her hands and say markets dictate the cost of child care.  It is too big an issue.  The Minister correctly outlined the various figures that have been bandied about on the cost of child care.  It costs up to â¬1,100 a month in parts of Dublin for child care.  The cost is restricting the ability of people to return to the workplace.  It is more expensive than the average monthly mortgage and something must be done about it.  A significant amount of money was invested in community child care facilities in recent years.  We should consider providing more community facilities because they provide greater affordability of care.  At the same time community child care facilities are being attacked by the savage cuts to the community employment schemes.  I am a board member of a community child care facility.  Without the community employment scheme workers on the staff it would not be possible to continue in existence.  I urge the Minister to examine the issue seriously.  We must bring about a situation whereby child care in this country is affordable.  The cost of child care in this country is one of the highest in the OECD.  That is not acceptable and something must be done to address it.  The Minister could consider splitting maternity leave between parents.  We must be innovative in how we approach the issue to ensure that we reduce the cost of child care because it is unsustainable.</p></speech>

I have worked over many years to ensure that parents have proper child care available to them.  What has happened in this country in the past ten years is that instead of delivering a universal free service the money was put into, for example, the child care supplement, which was then withdrawn.  A total of â¬1.2 billion was withdrawn from that payment but it was put into the ECCE scheme.  We have tended to focus on direct cash payments to parents rather than developing the kind of service Deputy Troy says ought to exist.  I would like to have seen such a system being developed in recent years but it was not and now parents are paying the price of commercial rates which are very high.  I agree with Deputy Troy that they are like a mortgage for many parents.  I fully understand the situation parents face.  It is extraordinarily difficult for families and makes it extremely difficult for many families who want to avail of those services to combine work and family life.</p><p>  As Deputy Troy indicated, there are 950 community services throughout the country.  They have been built up in recent years and they are participating in the CCS programme all over the country from which 25,000 children benefit, in addition to 90% of three to four year olds.  I would like to see a second ECCE year.  I would like child care to be provided for all children between the ages of three and five before they go to primary school.  I would like to think that when the budgetary situation improves and we are in a position to put more money into child care that will be one of the places it will be invested.</p></speech>

What will she do to tackle it?  She is lucky and honoured enough to be Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  She has the authority to bring about changes.  What are the Minister's plans to ensure change is introduced?  We will support her and bring ideas to her.</p></speech>

I also ensured that we can continue to provide the community childcare subvention programme and the CETS programme which assist parents in education and training.  As the budgetary situation improves and finance becomes available it is one of the areas on which I would like to focus.  Currently, I am keen to ensure we maintain the current range of services.  That is why I was pleased that the budget in my Department and the part of the HSE budget that deals with child and family support services were increased by 4% at a time when many Departments face huge cutbacks.</p><p>  It is expensive for the State to provide child care.  I wish it was possible for us to do more at the moment but I want to maintain what we have and focus on quality because that matters as well in terms of the delivery of services.  We must continually examine the quality of schemes and the inspection regime.  A range of areas require attention and I am currently focused on them.</p></speech>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  A total of 6,259 children were in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care.</p><p><br />  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.  The care needs of those young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within this country.  For this small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion and in exceptional cases required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and highly specialised therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not available in this country.  This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  The HSE has a national protocol in place for such children.</p><p><br />  The HSE has advised me that as of 21 September 2012, eight young people were detained in out-of-State secure placements.  Four young people are in St. Andrews, Northampton at a cost of &#8364;12,582 per week, per child; two young people are placed in Kibble, a specialist facility in Scotland, at a cost of &#8364;6,685 per week, per child; and two young people are placed in Boystown Nebraska at a cost of &#8364;2,017 per week, per child.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The HSE ensures that these placements are suitable.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and monitored by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in the specialised units.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's national director for children and family services and my officials.</p></reply>

One of the elements in my question was to inquire about her plans to ensure that children with special care needs receive care within the State.  On the previous occasion we addressed the issue the Minister said on the record - she laid emphasis on it - "that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system."  I am concerned that such referral has become an established feature of the system.  This is an important issue.  The Minister indicated that a small number of children are affected but the cost factor week-on-week is substantial.  Do the figures the Minister cited take into account the cost of facilitating family visits and social worker visits from this jurisdiction to each of the placed children?</p><p>Does that happen?  How long have the small number of young people been in this care and what is the long-term plan for them?  These are young people but what about their further care in life as they grow older?  Has the Minister examined the cost of providing treatment here for that particular cohort of young people?  Has there been any exploration in conjunction with authorities north of the Border to examine the greater viability of providing these specialist care supports to children on a North-South basis on the island of Ireland, thereby eliminating the expensive costs of flights and all the other ancillary costs that must accrue as a result of their being placed on the neighbouring island of Britain, or as in two of the cases cited by the Minister, in the United States?</p></speech>

Other countries also send children there.  We must accept that for children with highly complex and challenging behavioural difficulties sometimes their best possible care can be provided in overseas specialist centres.  That is why we are using these services - we do not have them in this country at present.  We will certainly have looked to see if such services were available any place on the island; that would have been taken into account.  These services would have been chosen very carefully for the children involved.  Given there is such a small number of children involved, I do not wish to say anything that would identify them but suffice it to say that there are very complex care and behavioural needs involved, including emotional and sexual difficulties, and these children need very specialised care.</p><p>  That said, I have indicated previously in the House that I believe our special care facilities, high support units and detention services in this country represent an area that needs attention.  We need more clarity in regard to how this care should develop in the future.  I have met with the relevant people and have an examination under way at present of how we are organising those services because I am not satisfied with the organisation or national planning in their regard.  I believe the people on the front line are doing a very good job, as well as they can do it, but in terms of policy direction and future development of those services the work has simply not been done and it needs to be done.  We have to see the referral of those children in that context.  We do not have the services for them in this country.  Perhaps for some of them we will be able to provide those services in the future.</p><p> I assure the Deputy the costs are per week in the unit so this does not include the various observations he made in regard to other costs.   I assure him also that the social workers are in contact with those children and the services are in constant contact with the providers.  We have experience of children doing extremely well in these units, and returning back to Ireland and doing well, either independently or with their families.</p></speech>

Rather we are talking about particular care settings in regard to very complex cases.  It is not just about specific procedures.  The instances the Minister cited are placements for care needs and supports that are not currently within our system.  Has any serious assessment has been given, even a rough, off the top of the head kind, of the total costs, apart from those of family visits?  The Minister has not clarified whether social workers from this jurisdiction visit these children in their overseas placements.  One is talking about in the order of in excess of â¬400,000 per annum for some of those individual children, which is substantial money.  Will she clarify whether an assessment has been done as to the potential of providing that care support on the island of Ireland?  We might not be talking about eight cases but a smaller number, and perhaps collectively we might be able to ensure those facilities here,  which would be more easily accessible to families and all others who have a role to play.</p></speech>

What these young people are receiving is not simply residential care.  The reason I compared it to Great Ormond Street is that they are getting the kind of treatments and care and psychological interventions that are simply not available to them here.  I assure the Deputy the social workers are in contact with the children and do visit them.  The reason these services are being used is that, having assessed what is available in Ireland, the kind of specialist help these young people need, in the residential care settings such as they are being sent to, is just not available here.  I assure the Deputy that as part of my work in regard to high support and special care, the question of whatever specialist services we can provide in Ireland will clearly form part of that.  Right now, however, we do not have these services in the country.</p></speech>

When the third optional protocol to the convention was opened for signature by member states in February 2012, I announced that it was my intention to sign the protocol on behalf of Ireland as soon as possible.  My Department is currently finalising the State&#8217;s combined third and fourth reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and a full update on the position in regard to the signature of the protocol will be given in that report.  This is the first report to be submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in over five years.</p><p><br />  Due to the wide-ranging nature of the convention it has been necessary to consult with all Departments in regard to both the preparation of the new report as well as the new optional protocol.  This is to enable full consideration to be given to the implications of signature.  Once the report is finalised and submitted to the UN committee it would be my intention to sign the third optional protocol in due course on behalf of Ireland.  Ratification would generally take place some time after that, once the State is satisfied that the necessary legislative and administrative procedures are in place to enable full compliance.  This matter will be assessed by the legal unit of my Department in due course.</p><p><br />  Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the second optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and it is my stated intention to progress to ratification in due course, once I am satisfied that the State will be able to meet all its obligations therein.  I recently discussed the issue of ratification of this protocol in a meeting with the UN special representative on violence against children, which took place in my Department on 11 June last, during the special representative's official visit to Ireland.  We agreed that the matter would be prioritised in due course following completion of my Department<font color="#FF0000">&#8217;</font>s current work on the upcoming children's referendum, the submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p><br />  Many of the criminal law provisions of the optional protocol to the Convention have already been implemented in existing domestic legislation.  Legislative proposals that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring to Government in the coming months will, I understand, facilitate compliance with the criminal law requirements of the optional protocol and other international related legal instruments.  It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, it is proposed to ratify the optional protocol and related international legal instruments as soon as is practicable.  It would be my intention in due course to bring a joint memorandum to Government, with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to enable Ireland to ratify the second optional protocol, which has been signed by Ireland.</p></reply>

In explanation, the communications protocol gives an assurance policy, so to speak, for children.  In the short space of time the Minister has been in office, she and her Department has been doing a great deal to wipe away the history we have had of neglect of children.  However, there may come a time in the future history of our State where we will once again neglect children and their rights.  This protocol gives an international insurance policy for children and their advocates to appeal to the United Nations and have those rights vindicated.</p><p>We have not yet signed it.  The Minister has stated clearly to the House that she intends to sign it, which is to be welcomed, but the question is on the time line.  I understand she is in a particularly busy period and the amount of legislation she is dealing with is impressive.  The children's rights referendum is coming up.  Hers is a particularly busy Department and it is also a fairly new one, but the signing of the protocol would mean a great deal in that we would be meeting not just our domestic obligations to children but our obligations on the international stage also.  We now have a chance, given the way children have been treated in the past, to be a shining light internationally.  The signing of the protocol as soon as we possibly can would ensure this.  Can the Minister give a specific time line in that regard and also for ratification of the second one about which I have asked?</p></speech>

It is on our agenda.  We intend to ratify the second protocol as quickly as we can and move to the third one.  I would think we will be in a position to do this in the coming months.  On the second protocol, I am waiting for some legislation on which the Department of Justice and Equality is working.  I will bring a memorandum to the Government on it with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Further legislation is being prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality to strengthen the protection of children from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and facilitate full compliance with the relevant international legal instruments.  Once that is done, it should clear the way for ratification of the second protocol.  As regards the third one, I will be working on the report on the rights of the child shortly.  An amount of work is being done on it in my Department and I am aware it requires that we liaise with other Departments to get their responses to what is included in the protocol.</p></speech>

I strongly believe it is.</p><p>  Regarding the second protocol referred to on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, indicated here in July that he expected to bring legislative proposals to the Government in the coming months.

I did not get to make a number of points in reply on the back-drop to the establishment of the agency and the other issues we need to pursue as we establish it.  One I have mentioned is the consistency of the child protection services in that the assessments and responses families receive will be similar throughout the country.  Another back-drop includes the legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis, the provision of a dedicated budget for the child and family support agency and the transition of the child protection and welfare services to the new agency.  The Family Support Agency will merge with the new agency and its budget of â¬26 million will form part of the budget of the child and family support agency.</p></reply>

The Minister stated in her earlier reply that the core services would be transferred by January 2013.  In correspondence to me she might indicate the core services that are to be transferred and indicate a timeframe for the transfer of the remaining services.  It is welcome that the governance structure has not been fully agreed to by the Government and that we will have an opportunity to debate it as the legislation proceeds through the House.</p><p>  The Minister has said she hopes the agency will start with a strong budget.  I hope, given that it will be a new agency, that it will not start with a deficit.  This is a new agency which will do good work and there should not be an overhang in its budget, as it did not have an opportunity to exert influence heretofore.</p></speech>

We will have an opportunity to discuss that issue when I bring the legislation to the House.</p><p><br />  The core services consist of the child and family support services in the Health Service Executive, and the work done by the Family Support Agency and the education and welfare services.  On the areas that must have a strong relationship with the child and family support agency - some of them should be directly under it - I am not sure what the transition point might be for them, but going on the very good work done by the task force we should examine, for example, some public health nursing services that could come directly under the new agency, although not all of them.  I envisage public health nurses remaining where they are at present, but I would like to see strong interaction because many of them have direct contact with families.  Speech and language therapy services, child and adolescent mental health services, Garda youth diversion projects and the psychology services were examined in the task force report.  As I stated in reply to Deputy Murphy, we need to examine the organisation of some of these services and how they can best deliver to the families who need them.</p></speech>

I have every confidence that this is a priority for her, but when does she expect to be in a position to announce an exact date for the commencement of the agency's functions?  In terms of core responsibilities, is it the case that she expects various other roles and responsibilities to be accredited to the agency over a period of time?  Over what period does she expect these roles and responsibilities to be transferred?</p></speech>

I am confident, having spoken to people on the ground, that this will be the case.  In my area there has been a transfer from the HSE.  I also see, however, that in Bishopstown an issue has arisen.  It is important, therefore, that we have a seamless transfer and that there are clear lines of demarcation and responsibility.  This is a great opportunity, about which we should not be negative; rather we should be positive about it.</p></speech>

We will have work to do in the DÃ¡il in advance of that date, but we have said all along that the agency will begin as a separate entity from 1 January 2013.  It should progress, depending on the introduction of legislation in the House and the making of decisions on the governance structure and its development.</p><p> It is clear that the core services to which I referred earlier when replying to Deputy Troy will be transferred to the new agency in the first instance.  I will be bringing a memo to Government in respect of this matter shortly in order that we might discuss the findings and recommendations contained in the report of the task force.  Some of the recommendations have implications in the context of the way in which services are delivered.  As a result of the fact that a number of Departments will be involved, the Government as a whole will be obliged to make a decision on this matter.  There is not yet an exact timeframe with regard to the transfer of some other services.  However, it is important that the services which will be available from the new agency will be those which families need and use and which are of most benefit to them.  It will, of course, be a matter of developing strong links to certain services rather than moving them directly into the agency.  The task force has pointed out that there are certain key services which it is not planned to bring under the remit of the new agency but which ought to be under its direct control.  We will be able to discuss that matter when the legislation is introduced.</p></speech>

This protocol is designed to formalise cross-border information-sharing practice when agencies learn that families of children at risk are moving, or have moved, across the Border, thereby ensuring that children and families moving between the two jurisdictions will receive the care and protection they need in a timely and appropriate manner.  The protocol represents a collaborative approach to best practice, with the aim of allowing the agencies to assess and manage risk in respect of children and families that move into their respective jurisdictions.</p><p>  Information relating to children who are in care, who are on the child protection register or in respect of whom there is a level of concern and who move between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be shared between the statutory authorities in both jurisdictions.  This will allow for a greater focus on those children at risk through enhanced information sharing.  The latter will permit better assessments to be carried out in respect of each specific childâs needs and circumstances.</p><p>  The protocol is available to download from relevant departmental websites.  It represents a very positive and practical outcome from the co-operation on child protection which is overseen by the North-South Ministerial Council and which is being taken forward by my Department and officials in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.  This matter has been on the agenda at quite a number of the meetings of the council at which I have been in attendance.  There has been extremely good co-operation in respect of best practice with regard to information sharing in order to ensure that children at risk will be assisted in an effective manner within both jurisdictions.</p></reply>

I welcome its introduction.  It is extremely important that this practical area of understanding and addressing mutual problems should be part and parcel of normal political life across the island of Ireland.  The protocol is going to be of assistance in terms of building levels of ongoing co-operation between the respective authorities North and South.</p><p>  How will the protocol operate in the context of the establishment of the new child and family support agency, which was the subject of the previous question, on 1 January next?  The protocol is, of course, just a statement of shared intent and outlook in respect of specific issues that present.  Does the potential exist to move on from the protocol and take a further step of co-operation on a new level and not only in respect of matters relating to child protection?  In other words, will it be possible to foster co-operation and information sharing with regard to those who constitute a risk to children?  At present, there is a significant deficiency in the context of the position relating to the Six Counties and that of this State.</p></speech>

The relevant front-line staff are aware of its existence and when families are moving between the two jurisdictions, information sharing is actually taking place.</p><p>  The Deputy's point in respect of the North-South Ministerial Conference and the potential to develop our work in this area is relevant.  We are considering a number of areas in respect of which information can be exchanged.  One of the new work streams relates to examining the death of children in care in both jurisdictions and discovering the lessons we might learn and share in this regard.  We are also considering what constitutes best practice in the context of safeguarding children generally.  The Deputy referred earlier to specialist services and we are examining ways to provide these on a cross-Border basis in order to assist in meeting the needs of children and families in circumstances where a high volume of expertise is required.  That matter is being jointly examined by the authorities in the two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In that regard, research indicates that some 25% of three year olds are either obese or overweight.</p><p>  National play and recreation policies are implemented by local authorities.  Many of the latter have developed world-class recreational facilities and integrated play plans which benefit thousands of children.  I am, from the point of view of my Department's remit, trying to encourage a joined-up approach to the development and use of the extensive range of facilities available throughout the country.  In February I established the first ever national local authority play and recreation network, which brings together key personnel responsible for local authorities' play and recreation policies.  It was extremely interesting to meet staff from the various local authorities and watch them sharing their experiences in the context of developing facilities for children and local communities and learning from each other.  That is the benefit of the network.</p><p>  To date, the network has taken initiatives to promote and expand national play day and national recreation week.  Deputies will be aware that when specific activities are arranged for children and families, thousands of people attend.  I witnessed thousands of families availing of facilities in Corkagh Park in my constituency when a little bit more was done to try to attract them by providing a range of activities in particular weeks.  The network aims to improve co-ordination between local authorities and to provide training and share information in order to facilitate the development of staff expertise.  For example, this year some 25 local authorities participated this year in national play day and the events surrounding it.  This placed a focus on the kind of activities with which families need to be provided.  Plans in train for national recreation week 2012, which will be held at the end of October.</p></reply>

It is heartening that 25 local authorities have participated in the national play day initiative.  I hope the Minister will make this initiative compulsory in order that all local authorities will become involved with it.  The committee of which Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in and I are members is dealing with the issue of obesity.  In that context, it is imperative to highlight the fact that access to play and recreational facilities, particularly those provided by local authorities, has major benefits from the point of view of promoting healthy lifestyles and developing children's self-esteem and their sense of self-identity.  It also has economic benefits which can help to reduce the State's expenditure on health and ensure that health care facilities will no longer be clogged up with unfit people.</p><p>We have taken a step in the right direction.  It must be incumbent on local authorities and developers to provide play areas in new estates. There needs to be a joined up approach.  This is a very important piece of work which will have long-term positive advantages for our nation.</p></speech>

There is now a much greater awareness of the benefits of such facilities on the part of local authorities.  As Deputy Buttimer said, there is a need for joined up thinking on this matter.  There is a need to focus on this area and all Deputies can play a part in this regard by highlighting why these services and facilities are so essential for children and families.  Local authorities have an important role in providing these facilities.</p><p>  The establishment of the network has been important because some local authorities are doing more than others.  There is certainly room for a national initiative to develop this kind of play and recreational facilities.  Deputy Buttimer is a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and he will be aware of the research on the serious health problems of very young children.  We need to ensure a variety of interventions are in place to interrupt that trend.  If not, there will be significant implications for the national health policy and for the children themselves.</p></speech>

However, will the Minister agree that it was a significant error that during the boom times we did not make it mandatory for local authorities and developers when they were creating vast estates in urban Ireland in particular not to include playgrounds and recreational facilities as part of any development?  We allowed developers to run amok in parts of Cork city and Dublin city.  They did not acknowledge the need for facilities to allow for recreation and leisure and to promote the health and well-being of the residents.  Even at this time of economic recession when developers are not as plentiful as they were, I hope the Minister and her colleagues in government will learn from the mistakes of the past and make plans to provide a healthy lifestyle for all our citizens.</p></speech>

This is a pilot project for assessing and improving physical fitness among Irish primary school students and also the Department of Education and Skills' active school flag programme, which is the promotion of physical fitness in Irish primary and secondary schools.  I have seen in schools in my local area the value of that programme.  Schools win flags for environmental initiatives but this is an initiative to encourage greater physical activity among schoolchildren.  The active school flag campaign is a positive initiative on the part of the Department of Education and Skills.  More schools throughout the country are becoming involved in the programme.  I also refer to SÃºgradh Ireland which is a registered charitable organisation.

I welcomed the statement by the Minister, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn, of his intention to look at the issue of patronage for the primary sector.  I thought it was high time that someone got to grips with this issue as I believe the great mix and diversity, which makes up Irish society, is not currently reflected in our school system.  Educate Together is a relatively recent addition to the short list of patron bodies to govern our schools.  However, it is one that has gone from strength to strength since the first school - the Dalkey School Project - was established in Dalkey in the late 1970s.  There have been 65 schools brought into operation across the country under the ethos of Educate Together and I understand more primary schools are to open this year and next year.  Five of these schools are within the north Wicklow and DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  They include schools in Wicklow town, Greystones, Dalkey, Monkstown and in my home town of Bray.  However, there is a problem as these students cannot progress to a nearby Educate Together secondary school as there is none in existence.  </p><p>  At the beginning of his term as Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn took the important step of recognising Educate Together as a patron body for second-level schools.  This commitment is welcome and I do not underestimate the significance of this recognition, given that a new second-level patronage body has not been recognised by the State since the 1930s.  When the Minister announced the new school builds to meet our growing population I was hopeful that the school at the Blacklion site in Greystones would be among the first second-level schools to attain Educate Together recognition.  This was not to be, however, although I know that sites in Drogheda, Blanchardstown and Lucan did attain this patronage.  I know that good campaigns by parents were run on behalf of the interested patron bodies for the Greystones site, but ultimately the Church of Ireland was selected as patron.  While I wish the school all the very best and I congratulate the parents and staff who are to embark on setting up this exciting project, a problem remains.  The five Educate Together primary schools to which I referred earlier, still have no secondary school nearby to which parents can send their children.  It is clear that this facility should be made available.</p><p>  Research undertaken by Trinity College Dublin, demonstrated that over 90% of parents whose children attend Educate Together primary schools would send them to an Educate Together second-level school if such were available.  This research is clearly reflected in the number of parents who wish to gain patronage at the Blacklion site in Greystones, with a total of 1,440 expressions of interest for such patronage.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that the VEC school in Kilcoole is over-subscribed from its own catchment area and that there is no viable multidenominational option for students in the Bray-Greystones area.</p><p>  Concerns have also been expressed to me that multidenominational admission policy does not adequately address the requirement for full equality and parity of esteem for students of all beliefs.  Therefore, the question arises as to what provision will be made by the Department to meet the needs of parents and families looking for a nearby second-level Educate Together school in the Wicklow-south Dublin area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#BB01300"><p>I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn, the Minister for Education and Skills.  As Deputy Ferris will be aware, the Minister announced in June of last year that up to the year 2016 a total of 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools are to be established across a number of locations, to cater for our increased pupil numbers.  Included in that announcement is a new post-primary school planned for Greystones in County Wicklow and which is scheduled to commence in September 2014.  The Minister also announced new criteria and arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and second-level schools.  The new arrangements published by my Department include the establishment of a new schools establishment group, an independent advisory group to advise him on the patronage of the new schools following its consideration of a report prepared by departmental officials.</p><p>These new arrangements provide a balanced approach in allowing applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools.  The criteria to be applied in respect of patronage decisions place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.  In accordance with the application and patron selection process put in place by the Department, an invitation for applications for patronage of the new post-primary schools issued in July 2011.  The closing date for receipt of applications from prospective patrons, having been extended to accommodate the possible submission of joint patronage applications, was 13 January 2012.</p><p> Applications for patronage of the new post-primary school in Greystones were received from Church of Ireland, Educate Together and County Wicklow VEC.  All the applicant patron bodies proposed to establish multidenominational schools in response to parental wishes.  There is only one post-primary school in the Greystones feeder area, namely, St. David's Holy Faith school, an English-medium Catholic school under the patronage of the Holy Faith Sisters.  The provision of a multidenominational school would serve to increase the diversity of school provision and broaden parental choice in the area.  All applicants agreed to comply with the relevant requirements set out by the Department and submitted very comprehensive applications.  All were assessed in line with the published criteria which clearly state patron bodies proposing schools will be asked to provide evidence of parental demand.  There was a considerable difference in expressed demand as between the different applications.   All other matters being equal, on the basis of parental demand, the recommendation was that patronage of the new school in Greystones be awarded to the Church of Ireland.</p><p> Departmental officials submitted a report to the new schools advisory committee in June 2012 for its consideration and a further submission to the Minister for consideration and final decision.  On 25 July the Minister announced his decisions on the patronage of 14 new post-primary schools to be established in 2013 and 2014.  The combination of the existing provision and the establishment of a new multidenominational post-primary school in the Greystones area will cater for the needs of all pupils in the area.  My Department will continue to monitor enrolments in the area to ensure there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected future demands.  Such is the scale of the projected growth in our post-primary pupil population that the Minister expects there will be a need to establish more new schools to meet the future demand for additional pupil places post-2016.  The area referred to by the Deputy is one of several areas of population growth under consideration in this context.  When the locations where further new schools will be provided are finalised and announced during 2013, it will be open to patron bodies, including Educate Together, to make an application for patronage in respect of any of them.</p></speech>

Educate Together will continue its campaign for a new secondary school to service the larger area to which I referred.  As I said, there are five primary schools under the patronage of that body in the Wicklow-DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  In most cases, the parents of the children attending these schools would like them to be able to avail of an Educate Together secondary education, either in County Wicklow or south Dublin.  The demand for Educate Together schools at both primary and secondary level continues to grow.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn's engagement on the issue of school patronage and the decision to nominate Educate Together as a patron for secondary schools.  However, there are many parents in County Wicklow who are very disappointed that their children cannot progress to a secondary school of the same ethos within their area.  There is a significant urgency to this issue as the children currently in Educate Together primary schools progress through the system.  I will convey the Minister of State's response to the parents concerned and advise them to contact the Department when the new round of schools is announced.</p></speech>

As in County Wicklow, there is a significant number of Educate Together primary schools in County Galway.  As those children move through the primary school system, I fully expect parental demand for a post-primary option to increase.  As I said, another round of new school announcements is expected in response to the very serious democratic challenges arising in the school system.  I have every confidence that Educate Together will feature in these announcements, if parental demand is sufficient.  The statistics certainly suggest we can expect to see a significant number of secondary schools opening throughout the country under the patronage of Educate Together.</p></speech>

The statement last night by the Finance Ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland can only be seen as a major setback to the efforts to secure an overall deal on this country's bank debt.   It is all very fine for the Taoiseach to insist that the summit statement from last June still stands, but that is no good to Ireland unless it is implemented.  The bottom line is that the June summit agreement will not be implemented without the support of the Germans, Dutch and Finns.  That is why we must treat last night's statement with extreme seriousness.</p><p>  The noises coming from Berlin, in particular, have not been favourable for some time.  Last month the German Finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, indicated that Germany would oppose any Irish debt-relief proposal which would, in its view, send a negative signal to financial markets.  Earlier this month the Chancellor, Mrs. Angela Merkel, expressed the view that Ireland was on a good path to recovery and she saw no need for changes to the bailout programme.  If the statement issued by the three Finance Ministers last night accurately reflects the current views of the German, Dutch and Finnish Governments, it is devastating news for Ireland.  A failure to do a deal on bank debt changes everything.  Such a failure jeopardises our ability to exit the bailout and return to the markets.  It means tougher budgets in the years ahead.  Above all, it means that Ireland's debt position will become unsustainable in the absence of economic growth.</p><p>  The statement sets out the position that direct European Stability Mechanism, ESM, recapitalisation can only take place once the &quot;single supervisory mechanism is established and its effectiveness has been determined&quot;.  Although we more or less knew this to be the case, it underlines the fact that a timely deal is unlikely.  The statement indicates that while the ESM may take direct responsibility for problems that occur under the new supervision regime, legacy assets should remain the responsibility of national authorities.  That is the key issue, as well as the stipulation that recapitalisation should occur using estimated real economic values.  In other words, there will be no free lunch from the ESM.</p><p>  What most concerns me is the impression among our European colleagues that everything is fine in this country, that we are back in the markets, meeting all the requirements under the bailout programme and ticking all the boxes.  We must offer our colleagues a more honest assessment of where we are at.  Such an assessment would acknowledge that day-to-day life for many Irish people is miserable because of the prevailing economic conditions.  Without a deal on bank debt, the prospects for recovery will be nowhere near as favourable as they could be.  That is the bottom line.</p><p>  Last March the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, while on a visit to the United States, said that if the world economy were to pick up, the Irish economy would take off like a rocket.  Unfortunately, the world economy has not revived and the Irish economy has not taken off like a rocket.  In fact, the domestic economy continues to shrink.  I am all for speaking positively about the economy, but all such talk must be grounded in reality.  In May the Minister told a Bloomberg economic summit that the economy was in a much better position now than it was last year.  That is not borne out by the statistics for unemployment, emigration, projected economic growth and tax receipts.  In recent months, for example, tax receipts have been  below what they were in the same period last year.</p><p>  Will the Minister give his honest response to what was said last night?  Is he disappointed by it?  Where does it leave us in terms of negotiating and securing an overall deal on bank debt?  I accept that he is genuinely seeking to secure such a deal, as evidenced by his travels to the various European capitals to meet his ministerial counterparts.  However, we must call a spade a spade and acknowledge that last night's statement is a major setback.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's honest assessment of the situation.</p></speech>

The Deputy should speak with a certain amount of modesty because all of the renegotiation being conducted by the Government on the bailout programme amounts to a series of attempts to unwind the deal made by the Fianna FÃ¡il-led Government which got us into difficulty in the first instance.  It made all the arrangements for the bailout and recapitalisation of the banks which we are now trying to unwind.  There is also a danger that the Deputy will fall into the Sinn FÃ©in trap-----</p></speech>

The statement addresses issues already decided upon by eurozone leaders when they met in Brussels on 29 June.  As the Taoiseach set out this morning, the Heads of State and Government made two important decisions on 29 June, the first of which was to &quot;affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.&quot;  The second, which related specifically to Ireland, was the following: <blockquote>The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  Similar cases will be treated equally.</blockquote>I emphasise the reference to equal treatment.</p><p><br />  Since that date, work has been proceeding on both of these elements.  Officials from my Department have travelled to several capitals.  I travelled to Paris, Berlin, Rome and on to the informal ECOFIN meeting in Cyprus two weeks ago, during which I had constructive talks with my colleagues.  The Taoiseach met with several colleagues last week in Rome and all agreed that the imperative is to move ahead urgently to implement all of the important decisions taken on 29 June.  I also draw the attention of the House to comments from the European Commission this morning, which set out that the agreement of 29 June was clear regarding the European Stability Mechanism and breaking the &quot;vicious cycle&quot; between sovereign and banking debt.</p><p><br />  We are engaged in a diplomatic offensive to implement the decision of 29<sup></sup>June to break the link between banks and the sovereign and enhance the sustainability of our debt.  I acknowledge that the three Ministers and their officials whom I met in their capitals, as well as other EU finance Ministers, have been helpful in moving forward the technical discussions with the troika, namely, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, on the banking debt issue in respect of Irish needs.</p><p><br />  It is in the nature of EU business that differences of interpretation may arise.  However, one thing is clear - the principle of breaking the link between sovereigns and banks has been agreed by the Heads of State and Government.  No one has questioned this.  That being so, our ambassadors in the relevant capitals and senior officials in Dublin are today urgently making contact to follow up on developments.</p><p><br />  This morning, a number of Deputies were disingenuous in attributing statements to my Department.  As those who read the statement from the three finance Ministers will have seen, they made reference to the recent positive reviews of the Irish and Portuguese EU-IMF programmes, which is welcome.  The strong implementation of reforms is one of the reasons Ireland's global reputation has improved so significantly and has led to record levels of foreign investment in the State.  The Government is committed to restoring confidence at home and internationally and the recognition by the three Ministers of the sacrifices that the Irish people have made should be welcomed.</p><p><br />  Ireland will be fully engaged in the process by the euro group and Heads of State and Government on how this will happen.  In putting forward our ideas, we must be conscious that other member states will also put forward their proposals.  However, as was pointed out by the Taoiseach this morning and my Department yesterday afternoon, Ireland's position is clear in this regard.  Work is continuing in line with the summit agreement of 29 June to break the link between banks and sovereigns and on the principle that similar cases will be treated equally.  As I stated, the European Commission reinforced this point this morning.</p><p><br />  It is worth pointing out that the Taoiseach, the TÃ¡naiste and I, along with ambassadors and senior officials, have been vocal in our view that the vicious cycle between banking and sovereign debt should be broken.  I remind the Deputy of the letter the Taoiseach sent to his fellow leaders earlier this year setting out the Government's position.  We want to continue to work in a constructive spirit to enhance the sustainability of our debt.  We have made strong, solid progress in implementing the terms of our EU-IMF programme and have lived up to all of our commitments.  The financial markets have recognised this, as reflected in the reduction of our bond spreads in recent months.  To be clear, Heads of State and Government made a decision on these issues and we continue to work within that framework to deliver the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#DD00600"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I will ignore the political swipe he made, which sounds rather tired at this stage, and focus instead on the substance of the issue.  He referred to differences of interpretation.  What we read last night from the finance Ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland was not a new interpretation of the summit statement from the end of June.  The three Ministers rewrote the statement and made fundamental changes which are, without question, to Ireland's disadvantage.  That is the nub of the issue, but the Minister appears to be in denial and gives the impression that last night's statement was not significant.  In fact, it marked a shift in position.  If the statement of the three finance Ministers reflects the views of their respective Governments, it is an extremely serious matter.  Either the Minister does not recognise that or he does not wish to admit it.  I want to have an open and honest debate on the issue.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the reduction in bond spreads in recent months.  This is a positive development and the National Treasury Management Agency has made good progress in this regard.  However, the reduction has been connected in no small part to the summit statement issued at the end of June.  The markets have priced in that Ireland will secure a deal on its banking debt.  This progress will be reversed, as we saw today, if it appears the deal struck at the summit will not be implemented.  The fundamental issue is whether countries will be treated equally.  According to the statement issued last night, countries would not be treated equally for reasons of timing because Ireland has recapitalised its banks whereas countries such as Spain have not yet done so.  We need to address that issue. </p><p>  I ask the Minister to set out what milestones lie ahead.  Where is all of this going?  We know it will take some time to establish the new European banking supervisory body.  What level of engagement is taking place between the Minister and his officials and our European colleagues?  Will he raise the issues referred to in last night's statement directly with his colleagues in the euro group?  Will they be raised at Heads of State and Government level?  Will clarification be provided on whether all Governments remain resolutely committed to the principles enshrined in the statement issued following the June summit?  What action will the Government take in response to last night's statement?</p></speech>

I presume the Deputy saw the statement issued by the European Commission this morning.  I will quote Mr. Olivier Bailly, a Commission spokesman, who stated at a media briefing that eurozone Governments should move "quickly" to break the link between bank troubles and sovereign debt.  The agreement reached in June by eurozone governments was, Mr. Bailly said, "extremely clear" in expressing a determination to sever this tie.  "Our position regarding breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign is very clear," he said. "We already showed our determination that for us, this should be done quickly."  The Commission, speaking for the whole Community rather than three Governments, is setting out the position, which is the position that was in the communiquÃ© issued at the Heads of State and Government meeting on 29 June.</p></speech>

However, there are 27 countries in the European Community and a spokesman for the Commission, which speaks for the Community, stated this morning that the policy remains the same as that outlined at the Heads of State and Government meeting of 29 June.  He also noted that member states should move quickly to implement this policy.  That is the position.</p><p><br />  On the general effect, the Deputy used words to the effect that last night's statement represented a major <i>dÃ©marche </i>by the three countries in question.  The markets are not taking it that way.  Irish bond spreads went out by 20 basis points today.  Given that they can rise by ten or 15 points in a normal day, 20 basis points is not an extreme reaction by the markets.  Spanish bond prices went out by 40 basis points, which is not dramatic for Spain because there is movement every day.  It is not that what was said was irrelevant - it is significant and everything must be taken into account - but in the broader scheme of things, it was a statement issued following a meeting in Helsinki attended by three Finance Ministers.</p><p>Obviously we take note of it and it goes into the mix of negotiation.  However, there are other views.  The view outlined by the Commission is the view expressed by the Taoiseach here this morning.  That is the official position of the Community.  We will see how these matters work out as the weeks go by.  The European decision-making process is always a bit untidy.  Anytime one has to get 27 governments to agree, it never runs in straight lines.  We must take the statement for what it is.  It was made, we know what it contains and one can measure its effect as the days go by.  So far today, it has not dislodged the Commission from restating the position as stated by the European Council on 29 June and the markets have more or less taken it in their stride.  The markets move every day but the movement today was relatively small.</p></speech>

Included is a petition of 25 names representing Meenavanaghan, Cross, The Cloghan and Lemacrossan in an area of east Inishowen besides Quigley's Point.  The demographics of the area show 75% of the community is elderly.  The advice from SAORVIEW is that once the switchover happens on 24 October, these communities will not be capable of receiving television coverage through SAORVIEW.  They have been advised to apply through Saorsat which will take upwards of 12 months to get, as well as an additional â¬170.  I do not believe that is a fair option or solution for the people living in these communities.</p><p>  The local television experts have done their research into the availability of television coverage in these geographical pockets.  The existing mast in the area is not part of the SAORVIEW upgrade.  Even the largest television mast in Buncrana will be no good as an option.  RTE will recommission some of the masts in Glenties and Clonmany, to ensure coverage in these areas.  SAORVIEW is of the opinion that channel 45 from Moville will suffice but I do not believe that will be a feasible option.</p><p>  I do not know what research the Minister's officials have done into this matter at this early stage.  The information the Minister will make available this afternoon may not reassure the communities in question.  Accordingly, will his officials investigate this particular issue in depth?  It may be a micro-issue and could be repeated in other parts.</p><p>  My colleague, Councillor Doherty, believes this is an issue of great concern to the communities in question.  Up to 75% of the population in them are elderly.  From a fairness and community point of view, as well as preventing rural isolation, television is a necessary communication mechanism.  If the Minister does not have an update on the matter today, will he use his offices to research this issue because it concerns a great number of people in east Inishowen?</p></speech>

RTE has built, owns and controls the SAORVIEW TV network and is responsible for its roll-out, coverage and operation.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 which provides that the development of the RTE network is an operational matter for RTE and, therefore, not one in which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a function.</p><p><br />  I have, however, had inquiries made about the coverage in Donegal as raised by Deputy McHugh.  Section 130 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 Act provides that RTE must roll out a national digital TV network to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, the analogue network covers 98% of the population and the SAORVIEW network will also provide 98% population coverage.</p><p><br />  Work has been ongoing right across the country to prepare the transmission sites for the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television.  However, it is impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.  Reasons for this include local topography, for example.  Regarding Donegal, I have been informed by RTE Networks Limited, RTENL, that as well as having ten of the 55 SAORVIEW transmission sites located in county Donegal - Glencolumkill, Aranmore, Glenties, Magheroarty, Fanad, Malin, Moville, Holywell Hill, Letterkenny and Ballybofey - a large part of south County Donegal is covered by the large Truskmore transmission sites on the Sligo-Leitrim border.  As the Deputy correctly stated, the existing mast in the area referred to is not part of the SAORVIEW upgrade.</p><p><br />  Notwithstanding this, SAORVIEW, over the old analogue network coverage in Donegal, will give an improvement in terrestrial availability of 6% for RTE One and RTE Two; an improvement in terrestrial availability of 11% for TG4; and, an improvement in terrestrial availability of 51 % for TV3.  I have also contacted RTENL on the townlands around Quigley's Point.  I have been informed that Quigley's Point and its environs are covered by SAORVIEW from a transmission site located near Ballymacarthur, to the north of Moville.  Further information on coverage is available on the SAORVIEW coverage checker on .</p><p><br />  Furthermore, according to RTENL, the majority of homes in the areas of Meenavanaghan, Cross, The Cloghan and Lemacrossan can avail of SAORVIEW or Saorsat.  The latter is, of course, RTE's free-to-air satellite service which was officially launched earlier this year and is, therefore, already available to homes in the area.  RTE is not obliged to provide this satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  With this satellite service, Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.  Currently, Saorsat provides access to RTE 1, RTE Two, RTE NewsNow, RTE +1, TG4, RTE's Digital Teletext service and a number of digital radio channels.  TV3 has not yet made a decision as to their carriage on the service.</p><p><br />  According to RTENL, the cost differential between a SAORVIEW and Saorsat, including full installation, is in the order of &#8364;100.  Should a home wish to pick up the UK free-to-air, FTA, satellite services, as well as the Irish services, households can opt for a satellite installation that provides access to both.  This option is about &#8364;50 cheaper than a full installation that provides for a combination of SAORVIEW and the UK FTA satellite services.  RTENL has developed an information booklet on Saorsat which is available on <i>www.rtenl.ie</i> .</p><p><br />  Should the Deputy have further questions, I will be happy to pass them to RTENL on his behalf for direct reply.</p></speech>

He has provided options.  Locally, there are concerns and what we are trying to do here is reassure people.  There seem to be options albeit more expensive ones which comes back to the fairness issue.  If this continues to be an issue, I acknowledge there is an option for the Minister to pass it on to RTENL.</p><p>  Sometimes we take for granted certain services.  There is a concern that if Saorsat is not in an area, it could take 12 months to commission.  I welcome the fact the Minister is keeping an open line.  I accept he does not have a direct influence with RTE but at the same time, people do bump into each other and they could highlight an issue.</p><p>  Those from Meenavanaghan, Cross and Lemacrossan who did not get tickets for last Sunday's All-Ireland football final watched it on their old television sets with excellent coverage.</p><p>Like the good people of Kerry, once one all-Ireland final is over, we start thinking about the next one.  I hope they will be in a position to avail of coverage of the all-Ireland final in 12 months time.  I am not predicting who will be in it, but it is important that they have coverage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#FF00600"><p>I wish we could say the same for the people of County Louth, but they have their own bone to pick with the Meath team.</p><p><br />  Earlier this year there was a tragic event off Glandore when five fishermen lost their lives.  Michael Hayes was the skipper of the boat involved.  The bodies of all five fishermen were found, which was a tremendous comfort to their families because at least their lost loved ones had a grave to go to.  That was a major help in the healing process.  In 2006 the <i>Maggie B</i> was lost.  On 10 January 2007 the <i>Pere Charles</i> was lost outside Dunmore East.  The following night the <i>Honeydew II</i> was lost west of Helvick Head.  Nine people in total were lost on these three fishing vessels and no body has ever been recovered.  Like anyone who has lost loved ones, the families live in hope that at some stage the remains will be found and that they will have a grave to which to take their loved ones.</p><p><br />  I understand that more than two years ago some remains, including a skull, were discovered off Helvick Head and that two femur bones were discovered off Hook Head.  They are believed to be the bones of a male between 25 and 30 years old.  Two years ago the Garda chief superintendent in charge in Wexford, John Roche, applied for special funding to carry out a special DNA test on the bones to discover whose they were since the initials test proved inconclusive.  Consideration is now being afforded by the Garda authorities to having a nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted on the remains.  My understanding is that the chief superintendent in Wexford at the time applied for funding to carry out these special tests which it was estimated would cost between &#8364;9,000 and &#8364;12,000 and were to be carried out in Wales.  Regrettably, the Department of Justice and Equality did not make the money available.  All of this was kept under the radar and no one knew anything about it until such time as a detective sergeant retired recently.  There was a report on 3 September on &quot;Six-one news&quot; on the discovery of these bones off Helvick Head and Hook Head and the story became public.  As a result, the families of those whose remains are lost continue to hope some of these remains might be those of one of their loved ones.  Two of the people lost on the <i>Pere Charles</i> outside Dunmore East were members of the Hennessy family.  I know the family well.  There is considerable hope that they will be able to discover some part of the remains of their loved ones.</p><p><br />  I seek an assurance from the Minister of State and the Government that, for the sake of &#8364;9,000 or &#8364;12,000 or whatever it would cost, the State will carry out these tests and that the Department will make the money available in order that we can ascertain whether the parts of a skull and the femur bones discovered have any connection with the people lost on any of the vessels mentioned.  There is dreadful anxiety for loved ones when they know that remains have been found but they do not know whether they are those of their loved ones.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything in his power to try to ensure that at least the families know whether these discoveries have anything to do with their loved ones.</p></speech>

He is aware of the concerns expressed by the Deputy relating to the finding of human remains off the coast of counties Wexford and Waterford.  It is natural that these developments cause renewed sadness and heightened expectations for the families of those who were lost in the sinking of the boats referred to by the Deputy, including the <i>Maggie B</i> in 2006 and the <i>Pere Charles</i> and the <i>Honeydew II</i> in 2007.  We all sympathise with the desire to have some closure and resolution for those who have been sadly bereaved through the loss of loved ones at sea.</p><p><br />  In cases of missing persons, whether at sea or on land, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na do all in its power to assist families and friends of those who have been lost.  Where remains are recovered, either on land or at sea, the question arises of the feasibility of carrying out appropriate tests to help to determine if the remains can be identified.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that inquiries to establish the identity of the human remains found have not yielded positive results to date and consideration is now being afforded by the Garda authorities to having a nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted on the remains.</p><p><br />  The advances provided by DNA testing are of considerable value to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na not only in criminal investigations but also in the identification of missing persons.  Certain tests are carried out by the Forensic Science Laboratory in Ireland; other less frequently required specialised testing may be carried out abroad.  While the DNA testing available here and abroad is often very effective, the advice to the Minister is that it is not always technically viable.  The Garda authorities have advised the Minister that an expert assessment is being carried out of the merits of performing the tests mentioned by the Deputy.  This is not simply a budgetary matter as has been suggested.  The advice to the Minister is that further testing may not be successful since the extraction of DNA profiles from bones that have been in the water for a long period is rather difficult because the sea has been found to cause substantial degrading of DNA material.</p><p><br />  It is beyond the scope of the debate to make detailed scientific judgments.  Therefore, the Minister believes this assessment should be allowed to proceed and its outcome taken on board by the Garda.  He acknowledges the concerns of the Deputy and others to ensure all that can be reasonably done to help the families is actually done.  He shares that concern, but he is also mindful of the need not to do anything which might give rise to undue expectations about the possibilities that the available tests might provide.  Accordingly, he considers that the best course of action is to await the outcome of the assessment before making more conclusive comments on the matter.</p></speech>

It is necessary to do so.  There is a contradiction because the information I have is that the Garda chief superintendent in Wexford applied for funding to carry out testing and was not given funding.  The fact is that the funding has been applied for.  The Minister of State suggested that if the Garda looked for funding, it would be made available.  I hope this is a misunderstanding rather than anything else.  If funding could be found to ascertain whether the remains found can be linked with the people missing at sea, it would be appreciated.</p><p>I appreciate that the fact the remains have been at sea for a long time makes it more difficult to prove scientifically whether they belong to missing persons but the Department should at least try to see if they can be linked to those who have been lost at sea off the south, south-west and south-east coasts.</p></speech>

It is clear that all in this House share the general concern to support the families of those who, tragically, have been lost of sea and to help them pursue any reasonable avenue for the recovery and identification of the remains of their loved ones.</p><p>  The Minister will, of course, raise the points expressed by Deputy Ferris with the Garda authorities.  He is also confident that the gardaÃ­ are doing all that they reasonably can to assist the families concerned.  The Minister is hopeful that when the assessment, which is currently awaited by the Garda authorities, is finalised there will be more clarity on the possibilities of effective testing of the remains which have been found.  I will bring the views of Deputy Ferris directly to the Minister and the Department's attention.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in, was one of those who did tremendous work on the all-party committee on the proposed amendment and Deputy Adams is on record congratulating the Minister and everybody associated regarding the work that has been done on this proposed amendment.</p><p>  The fact that there is almost universal support for the proposed wording is a tribute to the committee and, indeed, as with some other rare reports and issues, is testament to what can be achieved when all parties co-operate on issues that are not, or at least should not be, party political in nature.  If there was ever an issue that is not party political in nature, it is the rights and entitlements of children, and fair play to everybody concerned.</p><p>  We have noted publicly that the proposed text is not exactly that agreed by the committee and as a matter of course consulted our own legal advisers in regard to minor amendments which we and others feel may be necessary in order to come closer to the spirit of what was agreed at the committee.  Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in has tabled a number of amendments in that spirit which will be debated here.  We are doing so in order to bring the wording closer to the wording favoured by the committee and to strengthen the protections that it is proposed to insert into the Constitution.</p><p>  The amendment after line four is to restore the recognition of the need for equality between all the children of the State as was recognised by the original wording proposed by the committee two years ago.  It also is in line with the republican ethos of equality for all citizens and the need to recognise children as full citizens, something which has not been the case over much of the history of the State.  Tonight we continue last night's debate on the Magdelene Laundries and what happened the children who were put into institutions.  They had no protection and no rights.  We are cleaning up the mess where previous Governments, the political establishment and the State failed children so terribly in the past.  That is what we are trying to do to ensure that there will be protection for children in the future.</p><p>  The amendment to Part 2, to substitute the phrase &quot;brought by the State&quot; with &quot;that the State is party to&quot;, is designed to tighten up the definition of cases involving children in which the State may be involved in any manner, and not just where the State might be the guardian where a child is in public care.  The key concern must be to ensure that the State is clearly defined as the ultimate guarantor of the constitutional rights of children.  That is essential to guard against any situation in which it might be argued in law that no one has any right to intervene where there is clear evidence of or a strong belief that children are being denied those rights.</p><p>  Later this evening we will be return to the debate on my party's Private Members' motion on the Magdalene Laundries and the horrors that led to underline the dangers of a situation in which citizens, many of them legally children, were denied basic human rights.  That is a legacy of a hopefully receding past, but one the consequences of which still need to be addressed in order to ensure justice for the survivors.</p><p>  Of course, it could also be argued that at the time of the Magdalene Laundries and the industrial schools the State had abdicated its responsibilities in that regard and, in effect, privatised what was regarded to be a solution to a supposed problem of girls and women who were perceived to have offended against supposed social norms of morality.  That underlines the importance of enshrining basic rights in the Constitution so that the protection of those rights are never subject to current prejudices or even political ideology, but are enshrined in law.  That, indeed, is the purpose of a Constitution and the ability to amend that Constitution, as is proposed here, ensures that it can be brought into line with changing circumstances.</p><p>  The ideological issue relates to the period in which Bunreacht na hÃireann was drafted.  It contains many positive aspects and in the context of the time was not the uniformly reactionary document which some now see it as.  There were genuine concerns about the role of the state in the 1930s when most of the peoples of Europe were under totalitarian rule of one form or another.  Other European democracies did not have a constitution and that was seen as making them vulnerable to the erosion of rights.</p><p>  Totalitarianism regards people not as free citizens of a state but as virtual state slaves, here only to do the bidding of the state. The concept of rights does not exist.  However, the other extreme of claiming that the state ought to have no business in legislating in areas such as children rights, is equally flawed.</p><p>  There are clearly circumstances where the rights of children need to be protected even against their own parents.  We have seen in many instances where that was required and, unfortunately, will in the future require direct public intervention and in some instances the removal of children from dangerous family situations.</p><p>  While most people appear on poll and other evidence to be satisfied with the proposed amendment to the Constitution, there are some dissenting voices.  They deserve to be allowed state their case and their arguments need to be taken on.</p><p>  One of the arguments in opposition is that the proposed amendment will give the State too much power and might even potentially lead to a situation in which the State would have tyrannical powers over parents and families.  Examples have been given by opponents of children potentially being taken from their parents because a teacher, nurse or other person in contact with a child formed an opinion that the child was in actual or potential danger.  There is a certain validity to that argument but it does not carry sufficient weight to counter the need for the provisions proposed.  Professionals in contact with children need to be properly trained in the area of dangers to children and there ought to be safeguards against arbitrary and mistaken interventions.  However, that is not a strong enough argument against what is proposed in this amendment.  My party's advice also is that there is no danger, as argued by some of the more extreme opponents of the amendment, that the State will, in effect, become the ultimate legal guardian of all children.</p><p>  Of course, we must also recognise that the State has a responsibility to improve its own dealings in the area of child protection.  There is the historical legacy of the industrial schools and the Magdalene laundries, but also more recent and current shortcomings.</p><p>  One of these is the situation of children in the care of the HSE.  A worryingly large number of those children attempt or are successful in leaving HSE accommodation.  At present, in the region of 200 children are officially under HSE care but are unaccounted for.  That is not an acceptable situation.  While there are clearly many factors involved, it is an area that needs to be further investigated to ensure that children are not disappearing into lives of great potential danger, including trafficking.</p><p> In conclusion, my party welcomes the decision to hold a referendum on children's right and sees it as a positive step for society.  We look forward to debating our proposed amendments and to studying the provisions in the current wording.  We are dealing with a terrible legacy and there are concerns regarding the State becoming the guardian of the child.  The State must be the guardian of the rights of the child, not the guardian of the child, just as it must be the guardian of the rights of every citizen.  If we as legislators can do anything towards improving the Constitution, what we do must concern protecting rights and ensuring the rights of children, senior citizens and everybody are protected.  I look forward to the debate, but overall it is a welcome development.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on doing so and on the publication of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2012, which facilitates the adoption of children born to a marital family but who are in long-term foster care, which I understand will be defined as being for a period of at least 36 months.  This referendum will have a particularly significant impact in ensuring there are no inequalities between children when it comes to adoption.  It is amazing the number of people I have met in the course of my professional life who were unable to recognise this distinction, but a number of articles that have appeared of late have been very useful in informing the public of this particular aspect of adoption.</p><p><br />  The Minister has outlined a number of key objectives in the proposed constitutional amendment, including the protection of children and a focus on the &quot;best interest&quot; principle.  The concept of &quot;best interest&quot; is already well known and illustrated in Irish law and was a core element of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Adoption Act 2010.  It is a well defined principle, but it is now being given the <i>imprimatur</i> of constitutional backing.  Other core objectives are supporting families, the removal of inequalities in the area of adoption and the recognition of children in their own right.  The voice of the child will now be heard, as circumscribed in the new Article 42A.4.2<sup>o</sup>.  This is important, notwithstanding the fact that in family law proceedings the voice of the child could be heard.  Now, however, this provision will part of the bedrock of the Constitution.</p><p><br />  Our Constitution is now 75 years in existence.  It is the origin of the fundamental or basic laws of the State and guarantees a wide range and spread of personal rights.  We must acknowledge that many rights have, through judicial interpretation, been expounded upon as a result of proceeding through the High and Supreme Courts and we must be grateful for the level of judicial activism that put flesh on many rights through the interpretation of constitutional law, our bedrock or fundamental source of law.</p><p><br />  Children have rights under the Constitution, under Articles 41, 42, 43 and 44, which are the same fundamental rights granted to all ordinary citizens of the State.  These rights are implicit.  However, the conundrum arises when we examine the express constitutional provisions for references to children.  It is only in Article 42.4, which concerns the provision of free primary school education, we find direct reference to children.  We will leave aside for now the notion of free primary school education, which has never been as expensive as it is now.  Those who say children are virtually invisible within the Constitution are broadly correct in their analysis.</p><p><br />  The primacy of the nuclear family is defined in the Constitution and the special protection afforded the family under Article 41 remains firmly preserved and is not impacted upon by the insertion of this new amendment.  This is as it should be.  As parents, we are acutely aware that the rights of parents and children are always inextricably linked.  This fact can be garnered from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, introduced in 1989 and adopted and ratified by us in 1992.  The family is recognised as the fundamental grouping in society and as the natural environment for the growth and well-being of children.  Parents have, therefore, primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of their child.</p><p><br />  Article 18 of the convention affirms that the family requires protection and assistance to fulfil its responsibilities and places a clear duty on the State to support parents in rearing their children.  Of course, children have a right to be cared for by their families and this duty places an onus on parents to which they have not always adhered.  As we have seen from recent HSE performance monitoring reports, there are 6,282 children in the care of the State and 5,724 of these are in foster care.</p><p><br />  A number of rights interpreted in the Constitution and originating in the umbrella Article 40.3.1<sup>o</sup> are termed unenumerated rights, because they are not found directly in the wording.  However, as stated previously, they have derived from judicial interpretation.  In the absence of judicial activism, such rights might not have been found, and even when found, they are not absolute and can be limited or circumscribed by subsequent judicial decisions or by Government inspired legislation to restrict their application.  I could mention 100 of these in the education area that I have come across in practice.  Therefore, if a right is not expressed, it may not be found and if it is found, it can be subsequently circumscribed or restricted.  That is the simple reason we need the amendment.  There is no big hullabaloo about anybody interfering with a family or trying to rush in and take children away from parents.</p><p><br />  We are all aware that children's rights are determined by the marital status of the child's parents.  Therefore, Article 42A focuses on the protection afforded to children under the Constitution, while respecting and preserving the rights of parents and the family.  This is now a kind of stand alone provision.  The new provision recognises explicitly that children have rights and that all children are equal.  This, thereby, permits the balancing of constitutional rights where necessary.  In other words, we are recalibrating the rights in a hierarchy.  The principle of the paramountcy of the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; to guide court decisions when resolving disputes involving adoption, guardianship, custody or access and the acceptance of the principle of &quot;hearing the voice of the child&quot; in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child will now have constitutional affirmation if this amendment is passed.</p><p><br />  We are all aware of the background to the reasons this amendment is required.  I will not recount these as they have been referred to by Deputies Ferris, Troy and the Minister.  We are acutely aware of the failure of the State in numerous cases to intervene in a timely way, especially in cases of abuse and neglect.  Therefore, it is vital it facilitates State intervention and thereby places an onus on the State to support families and adopt a proportionate State response to parental failure.  The State must step up to the mark.  We should acknowledge it has a chequered history with regard to where children are concerned.  We cannot now just put down a marker and say that is the end of the matter.</p><p><br />  The reformation of the adoption laws is an important step, with over 6,200 children in the care of the State and approximately one third of these children in long-term care for more than five years.  Some of these have had little or no contact with their birth parents.  The legislation that will be introduced once this amendment is passed will allow children in the care system who have been abandoned to be eligible for adoption if this is in the best interest of the child.  Likewise, it will allow that children can be voluntarily placed for adoption, but with due safeguards to ensure that such a decision is not made under any coercion.</p><p><br />  Recently, I read an excellent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i> by Dr. Aisling Parkes and Dr. Simone McCaughren, both lecturers and experts in their respective areas of law in UCC.  This article expanded in a lucid and comprehensive way on what this referendum will mean to those in long-term foster care.  It focused in particular on the fact that currently it is virtually impossible for children born to married parents who are placed in long-term foster care to be placed for adoption, despite obvious failures on the part of the parents in caring for the children.  It also pointed out that unlike other children, such as those who grow up in their birth families or who have been adopted, these foster children are only afforded partial inclusion in family life and remain in a state of limbo.</p><p><br />  Under the new adoption Bill, marital children will be eligible for adoption once they have been in foster care for a continuous period of 36 months preceding the date of application.  The Bill provides as a protection that there must be no reasonable prospects that the child's birth parents will be able to care for the child properly so as not to impact negatively his or her safety and welfare.  This provision will only apply in the exceptional circumstances outlined by the Minister.</p><p><br />  Where children are capable of forming or expressing their own views, their voices will be heard and given weight in adoption cases.</p><p>That will depend on the age and maturity of the child.  The evaluation will be predicated on what is in the child's best interests.  I can do no better than to repeat the conclusion delivered by Dr. Parkes and Dr. McCaughren in their excellent article:<blockquote>This referendum has the potential to change children's lives for the better by enshrining their rights in our Constitution.  A constitutional provision that promotes the legal, emotional and social needs of all children who remain vulnerable in Irish society should be embraced.</blockquote>All that remains for me to say is I hope the referendum will be passed and that the necessary resources will be provided to enable the Minister to achieve what is set out in the Bill and the constitutional provision it will introduce.</p></speech>

As she is sitting in front of me, I take the opportunity to compliment her on the work she has done to date.  This is the first truly all-party issue to have come before the House since I was elected, in the sense that we have put aside our political differences in the interests of children who unquestionably comprise our most important resource.  While politics is an adversarial business, it has to be acknowledged that everybody has come together in this instance.  The importance of the referendum cannot be understated in that context.</p><p>  In the light of the Government's commitment to hold a number of referendums, it has been suggested some sort of league table should be drawn up to categorise them in order of importance.  As someone who has three children, it should be beyond question that nothing is more important to Irish people than how our youngest and most vulnerable citizens are treated, protected and cared for.  Our history as a people is by no means perfect in this regard.  Much of what we have been reading in recent days should reinforce the ambition of the people to start the process of making a statement about ourselves and our intentions as a people, race and nation.  Perhaps the most positive aspect of the referendum is that it gives us an opportunity to begin to effect real change for everybody in the country.  I do not believe the referendum will affect the vast majority.  I hope and pray it will not.  It will serve to protect the important institution of the family.</p><p>  The State's child protection agencies were required in 30,000 cases last year, some 16,000 of which involved children and some 1,500 involved suspected child sexual abuse.  I remind the House that the Proclamation of the Republic states &quot;the Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally&quot;.  Many believe that quotation comes from Bunreacht na hÃireann, a copy of which I can see on the Minister's desk, but that is not the case.  In a newspaper article today an esteemed judge writes that he believes this reference should have been inserted in the Constitution when it was drawn up.  I suggest it is not too late to place it in the Constitution.</p><p>  It is important to remind the House that organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Barnardos have been supporting the calls for the referendum to be arranged.  In recent years many reports have called for this constitutional protection to be put in place.  It is incumbent on all of us to encourage strong and vibrant debate and explain the four key areas covered in this proposal - protecting children, supporting families, removing the inequalities in the current adoption regime and truly recognising children in their own right for the first time.  The last of these four areas is perhaps the most important because there is a need to take the constitutionally protected views of children into account.  It is of paramount importance that we provide for this in the Constitution.</p><p>  I again compliment the Minister.  I encourage those of us who can influence people on the ground to talk to them in order that it cannot be said on 10 November next that the public is uninformed.  It is part of our job as elected representatives to meet people and give them the information they want.  I will certainly be doing this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#JJ00300"><p>I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on introducing the proposed amendment to the Constitution which will protect children, support families and ensure all children are treated equally.  The amendment represents a large amount of work.  I know the Minister and her staff have worked extremely hard and consulted widely to produce a carefully worded change to the Constitution.  Their hard work has paid off, as there appears to be broad agreement for the proposed amendment.  Almost 20 years have passed since the retired Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness first called for constitutional change of this nature.  That request was made on foot of a case in which a father had persistently raped and abused his daughter over a 15-year period.  Successive Governments since have discussed the issue, made promises, examined options, established committees and prepared report after report on how best to protect the rights of children under the Constitution.  It finally took a Fine Gael Minister - a woman at that - to do something about the matter.</p><p>  From the outset, the Government has shown that it intends to be a Government of action with regard to children's rights.  For the first time, a full senior Ministry was established to take responsibility for children and youth affairs.  The Minister has worked tirelessly since she took office.  I commend her for taking responsibility and dealing with this issue.  The proposed change to the Constitution is just one part of a series of actions being taken to create a more child-friendly environment.  One of the inequalities involves the different treatment of children under adoption law, depending on whether their parents are married.  The referendum will address this matter in order that foster parents can adopt children who have been living with them for many years, in some cases.</p><p>  We were all shocked by the findings of the Ryan report, in the Roscommon case and the independent report on child deaths.  The circumstances and attitudes that allowed such abuses to continue have to be challenged and overcome.  We need the referendum to protect the rights of children under the Constitution.  It is important to point out that the amendment supports the family.  Article 41 of the Constitution will continue to protect it.  The referendum is about the safety and welfare of children; it is not about taking children from families.  The State will be able to intervene only in exceptional circumstances, where there is a failure of parental duty.  This is only right, as no child should be sacrificed to protect his or her parents or the institution of marriage.</p><p>  The amendment to the Constitution is the starting block as we strive to protect the children of Ireland.  It is critically important that the appropriate structures are in place to ensure children are protected.  Earlier this year the Minister published the report of the task force on the child and family support agency, which is an essential part of our efforts to respond to the needs of children.  The report is the foundation for a revolution in child protection and family services.  The new agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection and family support for the first time in the history of the State.  Its establishment will mean that when a child comes to the attention of a social worker, an educational welfare officer or a garda, he or she will be brought into a single system and a single continuum of services, all of which will be focused on his or her well-being.</p><p>  We are moving from a position where the provision of child and family welfare services was barely a priority to one where it will be the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a single dedicated Department.  At the heart of the new agency will be a new service delivery framework which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases in order that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by way of new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support services.</p><p>The reference in the proposed constitutional amendment to proportionate responses will further underpin the development of these services.  This is all about family support and early intervention.  Family resource centres will also play an increased and very important role.  I was delighted to hear the Minister state earlier that the legislation to set up the new agency will be introduced and enacted in the current DÃ¡il session.</p><p> The children's referendum is very welcome.  I believe it will mark a turning point in people's attitudes to the issue of children's rights.  As citizens of this country, we all have a collective responsibility and obligation to ensure our children are protected.  Horrific mistakes have been made in the past, there has been a lack of accountability and children have suffered as a result.  It is up to us now to learn from those mistakes as we look to the future.  After all, our children are our future.  When good men and women fail to act, evil prevails.</p></speech>

I welcome its presentation by the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in her new Department and congratulate and thank her for completing the work that had been ongoing and bringing it to fruition as a meaningful and positive contribution for all of Irish society.  For too long, children were to be seen and not heard, but now they will have a voice.</p><p><br />  I want to deal with a number of issues and I will deal first with the wording to be put into the Constitution.  I fully support the wording and I want to elaborate on a few areas in which some people may want to pick holes during the referendum campaign.  The first sub-article of the amendment states: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  People have already criticised the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot; but it is a fair and reasonable wording to include in the amendment because, if it were not there, there would be an absolute requirement on the State to provide a particular set of rights over and above everybody else's.  In an ideal world we would not need this but, unfortunately, we live in the real world and people can only do what they can do.  That is why I support the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.</p><p><br />  Sub-article 2.1Â° states: &quot;In exceptional cases, where the parents, regardless of their marital status ...&quot;  This is very important as people are afraid there may be cases in which children will be taken from married parents.  The word &quot;exceptional&quot; is proper.  The Supreme Court is normally quite a conservative body and it will interpret that in a correct manner.  People do not need to fear that anything negative will happen in this regard.</p><p><br />  The sub-article continues: &quot;the State ... shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents ...&quot;  I support the use of the phrase &quot;by proportionate means&quot;, which is important.  I believe that phrase entered the political lexicon recently in regard to judge's pay in that judges were afraid they would be picked out and that this would be disproportionate.  Using the word &quot;proportionate&quot; is correct because everything in society must be proportionate and this will ensure the State acts in a proportionate manner and does not go over the top or drag its feet.  The inclusion of &quot;proportionate&quot; is sensible and, at the risk of sounding clichÃ©d, it is a proportionate word to use in this circumstance.  Again, this sub-article stresses &quot;the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&quot;</p><p><br />  Under sub-article 2.2Â°, &quot;provision shall be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law ...&quot;  There is separate legislation in this regard, the general scheme of which has been published.  If the referendum is passed, which we all hope it will be by an overwhelming majority, that legislation will then be introduced.  It is important that people have sight of this legislation now in case they think there is something coming down the tracks that they do not know about.  During the course of the debate in the weeks before 10 November, people will be looking at this in a little more detail and it is important that they be fully briefed on the legislation.  Initially, we are talking about the referendum but the legislation that will flow from this - if it is passed, as we hope - is equally important in order to give effect to the good intentions we want to insert in the Constitution.</p><p><br />  Deputy Penrose stated that the phrase &quot;failed for such a period of time&quot; refers to a period of three years, which is reasonable.  Up to now, this could have been interpreted to suggest that while a person may have failed, it is not forever.  This would almost abandon the child because of the need to satisfy some judges that a parent had failed in his or her duty if there is even a prospect that he or she might have a Pauline conversion in ten years' time and be willing to look after the child despite not having done so previously.  That issue has now been dealt with.</p><p><br />  Voluntary placement in regard to adoption will also be dealt with in this legislation, which is very important, and sub-article 2.2Â° also refers to the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; being a paramount consideration.  The final provision, sub-article 4.2Â°, states: &quot;Provision shall be made in law for securing, as far as practicable, in all proceedings ... in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child ... shall be ascertained and given due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.&quot;  This is also important.  We all know the views of infants will not be fully informed but a 12 or 14 year old child may be capable and know what is going on.  When we talk about a child, I presume we are talking about minors up to 18 years of age.  Although this might be spelled out during the debate, we need clarity on this issue of obtaining the views of the child.</p><p><br />  I presume all of these cases will be held in the family law courts, as most such cases would have been up to now.  In that situation, they would be held <i>in camera</i>, which is fine, as it is important that the privacy, personal integrity and family details of the people involved are protected from people with a prurient interest in some of these matters.  However, given that we are now putting children's rights into the Constitution, and given that such cases have to be dealt with <i>in camera</i> - as it would be unfair to put children in open court in front of large numbers of people - it must be taken into account that while privacy must be respected and maintained at all stages of the proceedings, there must be some method of ensuring that the outcomes as decided by the various judges in particular family law courts are made available to ensure there is consistency.  If everything is done in private, one judge in one part of the country could be following a particular line for years while another judge in a different part of the country is following quite a different line in similar cases.  It is important that people should not be victims of geography or of the views of a particular judge.  This is why it is important there is some way of monitoring the outcome of these cases while, I stress, respecting the privacy of the people involved.</p><p><br />  Many questions could be asked about why we need the referendum, but that has been well established.  We want to give children a voice because their voices must be heard.  We also want to ensure they have a chance to be adopted and become part of a family, especially where they have been abandoned or are in long-term foster care, and to ensure the State will respond much more quickly than it perhaps has in the past in cases of abuse and neglect.  We also want to ensure that in judicial settings, as I have outlined in regard to the wording, the child is at the centre of the case and is given paramount consideration.  We want to ensure the abuse that happened in the past does not occur again in the future.</p><p><br />  While preparing my notes for the debate, I was reminded of a case referred to by many speakers, the Kilkenny incest investigation carried out by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, which was presented to the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 1993.  The Minister has been quite right in pointing to a period of several decades during which we were aware of issues and all parties in government, while they did something, could have done more.  To go back to 1993, the Minister, Deputy Howlin - who is now back in government - will, when he looks at that report, probably ask himself why it has taken so long to bring this to fruition.  However, it is good that it is now happening 20 years on.</p><p>That location is only a few short miles from where I was born and reared.  I remember when it came to light there was shock among the local community.  We were living in an era where issues that went on within families were swept under the carpet and kept behind closed doors.  Thankfully we have a much more open society now where those types of issues are not kept behind closed doors and people no longer believe that if it is a family matter, they should not butt in.  That is a legacy of former times.</p><p> If memory serves me correctly it was 1979 when I first voted and it was in a referendum on adoption.  On the same day there was a referendum about amalgamating the Seanad panels for the University of Ireland and Trinity College.  I do not know what happened to that second referendum.  It was passed by the people but someone must have made a drafting error and perhaps the wording did not stand up.  The adoption referendum was passed overwhelmingly, with almost 100% support.  In the referendum on whether Trinity College and the NUI should be amalgamated into one panel in the Seanad, around 6% or 7%, primarily made up of Trinity graduates, voted against.  It seems the wording was flawed in some way because it never came to pass, despite the people voting in favour of it.  I believe I am correct in saying that the purpose of the adoption referendum was to copperfasten the rights of adoptive families under the Constitution, which gave primacy to the natural family or marital family.  A concern was raised about adoptive families having constitutional protection.  I remember it well because it was the first time I voted and here we are again, in 2012, voting on a similar---</p></speech>

That referendum was also passed but for some reason it never came to pass.  There was some flaw found in the wording of that referendum.  I often ask what happened to that provision.</p><p>  Time is running short.  Some people might believe that to speak for 20 minutes on an issue like this would be difficult but I could speak for twice as long if the time was available.  While this is strictly a non-party-political issue, I wish to point out that previous Governments set up the Office of the Minister for Children and former Deputies Brian Lenihan, Mary Hanafin, Brendan Smith and Barry Andrews had special responsibility for children at various times.  Some were what we would now call &quot;super juniors&quot; and sat at the Cabinet table.  I welcome the decision to give full Cabinet rank and a full Ministry to Deputy Fitzgerald.  There has been a continual evolution in terms of the opening up of Irish society, which has crystallised in the Minister's appointment.</p><p>  I always felt that a Minister for Children was necessary.  Nothing convinced me more of that need than when, in 2010, the Fine Gael spokesman on justice, Deputy Alan Shatter, issued a report, without proper protocol, on two children who died in care.  On that particular day there was a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and I asked Professor Brendan Drumm how many children had died in the care of the HSE.  He had no idea, not an iota.  He had no clue.  Professor Brendan Drumm was an excellent chief executive of the HSE and did outstanding work from a medical point of view, but there is only so much one person can do.  The issue of child care did not rank up there with cancer treatment, orthopaedics, accident and emergency waiting times, waiting lists, discharge policies and so forth.  It became clear to me then that nobody in the HSE was giving priority to children.  I praised Deputy Shatter at the time, which was not a popular thing to do among my colleagues on the Government side because they felt he had broken the rules by publishing the report.  He did the State some service by doing that because ultimately it forced the HSE to act and under Cathal Magee, Professor Drumm's successor, a report on the 196 children who died in care was published.  That needed to be done because there was total neglect of this area.  The child care services in the HSE were the poor relation and might have continued to be were it not for the reports that came into the public arena.  Deputy Shatter has contributed to where we are today and while he may have broken some technical rules about issuing reports - some might even argue that legally he was wrong to do it - he was right in the general approach he took.  He forced the HSE to examine its files and find out how many children died while in care or shortly after leaving care and then issue a full report.</p><p>  It has already been said here that this referendum is not a panacea for problems related to children but is an important step.  When the Minister gets the weight of the public behind her on 10 November, with an overwhelming vote in favour of this referendum, I hope that will translate into good financial resources to make the wishes of the people of Ireland, as expressed through the ballot box, come true.  If the people go to the trouble to come out on a Saturday, taking time out of their family life, and vote overwhelmingly in favour but then find that budgets for children's services are cut, they will feel badly cheated.  Given that the Government has decided to hold this referendum, it must follow through with the financial resources to back it up afterwards.  We are seeing such cuts already.  The services provided by the respite care centre for children in Mountrath, County Laois, for example, have been scaled back remarkably.  That centre serves children with special needs, which would be in the Minister's own area, as well as Deputy Kathleen Lynch's at the Department of Health.  Everyone praised the Paralympians and people with special needs during the summer but once the event was over, people had seen the gold medals and the publicity died down, we were back to the harsh reality of limited resources for services.</p><p>  There are two issues that I ask the Minister to address during the course of this debate, which are not specifically related to the referendum, but are in the realm of unintended consequences, to use the Civil Service speak.  At the moment there are up to 6,000 children in care, the majority of whom are in foster care.  The foster parents who are standing in for the natural parents who are not in a position to care for their children are doing all of us in society, the children themselves, as well as the natural parents, an enormous service.  They are rightly being compensated for the cost involved in taking a child into their homes.  It is important that if such families want to move on and adopt the foster child they are caring for, they will not find themselves at a financial loss by choosing to adopt rather than continue to foster.  Some type of transition payment must be introduced to assist those people who have taken children in, with goodwill and a big heart.  They would not have fostered children in the first place unless they had the heart, interest and fondness for children but they should not be financially disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to take that issue into account.</p><p>  The second issue that I ask the Minister to address relates to the points raised by groups such as Fathers for Justice.  In many one-parent families, the mother is rearing the child and the father is not on the scene.  The mother may be living with somebody else and the father of the child is not welcome.  The majority of these cases do not go to court because the father does not have legal guardianship.  I am not sure if the Minister has considered this but let us take a situation where a parent who has a child is no longer capable of caring for him or her and the HSE takes the child into care.  In due course, the HSE might decide that the foster family caring for the child should be allowed to adopt.  What if the other parent who had not been given the opportunity to participate in the child's life then comes forward and wants to be part of the child's life?  That parent might argue that he or she was essentially locked out by social and family circumstances.  In most cases, the parent in question would be an unmarried father.  Such fathers want to be assured that their child could not be adopted against their wishes.  I understand there are issues in the proposed adoption legislation for non-voluntary adoption where the parent has failed in his or her duty.</p><p>Will the Minister clarify the position in a case where one parent has failed in his or her duty but the other parent is now willing to step into the breach?  The voluntary placement for adoption of a child of marital parents is also being dealt with in the Bill.</p></speech>

I accept there is legislation governing guardianship <i>ad litem</i> but I understand the relevant section of the legislation has never been formally commenced.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the matter last year.  I seek that the Minister&#8217;s officials would check out the matter.  I was asked about the issue by a father.  Courts were instructing fathers to contribute to the cost of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> report.  The parliamentary question I tabled in the past year related to when the section relating to guardianship <i>ad litem</i> was commenced but I was informed that it was not commenced.  I urge the Minister to check out the matter because it is possible that judges could be breaking the law on the Bench every day by referring to such matters if the relevant measures have not been commenced.  We support the referendum and the greater emphasis on children.  This step is part of a continuum as society grows up, moves on and becomes more open.  It is a reflection of where we are as a society.</p><p><br />  The big issue that will arise in the coming weeks is media coverage because the national broadcasters are required to provide a 50:50 balance.  I do not know how that will work.  Perhaps they will have to curtail their coverage and there will be a greater emphasis on us as political leaders and non-governmental organisations to campaign vigorously if the media is not in a position to do so.  We do not want the situation to arise where it is necessary to deliberately manufacture a row on &#8220;The Frontline&#8221; for example to ensure an equal balance in coverage, if a valid editorial decision is taken that it is not the correct thing to do.  In the event of media coverage being reduced then the rest of us must step into the breach and do as much as we can.  In the previous referendum the Government spent a lot of money before the Referendum Commission was formally established and legislation was passed to allow the Government to put its case.  It did not come into the reckoning under the terms of the McKenna judgment.  There might be an opportunity to spend money before the formal writ for the referendum date is moved.  Unfortunately, we might have to get around the strict ruling of the Supreme Court on the issue.  I suspect that if a referendum such as this were in question the Supreme Court might have come to a different conclusion.</p><p><br />  We look forward to a good turnout on Saturday, 10 November.  We want people to come out and vote &#8220;Yes&#8221; and give their support for the referendum.  We want that to be followed up by an announcement in the first week of December of a handsome increase in budget resources for children to back up the referendum result.</p></speech>

It is something on which others have toiled and striven over a considerable period.  At this stage it is approximately 30 years since the first efforts were made to bring about the introduction of a provision relating to childrenâs rights and their protection under the Constitution.  The Minister has managed to bring the provisions before us in rapid time -18 months - and a target date for the referendum to take place in the month of November.  That is exemplary.</p><p>  I also compliment the Minister on the good work she has done on adoption.  Last Monday she signed an agreement with Vietnam to reopen and restart adoptions between the two countries.  That is a tremendous achievement considering the amount of effort that was made in the past without any result being achieved.  I compliment the Minister strongly on the active role she has taken since becoming Minister in delivering the commitment in the programme for Government, which was often promised in the past but was not delivered.</p><p>  It is incredible that almost 100 years have elapsed since an emerging nation promised to &quot;cherish the children of the nation equally&quot;.  That is one of the most quoted parts of the 1916 Proclamation, yet only now are we giving recognition and protection to children in the Constitution.  In the intervening period, child abuse was widespread in society, as various reports reveal, together with the testimonies of more than 13,000 children, now adults, who came before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  They reveal accounts of abuse - physical, sexual, emotional and mental in the various institutions that were in the control of the State, and others that were not in the State's control but should have been.  That is one of the great failures of more than 90 years of Irish statehood and independence, which has totally undermined the commitment in the Proclamation.</p><p>  As far back as 1979, when I was chairman of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, an inquiry was established into the prison system chaired by Sean MacBride, SC, and Professor Louk Hulsman.  The current President, Michael D. Higgins, and the previous President, Mary McAleese, were both members of the organisation.  At the time we conducted a survey of 200 ex-prisoners living in Dublin for the public inquiry.  We discovered that more than 80% of the survey cohort had spent much of their childhood in reformatories or industrial schools.  The existing legislation often committed them to many years in industrial schools and they were often forgotten in those institutions.  The ex-prisoners were damaged by the system in which they had spent their youth and they were further damaged subsequently and their adult lives ruined.</p><p>  For the first time, the Bill and referendum give Irish children full rights as citizens in their own right in the Constitution.  That is crucially important, that they are getting those rights by virtue of their own right as citizens not by proxy through anyone else.  There is something incongruous, almost perverse, that in conducting a public debate over the next six weeks 50% of the time will be given to the small minority in the country who may argue against the proposed assertion of children's rights in the Constitution, as outlined in the referendum proposals.  The media, and in particular RTE, should explore every mechanism for a balanced and fair debate within the constraints of the Supreme Court judgment so as to avoid creating a false polarisation dictated by a crude allocation of time on the basis of virtual opposition.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the long-awaited children's referendum is finally to be put to the Irish people.  Too many years have passed since it was first suggested, and too often this issue has been put off for another day.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is to be congratulated on publishing the text of the proposed amendment to the Constitution and for ensuring that the proposed amendment has such broad support.  It is important that we include in the Constitution a stand-alone article dedicated to children and we acknowledge that children's rights are not subordinated to the rights of parents but are recognised as being fundamental in themselves.  The Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness noted almost 20 years ago that the Constitution may be &quot;interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents, than to the rights of children&quot;.  Since that time, successive Governments have examined the issue, but until now no action has been taken.  While these matters were being examined, for example in the Roscommon incest case, the State was prevented from acting to defend abused and neglected children.  The parents of those poor children brought a successful High Court challenge to prevent child protection services from acting, and the children continued to suffer.  An anomaly exists in terms of the current interpretation of the constitutional provisions.  That is something which must be eliminated.</p><p>For most children, the best place to be is with their families and the proposed amendment does not alter the assumption in law that this is the case.  However, for a small number of children it is not always the case.  The proposed amendment provides for when and how intervention by the State should occur.  It will ensure that in exceptional cases where, due to parental failure, the safety and welfare of any child is at risk, the focus will be on addressing the impact of that failure on the child.  For these children, this referendum will ensure that the State can provide early intervention and family support to protect them in their home, by providing constitutional recognition to the concept of "proportionate" responses to child protection concerns.  Where such efforts are not successful the State can ultimately go further in ensuring the child's protection and, if required, make alternative arrangements.</p><p> The proposed rights and protections incorporated in the amendment are for the benefit of all children, irrespective of the marital status of their parents.  The aim is that children of married and non-married parents will be treated equally when it comes to protecting their safety or welfare, their access to adoption and the consideration of their best interests and views in key proceedings.  All these factors will be taken into consideration.  In particular, the amendment provides for the making of legislation to allow for adoption where it is in the best interests of a child who is in foster care because of the serious and persistent failure of his or her parents, irrespective of the marital status of the parents.  It also facilitates the making of legislation to allow for the voluntary placement of a child for adoption.  The aim of these changes is to give children in foster care a better opportunity to experience the security of a loving, caring family.</p><p> I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has also published the draft Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2012 which the Government plans to bring before the Oireachtas on the passing of this referendum.  The proposed amendment also requires that the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration and that the voice of the child be given due weight in court proceedings taken by the State relating to child protection and in matters relating to adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  It should be the case wherever possible that the voice of the child should be heard.</p><p> By voting &quot;Yes&quot; on 10 November, the Irish people will remove inequalities in adoption and will help ensure that vulnerable children are not denied the help and support they may require.  This child-centred approach is present in both the legislation and the referendum proposals.  Last year, approximately 1,500 children were identified as having been abused, sexually, physically or emotionally, and 30,000 children were dealt with in terms of protection and welfare.  That is a very sizeable proportion of the children in the country.  It is very important that we get the basic framework document right, namely, the determining body of rights in the Constitution.  Up to the present we have denied the children of this country; on 10 November we propose to address this.  I wish to ensure this outcome comes about with the highest possible percentage of the people voting &quot;Yes&quot;.  The obligation is on Members to ensure that all sides of this House in favour of this legislation - as all are - get good campaigns going on the ground to ensure that is the case.</p></speech>

It is good that we are at this point and these measures should be supported.  I welcome that there is support on all sides of the House for this worthy amendment to the Constitution, one that is pertinent and necessary.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p>  The amendment will create the new stand-alone article, Article 42A, which will achieve a number of objectives.  First, it will establish the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and facilitate a situation whereby the State, by proportionate means, can endeavour to supply the place of the parents, always with due regard to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  The parallel legislation will provide for the adoption of children whose parents have failed them over a period of time, and as prescribed by law.  It will provide for the views of children to be taken into consideration, which is critically important.  It is worth mentioning at the outset these salient points of the new proposed article.  </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that the wording in no way threatens the position and primacy of the family, as outlined in the Constitution.  Rather it accepts that primacy and the special status of the family but, in parallel with that status, it equally gives imprescriptible, inalienable and unmovable rights to the child and puts them on a constitutional and statutory basis.  That is a critical point to make - there is no conflict with the rights of the family which remains centre-stage and a centrepiece of the Constitution.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the need for this referendum is underpinned by a number of reports and commissions down the years.  It was first called for by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness on foot of the Kilkenny incest case.  The need for a referendum is very obvious arising from the Ryan report, the Kelly Fitzgerald case and the Cloyne report and, very obviously, from the Roscommon case.  That case was very recent and was an appalling horror story.  In that case it was possible for the parents of those unfortunate children, thus described by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to go to court and prevent the removal of the children from the family home by invoking the special status of the family.  Although individual judges would look to individual rights and apply them to children, and there would be many cases of benign judgments by individual judges, and although the potential within the Constitution already exists for same, we must copperfasten the position of children to the extent there can be no case whereby, through human error or misinterpretation of the Constitution, the rights of children could be submerged, go into second place and have a secondary status.</p><p>  The very eminent judge, Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, made the argument in a recent newspaper article that in its present form the Constitution allows judges to make rulings that would support children.  Although that may be the case the possibility for alternative rulings, as demonstrated in the Roscommon case, is enough of a rationalisation, justification or reason for this constitutional amendment.  If averting the horror, cruelty, pain and suffering endured by a few children - there are many more than a few - were to be the only outcome of our making this amendment it would be justified.  That point merits making as does another interesting observation, namely, that this amendment will actually support the family to the extent that it will underpin family support services.  In other words, there will be a constitutional imperative for positive interventions in support of the welfare of children within families because of the standing of children within the Constitution, whether such interventions are financial or offering professional assistance, etc.</p><p> I had the privilege recently of visiting the Extern service in my home area of County Cavan.  It is a group under the auspices of the Health Service Executive which works with children from dysfunctional families who have particular social and emotional difficulties.  They are children at great risk but Extern works very effectively with those children.  There will now be a constitutional imperative on this Legislature to support people such as those in Extern, those in Youthreach and families in difficulty.  Rather than undermining the family and taking children from the family home, the onus will be to support the family and create the ideal conditions in families.  It is only when that effort breaks down and there is a clear threat to the well-being of the children that they would be removed.</p><p> It merits mentioning that this constitutional amendment will provide an opportunity for adoption of children from married couples.  That is an important dimension.  As the law stands, while there may be a theoretical possibility of adoption of children from married couples it would have to be established that the child is at risk until the age of 18 and that he or she would remain permanently at risk.  It is well nigh impossible to adopt the child of a traditional married couple, even though that child is in continuous foster care.  The legislation states that the children will have to be out of the home and in continuous care for a minimum of three years.  It states also that they would have to be 18 months with the family which proposes to adopt them.  All of those safeguards are built in but it will now allow children from marriages to be adopted.  Also, apart from State intervention a married couple can offer their child for adoption if they know that is in the best interests of the child and that is established by all the relevant authorities.  That is an important dimension of the amendment.</p><p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, stated, all of the parties have publicly supported this measure, and that is to be applauded, which will ensure that for once the voices of children will be heard officially and that will be reflected in the Constitution but it is imperative to back that up with an effective campaign in the coming weeks and that we bring this to the people.  It is significant legislation in the light of the many areas where we have failed children in the past.  We have an enormous amount in terms of children's issues but that is not what we are discussing today.  We have failed significantly also and in light of those failures it is incumbent on us to redress those failures with an effective campaign beginning this afternoon.</p></speech>

It is great progress.  I have read a good deal on this in the past week but regardless of what I read, I had a meeting this morning with representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance and having listened to their argument and the information I got from them, I have to say I will not be able to sum it up any better than them.  As they say, if you cannot beat it, why not repeat it?</p><p>  The Children's Rights Alliance gives five key reasons for supporting the children's referendum.  First, for the first time the Constitution will take a child-centred approach to the protection of all children and will allow for the State better to support families that are struggling rather than wait for a situation to reach crisis point.  No one can have a problem with that.  Obviously, that is a welcome development.  Second, it will allow up to 2,000 children currently in long-term State care the opportunity to be adopted and given a second chance to have a loving, stable and permanent family.  We have seen situations in the past where that was not possible and it created hell for some of those children.  That is very welcome.</p><p>  Third, it will base child care, adoption, guardianship, custody and access decisions on what is best for the interests of the child.  Yet again, no one can argue with that.  It is obvious.  Unfortunately, for years the State was more focused on preserving the family regardless of the hell the family brought on the child.  This is a welcome measure.</p><p>  Fourth, it will ensure the judges listen to the views of children when making decisions in child care, adoption, guardianship, custody and access cases.  I understand this is where the children are old enough or they have the mental capacity to do so.  That makes sense.  Obviously, we should listen to the child.  The child will be able to tell us what is happening and what is best for them.</p><p>  Fifth, it will set out how we as a country now view and value children and move beyond the damning history of child abuse in Ireland.  Again, one could not disagree with that.</p><p>  Obviously, this is good news but the cloud of resources hangs over everything.  Without resources, how can we successfully achieve what we are trying to achieve?  In recent days some organisations stated that we are facing a further six or eight tough budgets in a row, and that will affect resources.</p><p>  I have spoken to people who work in this area and while they are delighted that something is finally being done and well done on that, they are worried that when this happens, if it does happen, the resources will not be in place to deal with the consequences.  In some child care facilities children who have been sexually abused are housed with children who have sexually abused.  We have situations where children have got over the mental torture of what happened to them only for another child, in some cases with serious mental difficulties, to be brought in with them.  That is not on.  As some people who worked in the service would say, and they will remain confidential because they educated me on it, at the current level of resources the Health Service Executive and the State are not a safe family.  If we pass this measure we must make sure that the people we are trying to help are properly helped.</p><p>  I am also told by people who work in this area that there are not enough resources for psychological help, counselling and so on.  That must change.</p><p>  Ideally, no one would end up in these facilities, which will never be ideal because they will never replace the family.  To ensure that fewer people end up in this situation, we must provide support at a very young age.  I hope the Family Support Agency will sort that out.  In that way we will have more resources in the long term.  It is cheaper and less expensive to do that at an early age which means we will have more resources for the hard cases.</p><p>  I am aware from talking to many people who work in this area that it breaks their heart to have to say that they know that many of these children will end up in prison.  There is no shortage of resources at that stage, when it is too late.  The prison in my town spends over â¬100,000 a year trying to help people but if those people had been helped as a child it would have cost a fraction of that.  Resources will be a problem.  If we use resources well we might be able to hold our heads a little higher because at the moment, from what I know about what is going on, I am embarrassed to be a citizen of this country.</p></speech>

To some extent I regard it as a type of cleansing of a shameful record which this State has in the protection of its children.</p><p>We are very keen to blame the churches - rightly so - for the clerical abuse which occurred and also other institutions for what happened to children in our shameful past.  However, the State ignored what was happening, turned a blind eye to it or did not know - when the opposite should have been the case - what was being visited on the children of the nation.  The constitutional amendment is a way of cleansing the conscience of the nation and absolving ourselves for our record in this regard.  In that sense, it is not merely a case of taking an approach similar to that adopted by Pontius Pilate, it is also a way of remedying a situation which was unacceptable.  We should all be ashamed of the culture of turning a blind eye with regard to the abuse of children.  If the amendment has a tangible effect in resolving matters in this regard, then I welcome it.  The debate that will ensue in the forthcoming referendum will assist in cleansing the polluted atmosphere that has surrounded the fate of the children of the nation.</p><p> I was taken by what Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said about children.  We tend to be particularly patronising towards children and their inability to make up their minds and express their views.  The constitutional amendment will also help to remedy matters in this regard.  Children of a very young age can make intelligent decisions in their own interests.  In many instances, they know - far better than adults - what is good for them.  For example, children who are of an age where they can answer questions in an intelligent fashion and who go before the Adoption Board are regularly asked whether being adopted is their wish.  Their reply in this regard is material.  In that context, whether they say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; is absolutely vital.  If a child says he or she does not want to be adopted, his or her wish must be taken extraordinarily seriously and the matter must be investigated.  Let us not be overly patronising towards children; rather let us say they should be consulted in a sophisticated way because they often know - better than adults who are, or who are supposed to be, striving to protect them - what is good for them, what they want and what will fulfil their emotional needs.  The Bill makes a significant advance in that regard.</p><p> In view of State's record in this area, I am somewhat uneasy about it being allowed to intervene, in certain circumstances and as a last resort, where children are under pressure.  However, I do not see a solution to this problem.  I hope a very broad-based, caring and humane body will be put in place to intervene on behalf of children in cases where they are being threatened by those who are looking after them or who are supposed to be doing so or by their protectors or guardians in difficult or controversial circumstances.</p><p> It is welcome that the inequalities in the adoption process are being remedied.  I was unaware - I am sure this was the case with many other Members - that there were still such inequalities.  During the years I have seen a raft of legislation in which the treatment of children has been equalised, regardless of the marital status of their parents.  That is a matter which obviously should be remedied.  If what is before us is the final remedy in removing an existing anomaly, I welcome it.</p></speech>

I have always believed the absence of specific rights for children has weakened the law for far too long.  I applaud the proposed rebalancing of parental and children's rights in order to ensure the problems of children in seriously dysfunctional families can be addressed and that the marital status of parents cannot be an obstacle in this regard.  No child should be obliged to remain in a family which is dangerous, abusive and neglectful.  The State must be able to intervene to protect such children from harm.  However, I would prefer if the circumstances in which a child can be taken from his or her parents were more clearly defined.  From my reading of it, the constitutional amendment does not appear to outline the position adequately in this regard.  I am aware that a number of amendments on this matter have been tabled and perhaps the Government might give them consideration.</p><p><br />  No one needs to be reminded of the horrors inflicted on generations of vulnerable children.  I hope the legislation will do all that is necessary to prevent a recurrence of these horrors.  Overall, the proposed constitutional amendment will help to protect children, which is an important point.  I understand it will also enable the State to provide better support for vulnerable parents in circumstances where they are struggling to care for their children.  Hence, we will be able to provide services to ensure fewer families reach crisis points which place children at considerable risk of harm.  However, the proposed amendment is a half measure, particularly in view of the fact that the Government is continuing to cut supports for disadvantaged and vulnerable families and children.  I need not remind the Government that in 1992 Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and pledged to make children's rights a reality and ensure every child would have the right to experience a childhood free of poverty and deprivation.  There is nothing in the wording contained in the legislation which will hold the State to this promise.  In the absence of real and practical action, the forthcoming referendum will be nothing more than a symbolic gesture to the many thousands of children at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale.  Do the 10% of Irish children who live in consistent poverty not also deserve a modicum of justice?</p><p><br />  Last week cuts to counselling services in schools were highlighted in the wake of an attempted suicide by a student at a second level school in Wexford.  Teachers will affirm that children's lives are at stake as a result of the crisis affecting counselling services.  No constitutional amendment is going to ameliorate the position in this regard.  These are not good times for children who are reaching adult age.  The Bill will be meaningless for the 75% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years whose futures are uncertain as a result of the fact that they are out of work.</p><p><br />  It is highly commendable that the Government is to strive to refocus the child protection system and increase the obligation of the State to support families.  The State has always had a moral obligation to support families.  Any move to place this on a sound legal footing is to be applauded.  In the absence of adequate investment in child supports, however, this will prove to be just another exercise in bureaucracy.  I regularly come across child welfare cases in my constituency and have written to various Ministers about instances where there is no dedicated social worker available and a care plan is non-existent.  Despite promises to the effect that there would be a nationwide system, out-of-hours social work services are still provided on a very <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Aftercare services are, on the whole, inconsistent and erratic.  I have spoken to many social workers who have acknowledged this.  They may not comment publicly, but they will make their views known to politicians.</p><p><br />  The rights the constitutional amendment will afford to children such as the right to an education are all very well, but how will they impact on, for example, parents who are fighting their way through the system to obtain the services of an SNA for their autistic children?  The amendment has the potential to do a great deal of good and I will be supporting it for that reason.  However, the Government is presenting a very naive view if it attempts to suggest acceptance of the amendment will mean children will no longer be at risk or disadvantaged.  The only way to protect children is by investing money and resources in the relevant services.  To truly look after the welfare of children, we need to find the political will to put in place a multifaceted, joined-up approach.</p></speech>

What is being done is both positive and long overdue.  Observations or comments I may make should not be taken as criticisms of the Bill.</p><p>I want to highlight the need for joined up thinking across Departments if the theory is to be put into practice.  It is very good that the rights of children are being enshrined in the Constitution but it is also very important that the theory is matched with practice.</p><p><br /> I refer to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage:<blockquote>Constitutional change...gives us a rare opportunity to look at ourselves as a nation and ask if we are truly espousing the correct values.  It gives us an opportunity to assess what we stand for.  Ultimately, constitutional change allows us to consider future generations and ask what Ireland they should live in.</blockquote>Without being smart, I wish to point out that research has shown that the people who suffered most from the last budget were less well-off women and children.  I note the statistics that 90,000 children in Ireland live in consistent poverty and a further 200,000 are at risk of poverty. </p><p>The Central Statistics Office published a special report on homeless persons in Census 2011 on 6Â September 2012 in which it reported that one in eight homeless people is a child under 14 years of age.  The report recorded 457 children under 14 years out of a total of 3,800 people homeless on a single night in 2011. </p><p>The Minister in her contribution stated: &quot;We must hope that all children will have rights, will be protected and will be treated equally.&quot;  The Minister has aspirations for the future and that is good.  However, one important factor in determining how the future will be is the education system.  I note that the playing field is not level in the Irish education system and this has a significant impact on the end result for children.  In my view, people have every right to avail of private education for their children but the Government should make an effort to create a level playing field in so far as possible.  With that in mind I do not think we should be giving State help to schools that are not open to everybody.  This is an aspect of the education system that needs to be dealt with.  I commend the statement in the Minister's contribution: &quot;This is a referendum for all children but, in particular, for those children most vulnerable and most at risk.&quot; </p><p><br /> The inclusion of children of asylum-seekers is an important provision.  I refer to the recent report from the Irish Refugee Council which paints a grim picture of the State system for accommodating asylum-seekers, known as direct provision.  It documents frequent instances of malnutrition among children and expectant mothers as well as diet-related illnesses among babies and young children.  The study highlights cases of weight loss among children and regular complaints of hunger among adults as a result of strict family rationing.  There are more than 1,700 children in the asylum system and they seem to spend on average approximately four years waiting for the processing of their claims for asylum.  The report's author, Samantha Arnold, pointed out that the conditions in which the children live amounted to child abuse and neglect.  This is very upsetting.  She added that both Fine Gael and the Labour Party committed in July 2010 to a review of the system of direct provision but to date these commitments have not been met.</p><p><br /> I wish to raise a technical issue which is not intended as a criticism. I note an observation by Carol Coulter in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  She refers to Article 42A.4.1 which states:<blockquote>Provision shall be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings -Â <br /><br />(i) brought by the State, as guardian of the common good, for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, orÂ Â <br /><br />(ii) concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</blockquote>She questioned what would happen in cases taken against the State and whether the best interests of the child would be considered.  She stated that it might mean that the best interests of the child need not prevail in actions taken by Government Departments, for example, in the placing of an asylum-seeker's children in direct provision accommodation condemned as unsuitable by many NGOs or the widely criticised practice of placing children with mental health problems in adult psychiatric wards or the provision or lack of provision for the education of children with special needs.</p><p><br /> I am not making a criticism of the Bill but rather an observation.  I hope that the State puts the interest of children first in all aspects and that this will be taken into account in the next budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#QQ00300"><p>I wish to share my time with Deputies John O'Mahony and Peter Fitzpatrick.  The journalist Olivia O'Leary wrote a very moving column the other day describing how as a young reporter she had once written a series on adoption for <i>The Irish Times</i>.  She rang a nun, an admirable woman, who was in charge of an orphanage for girls in Dublin.  She told Ms O'Leary how sometimes in the middle of the night, a youngster would wake up and cry out for her mother.  Within minutes, she said, the whole dormitory would be awake, all crying out for their mothers, mothers they had never known and could have had no memory of.</p><p><br />  It is an image which Olivia O'Leary says has always haunted her, of children crying out in the night for their dream of a mother.  It is an image that haunts me too.  It was a mother they would never have - in some cases because they were at an age when adoption was now unlikely to happen, but in many cases because they were the children of legally married parents and could not be adopted.  I agree with Olivia O'Leary that it is extraordinary that we should have created a legal limbo in which children whose parents could not look after them because of drink or drugs or mental illness or other problems, should be forever denied the love of a mother and father and family.  It seems extraordinary to me that this limbo still exists.  The reason is that our Constitution protects the rights of legally married parents but makes no reference to the individual rights of a child.</p><p><br />  As an adopted person myself, I can identify strongly with those children crying out for their mothers.  I understand the longing that children feel to have a mother, a father, a family unit, whether by birth or by adoption.  As Minister for Social Protection, I have committed to introducing legal measures that give children their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which include the right to have information on their birth parents.  I am planning to legislate to allow for the inclusion of the name of the father on a child's birth certificate.  </p><p><br />  I propose to seek Government approval to publish the heads of a civil registration Bill soon.  This will provide further amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 relating to the registration of births and deaths; the validation of marriages at embassies and civil partnerships; to prevent marriages of convenience and to make a number of other amendments.  The Bill will implement recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on legal aspects of family relationships, in particular, that there should be compulsory registration of fathers of children in the case of non-marital births.  This obligation will be modified by the right of the mother not to register the father's particulars where she fears for her safety or that of her child; a proposal to allow a mother to effect registration on foot of a statutory declaration that her legal spouse is not the father of her child, thereby making it easier to rebut the legal presumption of paternity where a woman's husband, who is not the father of her child, is unco-operative or cannot be contacted.</p><p> I have heard various radio discussions where parents expressed the fear of the knock on the door from the social worker who would wish to take their child away from them.  That is emphatically not what the referendum is about.  It is, however, a fear that I understand, given this country's complex history of the wielding of institutional power since the Famine.  There is a collective long-term memory of the institutionalisation of children, and the fears arising out of that experience must be respected.  As a person who had the good fortune to be adopted into a very loving family, I would wish that option to be made available to children in care whose birth parents are unable to fulfil that role.   As I said, I understand the fears regarding social workers.  As a child, I was rather thin and weak looking.  My mother and her friends in the neighbourhood always had a fear that if I did not eat enough, I would be taken away.  Looking at me now, colleagues may find that interesting.  There was a genuine fear of the very powerful institutions and authority figures in Irish life, including the church, local people in authority, the "cruelty man", people from various charitable organisations and members of the judicial system who had the power to put children into institutions for long periods.  That folk memory remains.</p><p> It is important, therefore, to reiterate, as the Minister has set out very clearly, that the proposed amendment encompasses an appropriate proportionality in regard to the powers of the State to intervene in family life.  Everybody will agree that the best place for a child is with his or her parents.  Where that is not possible, however, this proposal seeks to give children in institutional care a second chance to have a loving family.  That is the issue on which we must focus.  We are all aware of situations where it would be most desirable for a long-term fostering arrangement to progress to an adoption relationship, where that is the wish of both foster parents and foster child.  Unfortunately, that is very difficult to achieve under the current legislative and constitutional position.  Even where a child is with his or her foster parents from babyhood or very shortly after, the consent of a social worker is still required in respect of a range of common activities which other parents take for granted, including quite straightforward matters such as trips abroad.  The constitutional amendment we are proposing has a very particular purpose in regard to the position of children in long-term foster care whose married parents are unavailable to care for them or who wish to allow them to go forward for adoption.</p><p> The referendum proposes a major and historic change to the Constitution which seeks to protect children, support families and ensure all children receive equal treatment.  It is nearly 20 years since Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who has since retired, called for constitutional change of this kind.  She made that call in the wake of a case where a father had persistently raped and abused his daughter over a 15-year period.  Since then, we have had a range of reports - 17 in total - detailing abuses of Irish children within the family setting, the environment in which a child should be safest.  In some cases, unfortunately, it was the place of greatest danger for the children concerned.  Now, after all of those horrific reports on a series of child protection failings in Ireland, this Government is taking action.</p><p> The proposal before us today seeks to benefit all children but particularly those who are most vulnerable and most at risk.  The vast majority of children live in loving, caring families and never require the assistance of the State's child protection and welfare services.  Unfortunately, however, that is not universally the case.  Some families require help and support in parenting their children.  In some cases, this might involve addiction and mental health support and family and individual counselling.  The provisions contained in the amendment will support that.  It also provides that in the most serious cases, children may be moved from the family and cared for by people other than their parents.  More than 85% of non-voluntary admissions of children to care in 2011 were due to abuse, neglect and serious family problems.  In the case of children, love is key and comes far above material considerations.  This constitutional amendment seeks to afford certain children a second chance to have that experience of love and cherishing.  As such, I commend it to the House and to the electorate.</p></speech>

It is a long awaited and much needed initiative and I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet on bringing it forward within 18 months of coming to office.  I also welcome the cross-party support for the proposal in the House and the broader universal support from agencies working in the area of child welfare.  Such a consensus is probably unique in the history of the State.</p><p>  Having everybody on the same side is not, however, without its own difficulties and challenges.  Above all, we must guard against any complacency in the lead-up to the referendum in terms of getting the information out to voters.  Other speakers have referred to the implications of the McKenna judgment and the requirement that equal coverage be given to both sides in any referendum campaign.  There is no room for complacency in this campaign and we must work to ensure a high turnout.  In this regard, I welcome the decision to hold the vote on a Saturday, a practice I hope will be continued in other referenda and general and local elections.  It will be particularly helpful to students who live away from home during the week, many of whom will have strong views on this issue.  I urge everybody to exercise their right to vote on the proposal.</p><p>  The objective of the proposed amendment is to ensure that children are visible, protected, listened to, cherished and valued in our society.  In striving to meet that objective, it was important that the proposal should reaffirm the special protection afforded to the family in our society.  In the vast majority of cases, the best place for children, as we all acknowledge, is within a loving and supportive family home.  The proposal seeks to address the minority of cases where children are not protected, heard, valued and cherished, children who, in the past, were forced to suffer in silence.  The amendment will afford children in that minority a second chance.  It was also important that care was taken to ensure the rights and duties of parents are not adversely affected by the proposal.  The Government is to be commended on getting the balance right in this regard.</p><p>  The amendment seeks to protect the minority of children in our society whose plight has too often been ignored.  People were outraged at the revelations in the Kilkenny case, Roscommon case, Kelly Fitzgerald case and many others.  When the publicity died down after a few weeks, however, nothing was actually done.</p><p>I am glad the referendum will result in change by offering citizens an opportunity to insert in the Constitution certain rights and protections for children.  Given that 30,000 child protection concerns were reported to the welfare services, including 1,600 child welfare concerns, this is clearly a major issue.</p><p> I am pleased to note an extensive information programme will be rolled out by the Government.  We all have a responsibility to get our message across.  Given that so many people are on one side of the debate, it is unlikely that all the issues will be teased out in full on television and radio.  We must ensure sufficient information is available to ensure citizens are informed when they cast their vote on 10 November.  I strongly support the proposed constitutional amendment. </p></speech>

This is vital and entirely worthy legislation.  As other speakers - including the Minister - indicated, it constitutes a firm commitment by the Government to protect children, support families and treat all children equally.  The Bill is the culmination of immense work by the offices of the Minister and the Attorney General.  In producing the proposed constitutional amendment, the Minister and Attorney General are addressing and meeting the needs of those within our community who are most vulnerable and, sadly, often without a voice.</p><p>  I encourage everyone to read the documentation in its entirety.  I will take this opportunity to examine sub-article 2.2Â° and focus on a couple of words in particular.  The sub-article states: &quot;In exceptional cases, where the parents, regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected, the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&quot;  The two phrases which are worthy of further emphasis are &quot;the safety or welfare of children&quot; and the description of the State as &quot;guardian of the common good&quot;.  As a parent and citizen of the State, I, like everyone else, have been horrified by reports that have emerged in the recent past.  The cases in question are all the more difficult to understand when I see the unbridled joy and innocence on the faces of children in schools throughout my constituency, including in Ballapousta, Tallanstown, Ballmackenny and the Bay Estate in Dundalk, where my children attended school.  As recently as last week I visited Scoil Mhuire gan SmÃ¡l in Kilsaran and again witnessed the sheer joy and endless capacity of children to give and impart love.  I have focused on the words &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;the common good&quot; because if Deputies witnessed what I and President Michael D. Higgins did last week in Kilsaran, they too would find it inconceivable that anyone could harm children.  For the common good and the good of all children in the State now and in the future, I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment.</p></speech>

Immediately after its publication, the Fianna FÃ¡il Party stated clearly that we fully support the referendum and will campaign strongly for a "Yes" vote.  My colleague and party spokesperson on children, Deputy Robert Troy, has submitted three amendments which we believe   will strengthen the proposed wording.  Throughout this debate, my party will take a totally constructive approach to this important issue both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  The amendments we have tabled have the capacity to strengthen the provision and afford greater protection to children.</p><p>  I am particularly glad the referendum will be held on its own and will not coincide with other referendums or elections.  As I outlined approximately one year ago in the House and in conversations with the Minister, it would not be advisable to put this important question before the people alongside any other referendum or election.  The Taoiseach had suggested in early 2011 that the referendum could be held with the presidential election of October 2011 or alongside other referendums.  I am pleased this has not occurred and that only one issue will be put to the people.  This issue is of such importance that unrelated issues should not be brought into the debate. </p><p>  We had plenty of commentary, not all of it accurate, both inside and outside the House about the delay in finalising the wording of the referendum and putting the proposal before the people.  Regardless of which party or parties comprised the Government, I have always advocated the need to achieve the best and strongest possible wording to ensure the basic rule of law of the country - namely, the Constitution - can facilitate the necessary legislative measures to achieve the objectives of all Members of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  Substantial work has been done over a number of years by many people in public life, non-governmental organisations and the public and Civil Service to prepare for a referendum.  In noting the substantial improvements that have taken place in rolling out services for children, I do not underestimate the major deficiencies that remain in this area.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, referred to the unfortunately large number of cases involving abuse of children and a failure to protect their rights.  All of us recall being shocked and horrified at these reports.  I recall my late colleague, Mr. Brian Lenihan, stating that we should not underestimate the major responsibility that rests on all of us who seek to strengthen the position of the child in our Constitution.  The burden of persuasion in any referendum is a heavy one and all the greater when the proposal relates to the delicate and intimate relationships that exist between child, parent, family and State.</p><p>  The fundamental law of the land, Bunreacht na hÃireann, should reflect our commitment to value and protect childhood.  Provision must be made in our Constitution for children to be protected from maltreatment, neglect or abuse.  The Constitution must require that we protect the welfare of the child and enable us to implement the necessary legislative measures to achieve these objectives.</p><p>  For many years, there have been justified calls from many quarters to strengthen children's rights, including calls for an amendment to the Constitution to reflect the rights of children.  In 1996, it was recommended in the report of the Constitution Review Group that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle and provide an express guarantee of certain other children's rights deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In January 2006, the All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution recommended in its review of the articles dealing with the family that a new section be inserted in Article 41 dealing with the rights of children.</p><p>  In September 2006, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, led the Irish delegation at the United Nations committee hearing on Ireland's second report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The committee expressed concern that some of the recommendations that had previously been made had not yet been fully addressed, particularly those relating to the status of the child as a holder of rights.  The then Taoiseach stated later in 2006 - I believe it was in November - that a referendum on children's rights should take place.  The Minister of State was asked to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the other DÃ¡il parties and all relevant interest groups with the aim of achieving consensus on the wording of an appropriate constitutional amendment.  My understanding is that an extensive round of consultations was held, and the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was published in February 2007.  The Bill proposed a wording to amend the Constitution in respect of children's rights.</p><p>That particular Bill sought to repeal Article 42.5 of the Constitution and insert a new Article 42A.  The proposed text incorporated several separate proposals covering areas such as the imprescriptible rights of the child, adoption, collection and exchange of information on persons who are a risk to children, and absolute and strict liability for offences against children.</p><p> The electoral cycle had moved on and the programme for Government agreed in June 2007 included a commitment to &quot;establish an all-party committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to deepening consensus on this matter&quot;.  The power to change our Constitution rests with the people alone and sovereignty rests in the people.  Time and again, the people of our State have demonstrated their strong attachment to the Constitution.  Proposing an amendment to the Constitution puts an onus on all of us to ensure the appropriate wording is presented.  It goes without saying we all want to see the best possible safeguards and protection for our children.</p><p> Substantial and long overdue legislation has been enacted, particularly since the late 1990s, including the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, the Sex Offenders Act 2001, the establishment of the Garda central vetting unit in 2002, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, the Children Act 2001, the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Act 2000, the Children Act 1997, the Adoption Act 2010 and the publication of the revised Children First guidelines in December 2009.  Those various legislative measures were brought before the Oireachtas by Ministers of different political parties over the years.  It also showed the significant deficiency in the legislative base in this area.  Another important development was the establishment of the Office of Ombudsman for Children.  This officeholder is not appointed by the Minister or the Oireachtas but by UachtarÃ¡n na hÃireann, which denotes the status and the importance of the work this office and its officials do.</p><p> I served briefly as Minister with responsibility for children's affairs in 2007 and 2008.  In October 2007, I advised DÃ¡il Ãireann that it was intended to establish a Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children to further the proposal to amend the Constitution in respect of children's rights.  I believe the establishment of this committee was another important step towards ensuring the legal framework adequately values, respects and protects the rights of children.  The then Government was adamant that the terms of reference meet with the agreement of the Opposition parties.  I worked with the then Fine Gael spokesperson on children's affairs, Deputy Shatter, the then Labour spokesperson on constitutional matters, Deputy Howlin, and Sinn FÃ©in's spokesperson, Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in, on agreed terms of reference.  The launch of this committee was the culmination of a great deal of deliberation, discussion and agreement both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  From the start, I emphasised very clearly the absolute need to deepen consensus on the matter.  There was constructive dialogue, deliberation and work among all committee members.  The committee had a very tight timeframe to report back to the Oireachtas, and it quite rightly sought extensions on several occasions to continue its work.</p><p> The terms of reference of the committee did not confine its deliberations to Oireachtas Members.  Provision was made for both oral and written submissions to the committee to ensure an input from people working outside the Oireachtas.  Current Ministers including Deputies Noonan, Fitzgerald, Shatter and Howlin were members of the committee, as well as other Members who are now retired.  All contributed to an area of significant complexity, as was evident from those outside groups that presented to the committee.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, earlier paid tribute to the chairman of the joint committee, Ms Mary O'Rourke.  I want to pay tribute to all committee members for their enthusiasm and diligence, as well as their commitment to ensuring the best possible protection for our children in this State.</p><p> I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and the holding of the referendum in early November.  Fianna FÃ¡il will be strong advocates of this amendment.  I also want to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Barry Andrews, who did enormous and positive work in contributing to this proposed amendment.</p></speech>

I passionately believe that we as legislators have an obligation to protect that precious place that is childhood.  In the past we failed collectively as a society.  Now is our chance to rectify that and stand united in this effort.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work of the late Ms Mary Rafferty who, in 1999, brought to our screens the horror of what so many of our children went through in industrial schools.  Her programme, &quot;States of Fear&quot;, led to widespread horror at the depth of abuse, both physical and emotional, that some of our citizens were put through.  Last year, I had the honour of presenting Ms Christine Buckley, one such survivor of this abuse, with the Labour Party's Evelyn Owens award.  Mary Rafferty's follow-up programme in 2002, &quot;Cardinal Secrets&quot;, then documented how those in leadership roles failed to investigate or deal with complaints of abuse.  However, what is equally distressing is how it also detailed the then political establishment's failure to protect those in the State's care.</p><p>  Let us never be found guilty of such failings again.  Let us work together in protecting children.  Many issues will divide us in this House but this is not one of them.  I include in that reference the children currently housed in direct provision centres as their parents await decisions on asylum applications.  They too need protection and I hope the Minister will ensure adequate safeguards are in place so that in 15 years' time we do not see similar horrific scenes on our televisions about abuse.</p><p>  The move by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to put in place legal requirements on mandatory reporting through the upcoming Children First legislation is most welcome, as is the imminent creation of a national children and family support agency.  Alone, however, these moves are not enough.  We need a cultural shift in which children are put at the heart of our social agenda.  This referendum is the beginning in creating that dialogue as it sets down a legal minimum standard.  The Constitution needs to be amended so that there is a general recognition and affirmation of the rights of the child.  We need to ensure there is provision for the State to intervene in those very rare cases in which a child's parents have failed to protect him or her.  We need the Constitution to treat all children equally regardless of whether their parents are married.  We need to be certain that when proceedings affect children, their best interests are paramount in achieving a resolution.</p><p>Finally, we need to ensure that the views of children are sought and considered in any proceedings affecting them.</p><p><br /> Last week I wrote a column for <i>thejournal.ie</i>about the long road this referendum has taken.  Since 2007 there have been three different wordings proposed for a possible constitutional amendment.  The wording before us tonight is the fourth such proposal.  We have spent the last decade trying to make this amendment perfect.  In using the term &quot;we&quot; I am referring to all of my colleagues in all political parties and those not in any party who have served the people during the past ten years.</p><p><br /> In 2007 the then Minister of State with responsibility for children proposed that Article 42.5 of the Constitution be deleted and replaced with a new article that affirmed the &quot;natural and imprescriptible rights of all children&quot;.  Later that year the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established to agree an all-party consensus.  This committee met 62 times over a period of 27 months and produced three reports.  The final of these reports, in 2010, proposed different wording to strengthen children's constitutional rights.  More recently, in 2011, a third wording was agreed but never formally published by the Minister, who had been appointed in 2008.  However, with the arrival of the troika and the change of Government in 2011 this issue was sidetracked and the task to put this to bed fell to the new Government and the new Minister.</p><p><br /> It is clear that before we set out to take on this challenge a significant amount of work had already been done on this issue and that should be acknowledged.  Given the care that was shown by previous officeholders and the work that has been done by this Government and the last Government, we prioritised this measure as a stand-alone referendum to ensure that the debate could be clear and focused.  It was also decided to hold the referendum on a Saturday to give maximum opportunity to all citizens to have their voices heard.  It is crucial that those voting for the first time have the chance to help to bury the painful legacy of the past and to make history for our children.</p><p><br /> I am honoured to serve on the Labour Party's campaign committee on this issue alongside my colleagues, Deputies White and Conway and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch.  I look forward to working with those from all sides of the House to get this referendum passed.  I hope that we will continue the debate on children's rights and child protection indefinitely in order that we ensure that we protect childhood for everyone.  My long-term hope is that, as legislators, we can create a culture of listening and that children's views can to be taken into account in all aspects of their lives.  This amendment empowers Members to draft and pass legislation to copper-fasten the rights of the child and mop up the anomalies in our law.  I look forward to working with everyone here as well as the NGO sector to continue the advancement of children's rights in future.  Childhood is precious and I am proud to be a part of the political system that has finally woken up to this fact.</p></speech>

Her work has introduced measures for the recognition of children, in particular the referendum on the 31st amendment of the Constitution.  This was promised but not delivered by the last Government but has been accomplished by this Government and that is important.  The rights and protection of children under our Constitution must be of paramount importance.  I emphasise that I believe these rights extend to the unborn as well.  I have made my position clear in respect of any attempt to introduce abortion to this country, a measure to which I am totally opposed.  The recognition of children as individuals with individual rights is a significant step forward in the creation of a society based on equality for all.  Although the amendment, which has been so carefully worded, will not be the cure-all sought at the most extreme level of expectation, it will go a long way towards it.  We are now presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our children that will resonate for years to come.  That we do so under the cloud of the revelations of terrible abuse, which has shocked our nation to the core, is a strong incentive, if one were needed, to ensure that childhood is protected in every possible way.</p><p>  While idealistic aspirations are often at odds with reality, I am confident that the Government will do its utmost to ensure that the optimum protection and respect will be accorded to children in the State.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will direct and underpin the actions of the courts in interpreting the constitutional provision now under consideration which the electorate will have the right to accept or reject on 10 November.</p><p>  Given the influences that children are subjected to in the 21st century, not the least of which are social networks, it is essential that any provision for their protection goes beyond the historical and somewhat narrow provisions.  The issues faced by young people today could not possibly have been envisaged under the provision of the 1937 Constitution.  Any amendment to the Constitution is likely to remain in place for a long time and, as such, must be far-sighted.  While I am aware that the amendment does and must provide for the adoption of the children of married parents, this area is fraught with pitfalls.  Like any other provision, there is a danger that bureaucracy and opportunity could lead in the long term to the unjust suffering of children and their parents, rather than providing the desired protection.</p><p>  Let us consider the position in the United Kingdom.  The system of so-called child protection there has led to accusations of secret family courts, reporting restrictions and child care scandals.  The heart-breaking reality is that reported excessive zeal by social services is leading to children being removed from parental care in situations where no abuse or neglect has taken place.  Parents are often afraid to take their children to hospital following an accident in case they are accused of deliberately harming a child.  This situation arises in all socioeconomic groupings of people and money and educational or professional status are no protection in these areas.  Last week the adoption of a baby boy, whose parents were accused of battering him leading to broken bones, was halted as evidence of congenital rickets and a vitamin D deficiency was presented.  After a three year battle the parents of the child have finally been given the chance to get their son back.  They are the lucky ones.  Records in the UK show numerous cases of supposed child abuse leading to children being removed from their parents and put up for adoption.  Even if the supposed abuse has been proven to be false, the children are not returned in many cases because adoptions have gone ahead and cannot be undone.  In another case highlighted last year a mother lost her son and daughter, both under the age of 12 years.  She was not prosecuted for any kind of abuse and had committed no crime.  She does not smoke, drink or take drugs and does not suffer from mental illness.  She was described as a kind and loving mother.  However, because of psychological vulnerability during a time of stress the social services decided that the children were at risk of significant harm.  These cases are only the tip of the iceberg.  It is important at this juncture when legislation and constitutional amendment will make provision for our children's health, happiness and essential rights, that bureaucracy does not develop in a way that, in the long term, will work against the very ideals that we seek to achieve.</p><p>  It is admirable that this Government has prioritised the protection of children and has, under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, done more to advance this legislation and the setting of a date for the children's rights referendum than all the talk of the last Government.</p><p>I am also confident that, in co-operation with her Cabinet colleagues, she can ensure that children are given special protection that will keep them safe, from both abuse and perceived abuse.</p><p> In tandem with children's rights, parents must have confidence that, in looking after their children to the best of their ability, they too will be protected.  I never want to see headlines such as &quot;Social Services took my Child&quot; and &quot;Child Care Scandals&quot; in this country.  The most basic right is that a child will, except in the most extreme cases, be entitled to know, love and be brought up by his or her own parents.  We can say that this is obvious and that any provision will only be in respect of proven and threatening cases, yet if we look at the issue of the introduction of divorce in Ireland, the initial thinking of everyone was that it would only apply in the Irish context to the most extreme situations.  However, since 2006, 90,000 divorces were obtained in this country.  This is a considerable number.  Abortion legislation in the UK and other countries was enacted initially with strict provisions.  These have been watered down over years to the current position where abortion on demand, indeed, on the most flimsy of pretexts, is very much the norm, and we never want to see it introduced here in this country.</p><p> This brings me on to another important issue, which perhaps comes under the Minister for Justice and Equality's remit, that is, cyber-bullying.  We must bring forward legislation to stop electronic bullying or intimidation through the Internet.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It is a new phenomenon and a 21st century issue.  Technology has now made it easier for bullies to get away with it and we must direct schools and IT literate persons to adopt policies prohibiting cyber-bullying.  Children or young adults can go online to create a cyber-personality for themselves by posting messages, videos, their interests and likes and dislikes on sites, and it is cheaper than texting.  Also, it is anonymous.  Indeed, it can cast decent people in a poor light.  This is also an issue that needs to be addressed and no doubt the Cabinet will do so during the term of this Government.</p><p> Our children are our future.  It is up to us to ensure that they are protected and that they can enjoy the childhood they deserve with loving families around them.  Good child care facilities are central pillars in our society.  The Minister is committed to prioritising the delivery of quality community child care, paid parental leave and improved direct child care payments to families.</p><p> Community care facilities need to be supported.  I had the pleasure of accompanying Deputy Fitzgerald when she visited the midlands - Longford, Athlone and Mullingar, and, indeed, many small villages in between - last year when she became Minister.  It probably reminded her of the Seanad campaign she undertook with me a number of years ago.  She got a great insight into how communities gel and how they look after and support community child care facilities.  It is important that such child care facilities are supported 100%.  No doubt we have the Minister in place who will battle extremely hard to ensure there are budgets for those facilities.</p><p> In a nutshell, this is an important piece of legislation.  It will foster a new attitude to children and reform the adoption laws and, indeed, support families and protect children and make them visible, and ensure decisions for children in their best interests.  I thank the Minister sincerely for bringing forward this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#VV00200"><p>Like other Members, I welcome the publication of the proposed wording of this amendment to the Constitution.  It has taken 20 years, 17 major reports into child-protection failings and repeated promises from successive Governments to get this far.</p><p>  As the House will be aware, Irish society has fundamentally changed since the Constitution was first written and I welcome this proposed reform.  Hopefully, it will ensure, for the first time ever, that the State will recognise the rights of children as individuals and not only as part of a family.  It is extremely important that the child can be recognised as a full citizen of the State, within and separate from the family.</p><p>  While the wording of the Government's proposed amendment is not exactly in line with what was agreed at the cross-party Oireachtas joint committee, I welcome that it goes a long way to achieve the committee's shared objectives.</p><p>  The question facing us, as legislators, is whether the final wording of the amendment be strong enough to ensure that it will protect all the children in the State from official neglect and abuse.  We all hope that it will become the keystone of one of the most important commitments laid out in the 1916 Proclamation of which other Members spoke, to &quot;cherish all the children of the nation equally&quot;, and ensure that becomes a reality.</p><p>  When I first came into this House a number of years ago, I took part in discussions on legislation on children with special needs.  The aspiration of those of us who took part in that debate and all the different groups that came in was that the legislation would pave the way to improve matters for children with special needs and their parents.  One of the most important points we made at the time was that they would only be aspirations unless the Government followed through with resources and supports for those families and, unfortunately, many families have been left in the situation where the child has been left without those supports.  It is important that we have these rights written in the Constitution but unless they are written in stone and the supports are in place, we fail children once again.</p><p>  Later we will discuss other children, those in the institutions etc., who we failed in the past and I welcome the fact that we will have another opportunity to reflect on that.  We in this House would all accept that we failed many of those children in the past, we are failing children at present and the important point coming out of this is that we must not fail children in the future.</p><p>  The amendment is designed to ensure that the interests of the child will be paramount in any court proceedings taken by the State relating to child protection, adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  While it is a welcome development to enshrine this in the Constitution, the Government must place the welfare of children to the forefront of their minds and review their harsh cuts to social services and overall austerity measures, which are detrimental to the well-being of vast numbers of children across the State.</p><p>  Recent figures from the CSO's &quot;Survey on Income and Living Conditions&quot; show that more than 200,000 children across the country are living in poverty.  This is an increase of 30,000 from two years ago.  This is happening under the Government's watch - 30,000 extra children in poverty.  Conditions can be linked directly to the decision to turn private debt into sovereign debt.  It is unacceptable that the Government is standing idly by while thousands of children live in poverty, and this report suggests that the number is rapidly increasing.</p><p>  While the Government proposes to introduce more harsh austerity measures, including cutbacks on social welfare, education and health which impact on the well-being of children, one in four between the ages of 12 to 17 is living below the poverty line according to the CSO.</p><p>  The CSO report also states that if social welfare allowances were excluded from the survey, 38% of households nationwide would be at risk of poverty.  This clearly shows the importance of welfare schemes and transfers in protecting families from the poverty trap.  I know at first-hand the number of families who are struggling to make ends meet at the end of the week in the current atmosphere of drastic cuts on social spending and tax increases which are affecting the most vulnerable.</p><p>People are already at breaking point trying to pay household charges, yet we see major residential energy price increases.  This will inevitably see more families dragged further into fuel poverty where they will have to choose between paying for basic household items or living in a home that is heated.  It was only the relatively mild winter we had last year that saved many people from the dangers of fuel poverty, but the concern is that fuel poverty will happen.  While the Government is focusing on legislating to protect children, it must also ensure that its policies do not endanger the well-being of children by pushing their families further into poverty.</p><p><br /> In the same week the wording to the amendment was published, the Irish Refugee Council published a report entitled: State Sanctioned Child Poverty and Exclusion.  The report dealt with the shocking conditions and treatment that children of asylum seekers now face.  It highlighted in shocking detail the major overcrowding issue in direct provision centres in which asylum seekers are accommodated and indicated that children staying in them are at serious risk of malnourishment.  There are currently 5,098 people in State-provided direct provision centres and over one-third of these, 1,789, are children.  Some were born in or have lived their whole lives in Ireland, as processing for asylum seekers takes anywhere from one to seven years.  Due to overcrowding issues, these centres pose a risk to the well-being of children.</p><p><br /> According to a report from the special rapporteur for children, Geoffrey Shannon, there is a &quot;real risk&quot; of child abuse in direct provision centres because single parents and their children sometimes have to share a room with strangers.  In addition, sometimes the families of teenage children of opposite genders are required to share one room.  Given the history of child abuse in State run institutions here, the Government</p><p>should tackle this problem immediately to ensure that no child, no matter its nationality, is under threat while in State care.  The State is also failing to provide many families with enough nutritious food.  The report states:<blockquote> Lack of appropriate food and the inability of parents to provide food for their children is a common theme in residents' lives in direct provision.  The result of the inadequate provision of food has been: instances of malnutrition among children and expectant mothers, ill-health related to diet among babies and young children, weight loss among children, hunger among adults (as a result of family rationing) and chronic gastric illness among children of all ages.</blockquote>This is unacceptable.  It reads like a description of the conditions from which many of these families were trying to escape.  I agree with the recommendations of the Irish Refugee Council's report, which call for an independent inquiry into the long list of complaints, grievances and child protection issues reported by residents and children of the State-run direct provision centres for asylum seekers.</p><p><br /> Passing this referendum will not ensure that children are fully protected in our society.  The Government also needs to protect children whose well-being is threatened by socioeconomic factors and those children in the care of the State.  While the amendment to the Constitution is welcome, it will not change that fact that Government policies continue to place thousands of children at risk every day.  Deputy Flanagan spoke earlier about the Children's Rights Alliance and a child-centred approach that would allow the thousands of children in State care the opportunity of a loving and stable family home and about ensuring that judges listen to children when a decision is to be made in a court or family case.  We have the opportunity now to move beyond child abuse.</p><p><br /> I look forward to the referendum and to discussing the issues on the doorsteps with constituents.  People should vote &quot;Yes&quot; on this.  I do not agree with those in the &quot;No&quot; camp on this, although I accept the view that we could make stronger recommendations.  Perhaps we should be moving towards not only poverty-proofing many policies but towards child-proofing them.  I look forward to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs being the champion of this and hope she will ensure that legislation coming before the House will be child-proofed so as to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes made by society, the State and the Government with regard to children in the past.</p><p><br /> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and I hope to speak later on tonight on the issue of the hurt still being created in people's lives due to our failure to legislate with regard to those hurt in the past.  I hope and pray - not something I do very often - that we do not return to this in 20 years and find families and children in the same situation we have had in the past.  This amendment is a genuine effort by the Minister, the Government and those who sat on the committee to deliver for children.  Hopefully, we have it right this time.</p></speech>

Over past years, we have let down the children of Ireland and have allowed children's lives be ruined and destroyed.  The delay in bringing forward a referendum on children's rights has resulted in many children facing danger, abuse and sometimes death.  Our TÃ¡naiste was right when he stated that some of the darkest moments in our past are a direct consequence of ignoring children's interests and their rights to be cared for and protected.</p><p>  It is over 20 years since Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness called for a referendum to enshrine the rights of children in our Constitution.  Many academics and children advocates also pleaded with previous Governments for a referendum.  This Government is listening and reacting and it seeks to protect our young and vulnerable.  I am proud to be part of this Government, a Government which cares and which will listen to children and give a voice to them in our Constitution.  This Government appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who has done Trojan work to bring this referendum to the people.  The referendum proposes to put the child at the centre of Bunreacht na hÃireann.  It is a statement of how we value and cherish the children of our State.  The majority of parents look after their children.  This referendum is not about them, but about the parents who do not nurture and protect their children.</p><p>  During my years as a teacher and school principal, I attended many teacher conferences, meetings and staff meetings at which many teachers expressed concern for children in their care.  Some arrived at school unwashed, some arrived hungry and some arrived as vacant, exhausted shells.  Indeed, some arrived as all of these with all life and sparkle drained from them.  This referendum will facilitate those cases where children are abused or neglected within their families.  It will allow the State to step in more quickly to protect them.  This is a very welcome development.</p><p>  During my work in the education sector, I met children who were fostered and their foster parents.  It was plain to see that these children were adored, cherished and loved.  However, there was something missing, a piece of the jigsaw lost.  They did not fully belong and there was an endless fear that the dream would end soon and that the child would have to leave.  Often, the real heartbreak for the foster parents was the knowledge of the situation to which the child would return. </p><p>They had to watch the child they adored, cherished and loved return to parents who neglected, abused and dismissed the child.  Some of these parents were incapable of looking after themselves due to problems with drink, drugs or mental illness.  Forthcoming legislation will allow the children of married parents to be adopted.  More than 1,600 children are currently living in institutions or with foster parents because of the value placed on the family in our Constitution.  We need to make it clear that the new Article 42A of the Constitution still acknowledges that the best place for the child is in the family home.  This is the case in the majority of instances.  If this referendum is passed, children will have recognised rights and the safety and welfare of children will be at the centre of decision-making.  The inclusion of the proposed Article 42A in the Constitution will mean that the family will have to share its pedestal with children.  A balancing act will have to be performed.  This is only right and proper.  Hillary Clinton has said that "every child needs a champion".  On 10 November next, we should all become champions for our sons and daughters and for those children who are seen by few and heard by even fewer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1053" speakername="Anthony Lawlor" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#XX00200"><p>Approximately six weeks ago, my staff made an appointment for a woman to come to visit me.  I thought it was a routine case of someone looking for assistance with an application for disability allowance.  When the woman sat down in front of me, I heard the horrific tale of how her daughter was abused approximately 25 years ago.  As a result of this abuse, her daughter started to look inward and become depressed.  She turned to alcohol and currently resides in the psychiatric ward in Naas hospital.  As I listened to the details of what happened to this young girl, it struck me that the abuse, which was a physical and traumatic experience at the time, has affected her ever since.  Her entire life has been destroyed as a result of half an hour's bad experience with someone she trusted.  That is why I feel that the constitutional amendment we are putting before the people is so important.  We have to protect people like this young woman, who trusted someone but was abused by that person.  We can do something to alleviate the sorts of problems that might be encountered by children in the future.  The woman in this case will suffer for the rest of her life, sadly, but many others can be saved if we agree to amend the Constitution as proposed in this legislation.  The pain of abuse will be taken from them.</p><p>  I emphasise that we are talking about a small number of people.  Virtually all children live in loving and caring families.  When I researched this issue, I learned that one third of young children in foster care are being looked after by relatives.  During the summer, I heard that the sister of a woman who had ended up in psychiatric care took on the responsibility of looking after her four children.  The problem I dealt with was in ensuring the State could give this family as much assistance as possible.  The broader family unit stepped in to help the mother when she required such assistance.  I hope the four children will be back with their mother shortly when she has herself sorted out.  We have a duty to ensure that sort of care and feeling is reflected in our Constitution.</p><p>  The Minister was right when she said that this amendment, although helpful now, will be of particular benefit to future generations.  It will help us to prevent the small number of abusive people in society from abusing children.  It will allow us to help children as much as possible. That is why I warmly welcome the Bill before the House, which has been in fermentation for a long period of time.  One of the first committees to examine this issue and produce a report on it was established 20 years ago.  I must say that great work was done by former colleagues of the Deputies on the other side of the House, including Mary O'Rourke and Barry Andrews.  In 2007, a joint committee proposed many of the ideas that have been taken on board by the Minister in proposing this amendment to the Constitution.  It is sad that it took so long, but by reading those reports and reflecting on their positive aspects, I think we have got it right.</p><p>  When this proposal was being drawn up, great consideration was given to the central role the family plays in a child's life.  We should try to keep every child in his or her family, where possible.  I welcome the adoption Bill that is associated with this proposal.  According to an information document on that Bill which I have read, the policies and practices of those who are working with children now, including HSE professionals like care workers and social workers, place a focus on keeping the child in the family to the greatest extent possible.  Those professionals provide support to parents as well.  It is important that the State gives as much assistance as possible to those who have difficulty with the skill of parenting.  The last thing anyone wants to do is to remove a child from its family.  I mentioned earlier that the broader family often comes to the help of young children.</p><p>  I am glad that foster families are being recognised.  Many children go into foster care for short periods of time - perhaps two or three months.  It does not help children to be moved from one foster family to another.  Stability, in its various forms, is the most important thing for a young person as he or she is growing up.  Many couples who have children of their own are willing to foster another child.  Some of them would love to be able to adopt that child if his or her biological family is not capable of looking after him or her.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the legislation will give a foster parent who has cared for a child for five, six or seven years an opportunity to adopt that child.  I am also pleased that the voice of the child is being heard.  The Minister mentioned that many of the adoptions taking place within foster families involve children of 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  They are mature at that stage.  They are able to make their own decisions and life choices.  They are allowed to vote at 18.  They are allowed to consent to have sex at 16.  It is disappointing that these young people have not been heard before now when they have said they want their futures to be with their foster families.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister on the work she has done so far to prepare for the referendum.  I am delighted that there is cross-party support for the proposal.  I look forward to canvassing for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on 10 November next.</p></speech>

I am always appreciative of speaking time in this House but I am particularly grateful to be able to speak today on an issue that is particularly close to my heart.  The cornerstone of any democracy is its constitution.  Equality should be the foundation of our democracy.  As a result of this legislation, we will finally give our children the protection of our Constitution.  I do not think anybody can object to that.  Over 30 years have passed since the then Senator Mary Robinson first expressed the need for constitutional change for children.  In the intervening period, a series of official reports have made the case for strengthening children's rights at constitutional level.</p><p>These include the Kilkenny incest report in 1993; the Constitutional Review Group in 1996; the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in 2010; international authorities such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 1998 and again in 2006; and, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in 2007 and more recently in 2011.  As evidenced by the marches in support of victims of child abuse, the public appetite of the people for change is also clear.</p><p> It has taken this Government to have to courage to acknowledge the State's responsibility to children.  Upon taking office, the Government immediately made significant inroads into improving Ireland's child welfare and protection systems with the appointment of a senior Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which were big and important steps.  We have already seen momentum, with child protection reforms taking place, with the Child and Family Support Agency and the legislation on Children First, the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill.  All mark significant progress in the direction of Ireland's commitment to improving child protection and welfare and set Ireland on course to meeting the recommendations set out by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's in 2006.</p><p> We need laws that will protect children from harm and give them status as individuals.  Now, with the insertion of explicit children's rights into the Constitution, which had been mooted for a long time, the Fine Gael-Labour Government is keeping the promise to hold such a referendum, a children's referendum.  We will be voting to insert an article into the Constitution, as the Taoiseach said, &quot;dedicated entirely to children as individuals, as citizens in their own right&quot;.  For the first time in the history of the State, children will become more than just the property of their parents.</p><p> I would like to compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her Department on their work in getting this legislation ready.  She took time to get it right and it has been noticeable that the response to the wording from all corners of the spectrum has been welcoming, including from the Opposition.  We have had a plethora of reports highlighting the neglect, abuse and exploitation when children's voices were silenced and their best interests ignored.  Those working with and for children agree that constitutional change is required to ensure that children are fully protected in society and that their rights are taken into account in decisions made about their lives.</p><p> Why do we need a constitutional amendment to strengthen the rights of children?  At a minimum, the express and individual rights for children at constitutional level will reflect the value we place on our children in society and ensure that they are the focus in budgetary, political, administrative, legislative and other decisions affecting them.  The lack of recognition of the individual rights of the child has led to some poor judicial decisions affecting children.  Unlike cases involving children of unmarried parents, in cases involving children of marital families, due to the constitutional presumption in favour of the family under Article 41, no independent investigation can be undertaken as to the child's best interests in the court's decision making unless the exceptional circumstances outlined prevail.  A  key example of this is the &quot;Baby Anne&quot; case.</p><p> The Constitution allows discrimination to persist between children based on the marital status of their parents, with the strength of the rights afforded to children reliant on whether their parents are married or unmarried. The &quot;Baby Anne&quot; case is also a relevant example in this regard and shows how the rigid judicial interpretation of Articles 41 and 42 has impinged upon the effective operation of our child protection, care and adoption systems.</p><p> Children's rights are human rights, with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to the young.  With this referendum, we are acknowledging the move towards viewing child protection through the lens of children's rights, indeed, through a human rights lens.  The field of children's rights spans the fields of law, politics, religion, and morality.  Children in Ireland, as in many other European countries, were historically sidelined in society.  The State on its foundation in 1922 inherited a 1908 Act that was to be the main instrument for child protection for most of the 20th century until the enactment of the Child Care Act 1991.  The failure to amend and overhaul that legislation for more than 80 years speaks eloquently of how children were viewed.</p><p> The 1937 Constitution largely saw children in the context of the family, which was interpreted to mean only the marital family.  Children's rights were not considered.  That their voices were not heard, that their family ties were not respected, is now well recognised.  The lack of recognition and complete disregard for the human rights of children and young people inevitably led to a situation where policy focused on protecting the income of the institution, a State that did little or nothing to increase support to families in need.</p><p> Childhood is a precious time and does not last very long.  Children must be protected and their rights promoted to ensure they are consistently treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  The wording to be inserted into the Constitution is crucial to its success as it balances the rights of children with those of their parents.  Most significantly, the best interests of the child are to be the first and paramount consideration in the resolution of all disputes concerning the guardianship, adoption, custody, care or upbringing of a child.  Making children visible in the Constitution will help to foster a new legal landscape for children in Ireland.</p><p> Perhaps the greatest recent adjudication on the proposed amendment came from Ms Anne Rennison, who over 25 years has fostered six children long-term and 20 short-term.  She said on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; in recent days that the referendum will acknowledge the rights of children and hear the voice of children, the children who in the past and to this day are &quot;no longer safe&quot; in our society.  This is a chilling and tragic indictment of the way we have approached matters in the past.  In conclusion, if this amendment can prevent one more crime against a child, if it can make one child's life safe, if it can make one family more complete, then this House will have done a good day's work.</p></speech>

As was said, the amendment has been welcomed across the board and among the wider public, rightly so.  This is a tribute to the work the Minister has done to put together wording that is acceptable to everybody, which is as it should be.  There is no doubt the Irish people will on 10 November give the go-ahead to the amendment of the Constitution.  I would imagine there will be virtually unanimous support across the country in regard to protecting the rights of children and enshrining this in our Constitution.</p><p>  As the Minister said in her contribution yesterday, it has been a very long time coming, perhaps too long.  On 11 November, the work will really begin for those in the Oireachtas because there is no doubt the amendment will be passed and, when it is, we will have a job to do.  We need to make sure legislation reflects fully and builds on the amendment, and strengthens the protections for children and the rights of children into the future.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment is the legal minimum standard.  The Adoption (Amendment) Bill just published will go some way to enshrining those rights in regard to adoption and the rights of children but when we introduce other legislation, we need to go further.  There are proposals to put child protection on a legislative basis and we need to make sure that progresses as quickly as possible.  We also need a children Bill to be published that will fully enshrine and build further on the rights of children.  Comprehensive legislation on that basis will be vital for us.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment states that rights &quot;shall&quot; be enshrined, which is very important.  I pay tribute to the Minister for ensuring the word &quot;shall&quot; is included because it means we cannot duck our responsibility in this House and we will have to ensure we bring forward the legislation to protect the rights of children.  The fact the wording reflects the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is also important and builds this into the Constitution.  This can only strengthen the Constitution and make it better for all citizens, children in particular.</p><p>  The legislation we introduce after the referendum must ensure the best interests of children are reflected in all proceedings in regard to children, whether administrative or judicial, so children are foremost in people's minds when they make these decisions.  The views of children should be considered in any judicial proceedings.  I know that in some jurisdictions children are given legal representation with regard to adoption and other matters concerning them.  That is something we should put in place here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.482" nospeaker="true" time="10:50:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald on Tuesday, 26 September 2012:

That DÃ¡il Ãireann:

notes that this motion has been drawn up with a survivor centred ethos;

agrees with the State&#8217;s position, as articulated in DÃ¡il Ãireann in February 2002, that abuse occurred in the Magdalene Laundries, that the abuse was an appalling breach of trust and that

the victims of that abuse suffered and continue to suffer greatly; 

acknowledges the hurt and hardship caused by the exclusion of survivors of the Magdalene Laundries from the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme;

acknowledges that the Magdalene survivor population is predominantly aging and elderly;

acknowledges that survivor testimony records that women were made to work without pay, were kept behind locked doors and returned by gardaÃ­ if they attempted to escape;

welcomes the establishment of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Magdalene Laundries to clarify any State interaction with the Magdalene Laundries and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction;

notes the Irish Human Rights Commission document entitled Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the &#8220;Magdalene Laundries&#8221;;

notes the UN Committee Against Torture&#8217;s recommendations on the Magdalene Laundries, its insistence that the State ensure that survivors obtain redress and its grave concern at the failure by the State to institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations into the allegations of ill-treatment of the women;

further welcomes the public statement of June 2011 by four religious congregations which ran ten Magdalene Laundries expressing a willingness to bring greater clarity, understanding, healing and justice in the interests of all the women involved; 

further acknowledges that there is growing evidence of the State: 

&#8212; sending women and girls to the Magdalene Laundries;

&#8212; providing the religious orders with direct and indirect financial support; and

&#8212; failing to supervise the religious orders&#8217; operation of the Magdalene Laundries;

considers most serious the allegations of forced labour in the Magdalene Laundries, noting the incarceration and use of women and children as workers without pay would constitute forced labour under the 1930 Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation, which Ireland ratified in 1931, and accepts that the rejection and prohibition of slavery is a peremptory norm of international law; 

acknowledges the need for immediate and meaningful discussion on an apology and redress; 

commits to providing immediate funding for, and implementation of, a helpline for the survivors of the Magdalene Laundries;

commits to supporting survivors in accessing pensions that reflect their years of work in the Magdalene Laundries; and 

commits to an open and meaningful debate on the issue of an apology, redress and restorative justice measures once the Inter-Departmental Committee has reported.

Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:To delete all words after &#8220;DÃ¡il Ãireann&#8221; and substitute the following:

&#8220;acknowledges that the untold story of those women who were in Magdalene laundries needs to be listened to with compassion and the facts about the Magdalene laundries need to be established and made public;

is conscious of the need to respect the rights of all concerned;

notes that the Irish Human Rights Commission document entitled &#8216;Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the &#8220;Magdalene Laundries'&quot; in November 2010 had recommended in the context of a mechanism to investigate matters that:

&#8212; &#8216;such a mechanism should first examine the extent of the State&#8217;s involvement in and responsibility for:&#8212; the girls and women entering the laundries;

&#8212; the conditions in the laundries;

&#8212; the manner in which girls and women left the laundries; and

&#8212; end-of-life issues for those who remained&#8217;;welcomes the fact that this Government, shortly after taking office in 2011, decided to establish an interdepartmental committee on Magdalene laundries, chaired by an independent person, to establish the facts of State involvement in Magdalene laundries;

welcomes the fact that the religious congregations who ran the Magdalene laundries, those individuals who were in Magdalene laundries and their advocacy and representative groups have all engaged with the committee;

notes that Senator Martin McAleese, chairman of the committee, has recently advised that:&#8212; the committee has made excellent progress despite the considerable challenges faced;

and

&#8212; a significant level of information and documentation has been identified; however, relevant records continue to be identified by Government Departments and State agencies and the committee also continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups, with a submission in excess of over 100 pages only received from one such group as recently as 15 August 2012;agrees that it would be wrong for the committee to conclude its work without examining the additional material and welcomes the excellent progress made by the committee and the statement that the committee intends to present a substantial final report as soon as possible and at the latest before the end of this year; and

commits to an open and meaningful response once the interdepartmental committee has reported.&#8221; - (Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch).</p></speech>

I signed my name to it because what else could one do.  These people need justice and they need it before it is too late.  The longer we wait, the less likely it is that they will get justice.</p><p>  I started reading the report produced by Justice for Magdalenes and I must say it is very hard work to read it.  If it is hard work to read the report, it must have been absolute hell to exist as those people were forced to exist.  I consider myself very lucky that myself and my wife were not born 30 years earlier than we were because, given that my two children were born outside wedlock, my wife would probably have been put in care and my children taken away from me.  I would probably have ended up in England and everyone would have ended up miserable.  If one imagines oneself in that position and asks if one deserves justice, the answer is yes, of course.</p><p>  One particular story in the report stood out.  Often mothers and daughters were in the same facility and in one case, a mother was in the same chapel as her daughter, week after week but she was not told it was her daughter.  I am trying to understand how anyone could be so cruel as to do that to someone.  It is fairly obvious it was cruel.  It was fairly obvious to Deputy Shatter in December 2009 that it was wrong, when he said there was &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; that there was State complicity in the Magdalene laundries.  That is still true today and he needs to act on it today.</p></speech>

It is a register of the crimes committed by this State against women.  After reading the report, there can be no doubt that this was a deliberate social policy which was summed up in the report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor, which dealt with how the State handled births outside marriage.  A woman could be detained in a mother and baby home for a year if she had one child outside marriage.  If she had two children, she could be detained for two years and if she had any more, she could be detained for as long as the State deemed necessary.  The object was clearly defined thus: "...to regulate control according to individual requirements, or in the more degraded cases to segregate those who have become sources of evil, danger, and expense to the community."  How more horrendous could any sentence be?</p><p>  I read of one case where a girl was raped by her brother.  He was imprisoned for six years and she got life in a Magdalene laundry.  I also read of another woman, buried in Limerick, who spent 74 years in a laundry.  The report is a litany of degradation, imprisonment, violations of human rights and forced labour.  The evidence is irrefutable in this report.  The State was fully complicit in all of these activities through the capitation fees it paid on behalf of those who were on probation and sent to laundries.  It was complicit in the transferring of young women to the laundries from industrial schools.  There was no monitoring of the conditions in the laundries and the State fought against the application of the Factories Act, when it was introduced, to the laundries.  When the Act was applied, the State carried out no enforcement.  The State also interacted in the drawing up of the lucrative commercial contracts between the laundries and the Army, prison services and so forth.</p><p>  It is not good enough for the Government to say, &quot;wait, we will deal with it this year&quot;.  These people have already waited a lifetime.  Many of them cannot wait any more.  The UN Commission on Torture said over three months ago that this should have been dealt with.  This is an ageing population.  They deserve an apology now.  They deserve redress now.  I support the suggestion that these laundries were commercial enterprises and the reckonable service should be pensionable.  The money should be recovered in unpaid PAYE and PRSI contributions to foot the bill.  There should be no more excuses or delays.  This matter should be dealt with now.</p></speech>

The State is ultimately responsible for this.  The role of the religious orders and the church hierarchy is beyond question, in the way they used their twisted notions of morality to justify visiting appalling suffering, abuse and exploitation on tens of thousands women.  That is well known and beyond question.  However, it is the State that is ultimately responsible for the welfare of every citizen.  It is well documented that the State was directly and indirectly, through neglect and through turning a blind eye, responsible for allowing these horrors, this abuse, exploitation and enslavement to be inflicted on so many Irish women over decades.</p><p>  The State passed laws and took measures that directly underpinned the Magdalene laundry system.  The gardaÃ­ returned women who fled or escaped to these institutions.  The State provided direct and indirect financial support to the laundries and abdicated its duty of care to these women by failing to ensure that their human rights were vindicated.  All of this was done very deliberately by the State.  It essentially used the church and its institutions as a method of social control, for cynical economic and political reasons and for twisted notions of morality.  Against this context, it is shameful that this Government is continuing to delay giving these women the justice, acknowledgement and the compensation they deserve for the suffering they endured at the hands of the church and the State.  The Government has no excuse for further delay.  The survivors and victims have said they support the interdepartmental committee but it should not be used as an excuse to delay the apology and the redress that they deserve now.  The Government should give that to them tonight.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion.  This is not an issue on which the House should divide.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment and to allow this motion to be passed unanimously by the House.</p><p>  We must acknowledge that abuse occurred in Magdalene laundries.  The abuse was an appalling breach of trust and the victims of that abuse suffered, and continue to suffer, greatly.  We must acknowledge the hurt and the hardship caused by the exclusion of survivors of the Magdalene laundries from the residential institutions redress scheme.  We also need to recognise that the survivors are predominantly elderly.</p><p>  The survivor testimony itself records that women were made to work without pay, were kept behind locked doors and returned by gardaÃ­ if they attempted to escape.  The State had a role in this and we must acknowledge that there is now growing evidence that the State sent women and girls to the Magdalene laundries.  The State also provided the religious orders which ran the laundries with direct and indirect financial support.  It also failed abjectly to supervise the religious orders in the operation of the laundries.  On that basis I support the motion and again appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that everyone in the House must find it difficult to read the stories of the people concerned, the survivors.  The stark submission from the Magdalene group indicates that the State was involved in sending women and girls to the Magdalene laundries and ensuring that they remained there, in most cases without any statutory basis for doing so.  The State regarded the Magdalene laundries as an opportunity to deal with various social problems such illegitimacy, poverty, homelessness, disability, so-called eccentric behaviour, domestic and sexual abuse, youth crime and infanticide.  It failed to make its own provision for these problems and came to rely on the availability of the Magdalene institutions instead.</p><p> I find it harrowing also to note the timetable of events.  The Justice for Magdalenes group originally submitted its draft to the Government in July 2009.  It is three years since the Labour Party supported the redress scheme.  In December 2009 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform acknowledged that the State was complicit in referring women to Magdalene laundries.  In March 2011, when the Government came to power, the group submitted a restorative justice and reparation scheme to it, updating the scheme published in July 2009.  Fifteen months ago the UN Committee against Torture gave the State one year to obtain redress for survivors.  I find it difficult to credit the Minister of State's assertion last night that the call for an apology and a redress scheme was premature.  I accept that the wheels of democracy turn slowly but it was miraculous how quickly we were able to organise the bank bailout.  I accept Rome was not built in a day, but an immediate apology is required.</p></speech>

No one is capable of being an expert on every topic.  I feel comfortable informing myself to the best of my ability and forming a judgment, yet there are some topics, regardless of how much I read or how much research I do, that I feel I can never fully understand.  The Magdalene issue is one such topic.  Some facts are known and they are almost incomprehensible.  More than 30,000 women and girls were incarcerated in those institutions, enduring forced labour, brutal conditions and enforced confinement.  They lived with a cultural stigma that attached such deep shame that many begged to be sent to prison rather than to the laundries.</p><p><br />  As a representative for Galway West I thought it appropriate to read the following extract from the report of Justice for Magdalenes, which I re-read today.<blockquote>[T]he Mother Superior  of the convent operating the Magdalene Laundry in Galway in 1958 [said] that seventy per cent of the women in that Laundry were &#8220;unmarried mothers&#8221;.  [...] When asked whether a woman or girl could leave whenever she chose, the Mother Superior stated &#8220;No, we&#8217;re not as lenient as that.  The girl must have a suitable place to go.  [...] Some stay for life&#8221;.</blockquote>That the life of any person could be so flippantly treated, rights so casually abused and liberties so easily disregarded is horrifying.  When I was a member of Galway City Council the following motion was passed with unanimous support: &quot;That Galway City Council calls on the Government and the Catholic Church to (a) issue formal apologies for the abuse inflicted on women and young girls in the Magdalen Laundries and (b) establish a distinct redress scheme for all survivors.&quot;  I stand by those sentiments today.  They are the sentiments of the people of Galway.  The State cannot deny that it has a liability in the issue or that there was State complicity in the use of the laundries for those activities and that what was going on was known to the State in some fashion, at least enough to prove neglect and liability.</p><p><br />  I acknowledge the bravery and courage of those women who have campaigned for justice, not just for themselves but for others.  It cannot be easy.  The persistent reminder of the abuse they have suffered in the course of their campaign must be extremely difficult.  I accept the Government's request that Senator Martin McAleese and his committee be allowed finish their report so as to allow a full and proper debate.  I am told the report will be finished by the end of this year at the latest.  It is on that contention that I seek some satisfaction.  However, I warn that any delay beyond the end of the year would be utterly and completely unacceptable.</p></speech>

Recent decades have seen huge progress in Irish society in terms of assessing how the country's most vulnerable people were treated in past decades and an important part of that has been assessment of the circumstances of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries across the country.  Initially those institutions were designed as places of asylum for women and were found throughout Europe as well as in Canada and the United States.  However, by the early 20th century in Ireland, these centres had adopted a more prison-like regime, with enforced labour and long periods of silence.  Lest anyone think that these institutions belong to a dim and distant part of Ireland's past, the last Magdalene asylum closed in Waterford just 16 years ago in 1996.  Their presence was widely accepted although the residents of the institutions were rarely seen in public.  Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in, Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture all used the services of the laundries.  In her 2001 book on the subject, <i>Do Penance or Perish: A Study of Magdalene Asylums in Ireland</i>, Frances Finnegan suggests that it was the advent of the washing machine, as opposed to any moral outcry, that led to the demise of such institutions.  Survivors of the institutions report the prevalence of forced labour and the use of women and children as unpaid workers, all of which appear to contravene the 1930 Forced Labour Convention.</p><p><br />  The nation as a whole must reflect on the brutal treatment meted out to those women and the silence that surrounded the subject for many years.  Such an assessment must be carried out properly and deserves due consideration.  It is right and proper that the committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese is afforded until the end of the year to conclude its work and submit a final report.  Fifteen months ago the Government decided upon the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to consider the circumstances of the women and girls who lived in the institutions.  That was the correct decision to take as a first step to establishing the truth about what happened inside the walls of the institutions.  The proper course of action is that sufficient time is taken to produce the report.  After decades of silence, the very least we can do for the women and girls who lived in the institutions, often working for paltry or non-existent wages, is to give their cases the consideration they merit.  To rush the report would not provide justice to the women.  The time specified is not too long to allow for the production of such an important report, especially when one considers that the committee must review such institutions over a 90-year period and also that submissions by relevant representative groups were being made up to mid-August.  I endorse the Government's position on the report.  Senator McAleese and his colleagues on the interdepartmental committee must be afforded the necessary time to properly conduct the investigation and compile the results into a narrative that details the experience of the women.</p><p><br />  I note Deputy McDonald's statement that the women involved are ageing and are anxious to achieve closure on the issue, but to pre-empt the publication of such a report by making a decision in advance of its circulation would be wrong.  These forgotten women of Irish history, many of whom disappeared behind the high walls of those institutions for decades, deserve to have their stories told in a proper fashion and to have the matter explored properly in a way that respects their dignity while at the same time giving proper consideration to this important issue.</p></speech>

Just as we recall past glories and live off them, we cannot deny this part of our history, nor should we.  We must confront it, accept it as part of our story and deal with it.  While nobody should seek to shield those directly responsible, be they religious or lay, we cannot deny our culpability in that all of us have a collective guilt.  Our attitudes, silence and callous indifference all fed into the problem.  That is not for one moment to say that horrendous crimes were not committed by the people immediately involved in the institutions, but our collective guilt cannot be denied either.</p><p><br />  I understand the need for urgent action given the age and frailty of many of the victims.  I say to the Minister that our stance even in the interim, as of today and every day from now on, should be proactive in support of the women.  I presume it is, but it should be nothing short of fully proactive and helpful to the women, emotionally, psychologically, financially and in every practical way.  There is more than a <i>prima facie</i> case suggesting State involvement.</p><p>Last night's &quot;Prime Time&quot; provided the most recent assertion of the active use of the laundries as jails and the State's purchase of their services.  In itself, this meant complicity.  Nevertheless, it is worth waiting - although not indefinitely - for the interdepartmental report.  The interdepartmental committee has a prestigious chair in Senator McAleese, which lends it authority.  Its interim report would suggest it is being well co-operated with and that it is uncovering and collating evidence.  We know that <i>prima facie</i>evidence exists but the committee is bringing it together in an official report that has status.  I urge that the report should come out quickly and I ask the Minister to press for its publication at the earliest date possible.  I accept the point made about the frailty and age of those concerned and therefore the report should come out as soon as is humanly possible.  However, I side with the body of evidence that shows that although we should care immediately for the woman who, as victims, should now be cared for in every practical and conceivable way, the final redress should await the actual report.  This would turn the <i>prima facie</i>evidence into an actual commissioned report, with all the status that goes with that.  Then there must be real action, which should involve an apology and so forth.</p><p><br /> We all need this.  It will be good for the body politic, for society, for every player involved and for all of us in the country who are collectively guilty.  We need a truth and reconciliation process similar to the South African process that followed apartheid, a truth and reconciliation forum to be established to tell the Magdalene story.  It is a sordid part of our history.  We cannot romanticise our past and ignore this.  Only by looking holistically at our history will we benefit as a people and evolve into a better society with more humane principles and more proper values.</p><p><br /> I appeal to those who proposed the motion.  I commend Sinn FÃ©in on introducing it.  It is an excellent use of Private Members' time; that is my genuine belief.  Although I commend its introduction, I appeal to the Members to refrain from pre-empting the outcome of the report.  They should urge the earliest possible publication of the report and for all speed and all resources to be given to the committee.  I do not believe they should pre-empt the committee's final report.  It has a prestigious chair and because it is acting as an interdepartmental body, its report will be decisive and authoritative.  I appeal to Sinn FÃ©in to consider this, pull back the motion and accept the Government amendment on that basis.  We should move to have a truth and reconciliation commission after that report appears and should not wipe this history under the carpet.  It is too much a part of us to be ignored - a sad and dark part of us.</p></speech>

Although I agree broadly with our response and our amendment to it, what is glaringly obvious to me and, I assume, to every other Member of the House, is the omission of an apology.  I acknowledge the steps the Government has taken since last year's recommendation and I recognise and admire the work being undertaken by Senator Martin McAleese's interdepartmental committee, which was established to clarify the extent of State involvement in the laundries.  We certainly do not call for it to stop.  We want its work speeded up.  However, it is clear to me there is enough evidence of State involvement in the Magdalene laundries for the Government to issue an apology.</p><p><br />  A piece in <i>The Irish Times </i>today really struck me:<blockquote>No apology, no pension, no lost wages, no redress and no acknowledgment that what had happened to them was wrong.  A population of Irish women, aging and elderly, living at home and abroad, many vulnerable and marginalised, are all left waiting as time slips by.</blockquote>It is an indisputable fact that three years after the Justice for Magdalenes group circulated an apology and proposed a redress scheme for survivors of the laundries, 22 months after the Irish Human Rights Commission called for a statutory inquiry into the alleged abuses and the provision of redress in appropriate cases, and 15 months after the UN Committee against Torture obliged the State to ensure that within one year survivors would obtain redress, the women at the centre of this debate find themselves in exactly the same position as they were when it started.</p><p><br />  This week every Deputy and Senator in the Oireachtas received a redacted copy of the Justice for Magdalenes' recent principal submission to the interdepartmental committee investigating the State's involvement with the laundries.  This involvement documents overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of State complicity in the abuses experienced by young girls and women in these institutions.  I hope the pending final report on the issue by the interdepartmental committee will offer an even more complete picture of the involvement of this State.</p><p><br />  In the testimonies gathered, survivors have testified they could not leave the laundries, that doors were locked and windows inaccessible.  If they did try to leave they were returned by gardaÃ­.  Others decided not to try to escape because they knew the same fate awaited them.  They could not complain and, in most cases, they remarked there was no one to whom they could complain in any case.  Others begged to leave, often daily, but were always refused.  Every survivor has confirmed they were never paid, that no inspections were ever carried out and that no Government official ever came to check on them.  These women have been let down all their lives and I sincerely hope they will not be let down again.  I urge that the report of the interdepartmental committee be published with all haste and that we issue the strongest and most sincere apology that can be offered on behalf of the State to these women.</p></speech>

I also welcomed the assurance of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to the Justice for Magdalenes' campaign that the development of a narrative of State interaction with the Magdalene laundries would consider acts of omission on the part of the State, in particular the State's failure to inspect and regulate and thereby prevent abuse in the laundries.</p><p>  The committee produced an interim progress report within three months of its establishment in October 2011.  Along with a number of committee meetings, there were meetings with the religious congregations who ran the institutions, relevant academics, and representative groups of the women who resided in the laundries.  The committee reported that extensive searches of all State records had commenced, with results being reported regularly.  Relevant Departments and State offices not represented on the committee have also been contacted with a view to checks being conducted on their records.</p><p>  The report acknowledged the difficulty in identifying and tracing records going back over 90 years.  The committee acknowledged the co-operation of the religious orders which have given them their full assistance and coÂ­operation.  It also acknowledged the constructive engagement with the relevant advocacy and representatives groups.  The committee met Justice for Magdalenes, the Irish Women Survivors Support Network in the UK, and the Magdalene Survivors Group.</p><p>  The committee pointed out the complexity of its task, which required the tracing and examination of a large volume of records across a wide range of sources and covering a period of some 90 years.  Although Senator McAleese had hoped to conclude the work of the committee by mid-2012 he also stated this date might have to be adjusted, depending on the volume of records uncovered and the availability of resources.</p><p>  A significant level of information and documentation has already been identified by the committee and I understand the drafting of the final report has begun.  However, relevant records continue to be identified and the committee continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups.  Senator McAleese has advised that the committee intends to produce its final report as soon as possible, at the latest before the end of the year.  He has explained that information is still being identified which has the capacity to add to the overall outcome of the committee's work in a meaningful way and stated that the committee believes it would be improper to conclude without examining the additional material.  The State, the Government and individual Deputies like me must remember that the issue of the Magdalene laundries is fundamentally about the women who spent time in the institutions.  It is also about their children.  Many of the survivors are now are elderly.  Some women believe - with very good reason - that both church and State have pursued a policy of denial until admission became absolutely necessary.</p><p>  All the indications are that the report of the interdepartmental committee will put us in a position to have a meaningful debate on the issues raised by the different groups representing those who have been in Magdalene laundries.  I agree fully with the view of Government that to pre-empt the report of the committee by making decisions or assertions of fact is not the correct course of action to take.  We have been told we will have the report as soon as possible, certainly before the end of this year which at this stage is only a matter of months away.  The only reasonable course of action is to await that report.</p></speech>

It is almost incomprehensible to my generation and to younger generations that such institutions were allowed to exist.  Moreover, the laundry system was supported by the State through commercial contracts and, outrageously, through society's abandonment of vulnerable citizens for the most dubious of moral reasons.</p><p>  Reading through the testimony of the experiences of the survivors which has been compiled by the Justice for Magdalenes support group one cannot but be ashamed of this stark aspect of our collective past.  Trapped, abandoned, locked away and subjected to horrific abuse the women incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries were modern day slaves stripped of inherent rights and deprived of dignity.</p><p>  The 1911 census of the Mercy laundry in Galway shows women of all ages, all Roman Catholic and from nearly every county in the country.  Their home, such as it was, was Galway but not by choice.  In 2009 in Galway, a sculpture was dedicated to the women who endured the Mercy laundry.  The statue is of a woman in institutional drab clothes holding the sheet aloft to symbolise her enforced endless hours of work - a simple but provocative image.</p><p>  The effects on those houses of mercy are still felt today.  Testimony in the report from one Galway survivor states that she still suffers nightmares 50 years on.  Another eye witness states that a nun used a strap to beat a woman who was depressed and could not work until she was hysterical.  There are many examples of emotional and physical abuse, seclusion and humiliation of women.</p><p>  The excellent work carried out by Justice for Magdalenes not only catalogues these experiences and their aftermath but also sets out a historical account of the laundries and notes how a frenzied public morality combined with a dominant religious force and an indifferent Government transformed 19th century refuges into 20th century prisons and labour camps.  Furthermore, despite the assertions of a previous Government, the Justice for Magdalenes report demonstrates that the laundries were used by the courts as a place of so-called rehabilitation.  </p><p>  The detrimental effects blighted the lives of the women affected long after they had left these institutions.  Health problems, both physical and mental, relationship difficulties and marriage breakdowns, as well as strained relations with families and friends, arose out of this despicable system.  What is even more appalling is that some women were condemned to live out their entire lives in these institutions.</p><p>  As a society, we must face the reality that the abuse that occurred in the Magdalene laundries was in the public domain just as the clerical abuse catalogued by the Murphy and Ryan reports was known to be happening.  </p><p>  The religious orders cannot be let off the hook in terms of providing financial support for their part in this abuse.  This Government initiated the process when it established the interdepartmental committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese.  Regrettably, the conclusion of the committee's work has been delayed, which is perhaps inevitable as its work includes a large number of stakeholders as well as the identification and tracking of documents and records over several decades, but I am confident the committee will provide a comprehensive account of the State's involvement in the Magdalene laundries scandal and promote further debate from which restorative action will emerge.  The survivors and their families are entitled to closure on their long campaign for justice and I hope this is forthcoming very soon.</p></speech>

It was a period, from the foundation of the State, where our children conceived out of wedlock were not welcome in our society and their mothers were considered to be lesser citizens than everyone else, including the father of the child.  It was a time when it was deemed acceptable to deprive those women, many of whom were only girls, not only of their children but also of their freedom, forcing them into a life of unpaid labour and imprisonment.</p><p><br />  Thankfully, though deeply saddening, the treatment of those families is by now well documented.  The harsh reality for them has been articulated by many, including Justice for Magdalenes, and has been accepted by the Irish Human Rights Commission, the United Nations Committee against Torture, and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon that the State's failure to monitor conditions in the laundries amounted to grave and systemic violations of the human rights of all girls and women as protected by the Irish Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, international labour organisation conventions, and UN human rights conventions.</p><p><br />  Why was that the case?  Why did our State abdicate its responsibilities to its female citizens and children and hand them over to the religious orders?  Such was the neglect of its responsibilities that there was no inquiry, inspection or regulation.  For what crime were women incarcerated and punished?  Some became pregnant.  Many of them were victims of rape.<i></i>Others were incarcerated for petty crimes and for no reason other than they were orphans yet our State did nothing.</p><p><br />  It is ironic that what we now call Magdalene laundries were referred to as homes, asylums or refuges.  In the definitions of those words nothing could have been further from the truth.  Some of those in control of the laundries appear to have been Christians in name only.</p><p><br />  It is over ten years, February 2002, since the then Government acknowledged that abuse occurred in the Magdalene laundries.  I want to acknowledge and appreciate the testimony of the survivors and others who came forward with their evidence.  In the past our society put little value on people speaking out, especially where the Church and State were concerned, and I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for them not only to speak out but, in doing so, to relive a time in their lives which was unimaginably traumatic and disturbing, leaving them with lifelong emotional and physical damage.</p><p><br />  Almost two years ago, and a full eight years after the acknowledgement that abuse occurred in the Magdalene laundries, the Irish Human Rights Commission published a document entitled Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the Magdalen Laundries.  This document included the recommendation that any investigation &quot;should first examine the extent of the State's involvement in and responsibility for the girls and women entering the laundries; the condition of the laundries; the manner in which girls and women left the laundries and end of life issues for those who remained&quot;.</p><p><br />  I welcome that on taking office last year this Government established the interdepartmental committee to establish the facts of the State involvement with the Magdalene laundries as a matter of public interest.  In July last year, I was delighted when Senator Martin McAleese was formally appointed by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as the independent chair of the committee.  In establishing it, Senator McAleese requested that senior officials representing all the relevant Departments would sit on the committee, and within one week of his appointment the committee met.</p><p><br />  I welcome also the approach taken by Senator McAIeese and his committee to work positively and sensitively with all who have information of interest and assistance.  </p><p><br />  Considerable work has been completed so far by the committee in a spirit of openness and fairness offering complete confidentiality to those who volunteer to provide information and access to files and documents.  It is important that the committee be allowed to continue its work to establish the facts in examining how the four religious orders operated the laundries.</p><p><br />  I welcome the facilitation of the committee to encourage submissions from advocacy groups, individuals or representative groups to provide information, which may not have been already recorded, and also all the other information sought from State agencies including the Health Service Executive, the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the National Library of Ireland to mention a few.  Crucially, the committee has had meetings with representatives of Justice for Magdalenes, the Irish Women Survivor Support Network and Magdalene survivors.</p><p><br />  There is an enormous amount of information to be examined and, I suspect, more than we thought initially.  While I sincerely acknowledge the anxiety of all of those women, now elderly, and their families to see the conclusion of the work of the committee, I am optimistic that the committee can stay on its own schedule to conclude its work by the end of this year.</p><p><br />  I realise it is not in the terms of reference of this committee to make an apology to these deserving women and their families but the very least they deserve when all the facts are established is an apology, redress and restorative justice.</p></speech>

I am obliged to wonder about how we, as a society, have let these people down.</p><p> The Magdalene laundries are a great stain on the history of Ireland in the 20th century.  By voting in favour of the motion, Members have the opportunity to ensure that these laundries will not also become a stain on Ireland in the 21st century.  The purpose of the motion is to acknowledge the suffering the State participated in bringing about.  It also calls on the State to acknowledge the need for immediate and meaningful discussions on the need for both an apology and redress.  This State's treatment of women during the 20th century can only be described as appalling.  The Magdalene laundries are a horrific example of how the State turned a blind eye to the obvious mistreatment and abuse of women that was perpetrated by religious orders.  To this day, however, nothing has been done to address the plight of those to whom I refer.  Thanks to good investigative journalism, the vast majority of people living in this country now know of the terrible deeds that were done and the justice that was inflicted on these women but the State has failed to issue a quick and comprehensive acknowledgement of their needs.</p><p> Since assuming office, Labour and Fine Gael have not dealt comprehensively with the outcome of the previous Government's refusal to include the Magdalene women in the residential institutions redress scheme or to provide a separate redress mechanism or an apology.  This is not good enough.  Many of the women who were detained in the laundries are aging and time is of the essence in the context of bringing about a resolution.  Many of the women in question are also unwell and this is partly, if not wholly, due to the time they spent incarcerated in the laundries.  To add insult to injury, they cannot gain access to the pensions to which they are entitled after engaging in so many years of gruelling labour for the religious orders.  This is because those orders did not pay the women for their work and nor did they file normal annual employer returns to Revenue.  The latter was despite the fact that they ran the laundries as commercial enterprises.</p><p> In order for justice to be done, the Government must act now rather than allowing matters to continue to drift.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, in an assessment report compiled in 2010, found that women who were locked up in Magdalene laundries suffered serious abuses of their human rights.  The commission called on the Government to immediately establish a statutory inquiry into their treatment and to provide redress to the survivors, as appropriate.  It was supported in this regard by the UN Committee against Torture, which recommended that the State should institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations and, in appropriate cases, bring prosecutions, in addition to affording redress, compensation and rehabilitation to former residents of the Magdalene laundries.  There can be no doubt that what these women suffered in those laundries was nothing short of torture.</p><p> The Government cannot shy away from the responsibility is has to these women on behalf of Irish society.  The purpose of the motion is to challenge the Government to take the immediate measures necessary to support the women on the basis of the extensive information that is already in the public domain.  It is essential that the Government should take action.  Every backbencher should support the motion because justice delayed is justice denied.  We should not deny these women justice any longer.</p></speech>

I applaud them for maintaining their dignity and I compliment them on the way they managed their campaign to seek justice.  They have been an inspiration to people throughout Ireland in the context of how they have conducted themselves.</p><p>  The abuse that took place in the residential institutions is a dark stain on our country's history.  There are many lessons to be learned from what occurred, one of which is that no organisation, body or entity should have absolute power - as was the case with the Catholic Church and the State - over people's lives.  This must never happen again and we must ensure that there will always be oversight, transparency, supervision and accountability.  The women in question were locked up, enslaved and abused mentally, physically and, in some cases, sexually for no other crime than being considered nonconformist or somehow outside the norm.  This was at a time when there was a twisted view of what was women's role in society.</p><p>  It is ironic that we are obliged to engage in this debate, particularly as it comes within seven days of the Government announcing a date for the referendum to guarantee the rights of children.  While I welcome the referendum, I must point out that the Government continues to drag its feet on the granting of justice to those women who were enslaved in the Magdalene laundries.  The motion calls for the Government to commit to an open and meaningful debate on the issue of an apology - Deputy Regina Doherty referred to this fact - redress and restorative justice measures.  How can the Government not support these very simple and just demands?</p><p>  We have been dealing with this issue for many years.  It is ten years since the DÃ¡il formally acknowledged the appalling abuse that took place in the Magdalene laundries.  The women who were incarcerated in those laundries are predominantly aging and elderly.  We cannot wait any longer to obtain justice for them.  Such justice must be seen to be done and not when the Government or anyone else is ready.  Justice should be done in this Chamber tonight.  The women have waited too long and their suffering is only being compounded by the length of time it is taking to obtain justice for them.  It is not for the want of evidence that justice is being denied.  Some 22 months ago the Irish Human Rights Commission issued its report, Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in regard to the Magdalene Laundries, and 15 months ago the United Nations stressed the need for the State to ensure that survivors will obtain redress.  However, the Government's silence regarding this matter has been deafening and its foot-dragging in respect of it is terrible.  In its report, the UN expressed grave concerns about the failure of the State to institute a prompt investigation into allegations relating to the ill-treatment that occurred in the Magdalene laundries.  Even the very congregations which ran the ten laundries have expressed a willingness to bring about clarity, understanding and justice in respect of the women involved.</p><p>  It is shocking that the State colluded in the imprisonment and enslavement of such large number of children and young women in the first instance.  Between 1926 and 1951, some 31,000 were kept in these shadowy, awful institutions.  As recently as 1964, children were being snatched from playgrounds and taken to other institutions in which they were treated in an equally cruel fashion.  Those children were never seen again.  All of this was done with active State support.  This is not a myth because I witnessed one incident of this happening, when the members of a family were snatched from a school playground and taken away.  They were never seen again.</p><p>  The question remains as to why the Government will not support the motion.  Prevarication is cruel, so why will this Administration not allow justice to prevail?  I appeal to those on the Government benches - in the spirit of the forthcoming referendum - to allow the bells of justice to ring out.  The facts are known so they should stop dragging their feet.  They should do the right thing and support both the motion and the women's quest for justice.</p></speech>

By that measure, Irish society has failed shockingly in respect of those who were resident in the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home.  There is little need for me to detail the abuse, neglect, incarceration, systemic oppression, institutionalisation, deprivation in the context of education and forced labour without pay experienced by tens of thousands of Irish women.  This has already been so eloquently done by my comrades.  I must state, however, that I was shocked to read the submission from the Justice for Magdalenes group.  I genuinely felt an enormous sense of disbelief that this type of abuse could have been visited upon vulnerable women.  To my generation, a significant part of the past is a foreign country.  However, it is unbelievable that the Magdalene laundry system remained in place until 1996.  I am equally dumbfounded by the fact that in 2012 Magdalene women have not received justice or even an apology.</p><p>  I am not naive.  In that context, I am aware that in the first half of the previous century Ireland did not have the welfare state safety nets necessary to protect vulnerable people.  I am also aware that in 2012, hundreds of young men and women are allowed to slip - often with tragic consequences - through the cracks in this austerity State's welfare system.</p><p>One would imagine that in a so-called progressive and enlightened society, people would act with haste and urgency to address the grievances, to apologise and to compensate.  Prolonging the injustice and allowing the clock to tick by for women in their 80s who were unjustly left without a pension due to the decisions of this Government, is a disgraceful and inadequate response.</p><p> Our motion does not even go that far.  All we ask is that the material well-being of these women, their ability to provide for themselves and their rights due from their work, are provided for.  It is not the case that the State was oblivious of their existence.  The State paid capitation fees and it paid for laundry services provided.  The State incarcerated citizens within its walls and it captured and returned escapees.  The funding of the Magdalene laundries and part-populating of them could only be done with full knowledge.  Partnership and participation with the system brings responsibility.  If the Government needs to know what is best to do then all it needs to do is remember what its members did when in opposition when they called for redress for these women.</p><p> In 2009, Labour Women made a determination that redress should be forthcoming.  The Irish Human Rights Commission found that serious issues of human rights arose with regard to the treatment of women and girls in the Magdalene laundries.  The UN Committee Against Torture recommended that the State issue prompt redress.  The campaign by Justice for the Magdalenes must be commended.  It has provided a powerful mirror to show us what sort of a society we were.  Unfortunately we cannot change the past but the Government and the Minister can seek to make amends tonight and change the present by accepting this motion.  The shocking facts are that the State used these women and the State failed to protect these women.  The State now has it in its gift to compensate these women.

I think of images of cold, thick walls, bars on windows, the smell of bleach and words such as cruelty, sadness, terror, poverty, unhappiness, regret, hunger, brutality, abuse, despair, beatings, imprisonment and silence.</p><p>  It is now three years since Justice for Magdalenes circulated an apology and redress scheme for survivors.  It is 22 months since the Irish Human Rights Commission stated that a statutory inquiry into alleged abuses and provision of redress should begin immediately.  It is 15 months since the UN Committee Against Torture detailed that the State should ensure that survivors should obtain redress within one year, but the Government continues to delay in providing all Magdalene victims with redress and, more important, with an apology.  The long delay is unacceptable but it is made worse when one considers that survivors of the laundries are elderly and suffering ill health as a result of their forced incarceration and some survivors have been refused pension entitlements by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Tonight as we discuss this motion we must remember also the survivors of another brutal Christian residential institution who were also failed by the State.  The women and children who survived shocking abuse in the Bethany Home are also elderly and they have fought bravely and courageously for an independent inquiry to examine what happened in this residential home, which was open from 1921 to 1972.  Earlier this year, when the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill was debated, I strongly argued that separate redress boards should be created for both the Magdalene laundries women and Bethany Home survivors.  However, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, refused probably because of the financial cost to the State and also because the Bethany Home was a privately owned mother and baby institution.  This does not mean that the State was not complicit; it failed these women and children.</p><p>  Between 1922 and 1949, more than 220 children died in the Bethany Home and 219 were buried in unmarked graves in Mount Jerome cemetery.  I pass their plot very regularly and cannot understand why this Government will not open an inquiry into how our State failed these defenceless children.  That place is a bleak spot with no flowers or markers, no large headstone nor any evidence of the babies and children who passed so quickly through this life.  There are no daisies nor anything else there; it is just a patch of ground.  I attended the cemetery plot recently in the company of some survivors and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  I made the point that we have compounded the hurt of these survivors by not including them in redress.</p><p>  I am reminded of what the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said when in opposition.  At that time she called on the Government to, &quot;do the decent thing and end this outrage.&quot;  These sentiments were supported by her now Cabinet colleagues.  Now these same Members are in a position to do in their own words, &quot;the decent thing&quot;, but they are sitting on their hands and refusing to honour their promises to the elderly survivors of this institution.</p><p>  The list of horrendous abuse in the Bethany Home is long and disturbing, yet we must not shy away from this black episode in the State's history.  In October 1939, following an inspection of the Bethany Home it was found that 14 infants had died since the last inspection of the premises and a total of 57 children were living in the home at the time.  In the same year, a report from an inspector in Monaghan on children who were boarded out from the Bethany Home found that the children were insufficiently clad, unwashed for weeks and that one sick and neglected child had not had a nappy changed for weeks.  Yet the State refused to act.  It suppressed the truth and simply ordered the home to stop admitting Catholics.  There is evidence that one child died there every three weeks between 1935 and 1940.  I ask if we can now do the decent thing but I have not heard any answers from the benches opposite.  We need to do the decent thing and step up to the plate for these women.  Certainly tonight we need to apologise on behalf of the State and we need to bring redress to these elderly people who suffered in these homes.</p></speech>

I am very grateful to have the opportunity to discuss this incredibly important issue and to speak on behalf of a group of very brave and strong people, those who survived what I have little doubt is the worst injustice ever visited on Irish people by other Irish people.  The story of the Magdalene laundries is a kind of horrific catalogue of grinding injustice and every new piece of information still shocks us, despite all that has been uncovered to date.  There is no ability to turn away.</p><p>  As legislators and so-called leaders, we will be nothing but failures, no matter what we achieve otherwise, if we do not do all we can to bring a just and honest close to this most shameful and sad chapter in Irish life.  This is a chapter in which only those who suffered at the hands of the laundries can really be called innocent.  The description of &quot;laundry&quot; or &quot;institution&quot;, should possibly be banned from use in the discussion these places.  We should call them what they were, prisons.  They were not prisons for criminals but for innocent women and children.</p><p>Moreover, their only crime was their gender, for which they were subjected to the hatred, fear and disrespect of both church and State.  It would be convenient for us to shift the blame entirely onto the church and the religious orders which ran the laundries.  The bottom line, however, is that the State which funded these institutions, directly and indirectly, must also bear the guilt.  Silence, apathy and collaboration are not the deeds of the innocent.  The reality is that the State allowed the Catholic Church free rein for many years.  While there were decent and genuine people among the clergy, it is an undeniable fact that the church in this country was riddled with individuals who lacked the most basic humanity and saw fit to treat women and children, in particular, as nothing more than property - useful in their way but ultimately deserving of hatred, violence and abuse.</p><p> Despite being designated as factories where clothes were washed for external use, the State failed utterly in its obligations to inspect the laundries.  The Factories Act 1955 stipulated that all operations covered by the Act were required to follow health and safety regulations and abide by employment law, as well as being subject to State inspection to ensure conditions were in order.  None of these requirements was upheld because the Magdalene prisons were above the law.  None of the ten laundries operating in the State was inspected, despite very high inspection rates for other factories.  It is difficult to accept that there was no concerted decision not to inspect the laundries knowing, as we do, what would have been found and the trouble it would have caused.  In response to a recent parliamentary question as to why the institutions had not been inspected, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, offered the quip that entitlement and requirement were not the same.  That is not good enough.</p><p> What will the Government do for the people who suffered at the hands of the State in this manner?  In 2010 a former Minister for Education and then Deputy, Michael Woods, tipped his hat to the victims in the debate on the establishment of the residential institutions redress scheme but offered nothing by way of a genuine response to their just campaign for redress.  That campaign for justice continues today.  A committee has been set up to establish the extent of State involvement, by now a well established fact.  I wish the committee well in its work, but it will not offer any resolution.  The bottom line is that the State failed utterly in its duty of care to these women and girls.  Even worse, it co-operated in their prosecution.  These citizens were kidnapped, abused, beaten and enslaved and told it was just punishment for their wrongdoing.</p><p> I take the opportunity to mention the victims and survivors of Bethany Home.  Between 1922 and 1949, more than 220 children died in the care of that institution, 219 of whom were buried in unmarked graves in Mount Jerome cemetery.  Although often forgotten, they are equally deserving of justice.  Bethany Home was essentially the Magdalene laundry for Protestant women.  Its survivors are entitled to justice and truth and must also receive a State apology and redress.</p><p> Throughout the world people remember and memorialise victims of injustice.  Monuments are built and plaques and statues erected in order to ensure they are never forgotten and to remind subsequent generations that the crimes visited on the people concerned must never be allowed to recur.  The time for prevarication is past.  The State must apologise to the victims of the Magdalene laundries and state unequivocally that what happened will never happen again.  The nation must act with a humanity and care towards the victims that will make the horrors of the laundries seem even worse by comparison.  We must give immediate redress and support to the survivors of these crimes.  TÃ¡imid ag lorg tacaÃ­ocht an TÃ­ le haghaidh an rÃºn seo ar GhnÃ³ ComhaltaÃ­ PrÃ­obhÃ¡ideacha.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#FFF00200"><p>One of the key issues to be addressed in regard to the Magdalene laundries is the role of the State, which encompasses not only its abdication of responsibility but also its role in covering up the mistreatment and injustice meted out to victims.  All aspects of the State's role are set out in a comprehensive report prepared for the interdepartmental Oireachtas committee established to investigate the matter by the Justice for Magdalenes group.  Among the disgraceful facts to emerge from that report is the revelation that Departments and public companies utilised the services of the laundries.  In fact, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in gave its custom to one of the institutions.  It is startling to see that the report documents transactions from as recently as 1980 and 1981.</p><p>  In its commercial dealing with the laundries the State was effectively utilising the services of indentured servants.  In fact, one might use even stronger words to describe the status of the women and girls who worked there.  There was also the wider issue of the State's failure to monitor what was going on in the laundries.  As in the case of the industrial schools administered by religious orders, this amounted to an effective privatisation of punishment.  Moreover, the women sent to the Magdalene laundries and placed under the charge of the nuns who ran them were not guilty of any crime under the law but merely of an offence against perceived social acceptability.</p><p>  The Irish Human Rights Commission has accepted that the failure on the part of the State to supervise the operation of the laundries amounted to a grave and systematic violation of the victims' rights as provided for under the Constitution.  The conditions under which they were made to work violated the European Convention on Human Rights, various United Nations conventions on human rights and the conventions laid down for conditions of employment by the International Labour Organisation.  The manner in which these young women were admitted into and detained in custody also violated the provision in Article 40.4.1o of the Constitution that no citizen &quot;shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law&quot;.  It is not inconceivable that had a case been taken on this basis, the reference to &quot;his&quot; might have been used as an excuse for what amounted to the illegal incarceration as workers without rights of the Magdalene women.</p><p>  In this context, it is remarkable that during the entire period of their operation, only one laundry - at Sean McDermott Street, which was designated under the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as a remand centre - was legally entitled to detain any person.  The treatment endured by the inmates violated international prohibitions on forced labour and degrading treatment, even though the State had ratified the 1930 convention which prohibited the use of &quot;forced or compulsory labour&quot;.  Even apart from these larger human rights issues, the laundries were in clear violation of domestic law.  For example, the provisions of the Factories Acts could and should have been applied and the institutions subjected to regular inspections.  If they had been carried out honestly, such inspections would have found the laundries to be in clear violation of the legislation.</p><p>  What makes the enforced slavery of the women concerned even worse is the fact that the laundries, far from being the charitable institutions they claimed to be, were, in reality, highly profitable businesses.  The Justice for Magdalenes report includes the claim by a former manager of the Magdalene laundry in Limerick that it had made a profit of some IRÂ£100,000 in 1976.  Not only was this a huge sum of money in those days, it would not be considered a poor return by a local laundry today.  This huge profit margin was made possible because the laundry workers were unpaid and without rights.  One can conclude that in the course of their operation the Magdalene laundries must have made several millions in profits.  In combination with the huge sums accrued by the religious orders in land deals, this makes it a moral imperative that survivors are duly compensated for their labour and loss of freedom and the degradation forced on many of them.  Anything less would be an insult to their suffering.</p><p>  Under the alleged care of these terrible institutions, young women were deprived of their civil rights and used as slaves for the profit and benefit of those who ran them.  Another speaker referred last night to an unfortunate young woman who escaped from one of the laundries only to be brought back and brutalised.  A relative of mine who tried to escape from an institution was likewise subjected to brutal treatment.  There is only one acceptable outcome to all of this, namely, a public apology from the State for what was done to the women concerned.</p><p>Compensation must be paid to those who had to endure the loss of their freedom and the injustice of being used as slaves by the State and religious orders.  Nothing else will suffice.</p></speech>

I have listened carefully and with great interest to what was said and the broad range of views expressed.  In particular, I thank Deputy McDonald for her contribution and for rightly affording all of us an opportunity to ensure this issue remains to the fore in our minds.  I have great sympathy for the women involved and it is fair to conclude from the contributions to the debate that the House is in broad agreement on this issue.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated last night, the story of the Magdalene women is one that has been told with a great deal of dignity and they deserve our respect.  No one who has met the women or listened to their stories can be anything but impressed by the eloquence of their testimonies.  I agree with much of what has been said in that regard.</p><p>  I assure the House again that the Government has listened carefully to the women and the various groups advocating on their behalf.  It is committed to addressing the issues and, unlike its predecessors, took action to put in place a process for doing so.  Almost immediately on taking office, we established such a process when we appointed an interdepartmental committee under the independent chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese.  I assure the House that we will see this process through and are fully committed to addressing these issues once the final report has been received.  The Government has been conscious at all times of the need to progress these matters as quickly as possible.</p><p>  As the Minister of State explained last night, the main point behind the amendment is that it is premature to have this debate without having the benefit of Senator McAleese's report and the factual information it will bring.  The report, which is being finalised, will help to establish the facts of State involvement, give us a better understanding of what took place and provide for the proper and meaningful response to which the Government is committed.</p><p>  Deputies will be aware that Senator McAleese was appointed to the chairmanship of the interdepartmental committee to ensure full confidence in its workings and preclude any legitimate issue arising with regard to the committee properly fulfilling its mandate.  They will also be aware and appreciate that Senator McAleese has been steadfast and absolute in his commitment to fulfilling that mandate.  Under his astute chairmanship, the committee is receiving the full and voluntary co-operation of everyone involved, including Government Departments, agencies, representative and advocacy groups and academics.  I also understand the Senator has met with many women who came forward to the committee both here and in England.  These women are being listened to and their stories will be told.</p><p>  Within three months of its establishment, the interdepartmental committee produced an interim report, as requested, and this report has been published.  The question of additional resources for the committee was also raised.  I understand, however, that it is satisfied that it has available to it the resources needed to complete its task and that the allocation of further resources is not required and would not speed up its work.  I also understand Senator McAleese has indicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality that he expects to be in a position to submit a substantial final report in a matter of months and certainly before the end of the year.</p><p>  While drafting of the final report has begun, I believe relevant records continue to be identified and the interdepartmental committee continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups, one of which was received as late as 15 August 2012.  Before we rush to make judgments, it makes sense to allow time for the committee to consider all the material that has been placed before it.</p><p>  As the Minister of State noted last night, all the indications are that the report of the interdepartmental committee will enable us to have a meaningful debate on the issues raised by the different groups representing those who have been in Magdalene laundries and provide a proper response.  Both the motion and amendment welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental committee, while the latter commits to an open and meaningful response to all the issues once the committee has reported.</p><p>  As I stated, the Government is conscious of the need to progress matters as quickly as possible.  The only difference between us and the Deputies opposite is that we will not pre-empt the report of the committee by making decisions or assertions of fact.  When we have the report, which will be before the end of the year, we will all be better informed and in a position to provide for a proper response based on the findings produced.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p></speech>

It is a matter of urgency that the matter before us is addressed.  We are simply seeking to have an acknowledgement from all Members of the House that supports must be put in place urgently for the aging survivors of the Magdalene laundries.  Thereafter, we must have an open and meaningful debate on the issues of an apology, redress and restorative justice.</p><p>  We will never know the full story of the injustices, suffering and sheer torment experienced by the women and girls incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries.  This injustice was exacerbated and compounded by their exclusion from the residential institutions redress scheme. The Magdalene laundries and Bethany homes are another dark chapter in the litany of abuses perpetuated on the women of Ireland by the churches with State complicity, yet no apology has been forthcoming from the State for the terror inflicted on the women in question.  It is astonishing that not one representative of the Government Departments and statutory bodies which had a hand in ensuring the involuntary servitude of women has ever felt the need to apologise.  The State was complicit in the Magdalene laundries and questions remain about the role of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, which returned Magdalene runaways to the laundries by the hair on their heads.  Notwithstanding this, the Government sees fit to inform the House that an interdepartmental committee is examining the issue.</p><p>  I am not a spokesperson for the Magdalene women but someone who believes in justice.  I am also an elected representative who has a role in holding the Government to account.  The Government's approach is not good enough.  Having spent years and in some cases decades in incarceration, slaving, cleaning and toiling to keep religious orders as profitable industries, the Magdalene survivors are spending the rest of their lives shamed and stigmatised by a State that did not care.  Many of them are elderly and suffering ill health as a result of the treatment they experienced.  There are at least 30,000 Magdalene survivors.</p><p>  It is a tragedy of epic proportions that no member of the religious orders and no representative of the State has been held to account for the torture inflicted on what were described as &quot;fallen women&quot;.  Even today, questions need to be asked about the religious orders and their motivations.  Two of the religious congregations which ran the Magdalene laundries, the Good Shepherd Sisters and Sisters of Our Lady of Charity, receive funding from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health to work with women involved in prostitution, while other organisations which promote women's rights have had their funding slashed.  One could be forgiven for asking if it is still the official view of the State that there are fallen women out there.  Both of the religious congregations to which I referred have refused to meet the Justice for Magdalenes group, yet we are expected to believe it is appropriate that they are entrusted with caring for and advocating on behalf of vulnerable women.</p><p>  It is interesting that the State was run for decades on the basis of a Constitution framed around God and Christian values.  The way in which the Magdalene institutions were run, ignored by the apparatus of the State, could not be further from the teachings of Christ.  The Magdalene laundries were evil.  What we had in this State were anti-Christian institutions posturing as Christians.  Not only did they turn a blind eye to the disgusting enslavement of women and children, they also preached moral values to others, upheld conservative, right-wing establishment politics, and told people to keep their heads down and not question educated professionals.</p><p>The answer they have for our people is so profound but they could not have been further away from the teachings of Christ.  Each and every one of them should be ashamed of themselves.  The institutions which covered this up and utilised religion and Christ's teachings to enslave and hold our people down should be ashamed of themselves too.  I have had the honour of knowing genuine Christians who served overseas on the missions and defended oppressed people.  They too were let down and failed by their hierarchy.  This is the great shame of an institution which used the teachings of Christ to oppress their people and support institutions of government to do likewise.  Shame on anyone who was involved in that and calls themselves a Christian.</p><p> Those of us who actually have a faith in Christ need to have these conversations.  We are ashamed of those institutions which used Christ's name to uphold disgusting acts, to defend right-wing, conservative politics and to oppress our people for decades.  It is high time this issue was resolved with the obfuscation and stalling ended.  We know what happened in the Magdalene laundries was slavery and is a black stain on our people's conscience.  The Government must do the right thing and put in place the procedures for justice.  We can then wait for the report of Senator McAleese, in whom we all have great faith.</p></speech>

While I can only imagine the nightmare, I know there are many who live with the reality.  I am also conscious as we debate this motion that there are women and their families watching this debate for whom the Magdalene laundries is not a horror story but an actual horror that visited itself upon them directly, a horror with ongoing consequences.</p><p>  I find it unacceptable the Minister suggests the motion put down by Sinn FÃ©in is premature.  These sites of horror operated with the connivance and under the nose of the State from 1922 until 1996.  Let no one pretend we did not know.  We knew but we chose to look away.  The motion tabled by Sinn FÃ©in, with the support of our Independent colleagues and Fianna FÃ¡il, relies entirely on facts established and aired in the public arena.  There is no conjecture in it.  It is a fact that committal to and residence in the laundries was not voluntary.  It is a fact the State interacted actively with the laundries.  It is a fact these laundries, although private institutions, enjoyed considerable financial State support while women and girls were enslaved to work without pay.  It is a fact the State deliberately failed to inspect these laundries.  The trauma and the stigma endured by detainees which lives with them to this day is also a fact.  These are women who are aged and many of whom are ill.</p><p>  While few Members have sought to dispute these facts, I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, did so last evening.  In defending the Government's position, she cited the McAleese committee as the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, just did.  She said the committee would produce what she called the first comprehensive and objective insight into the laundries.  The Minister deliberately misrepresented the committee's remit.  It is tasked with establishing the extent of State involvement in these laundries, not the fact.  The Minister spoke as if there were no established facts, no survivors' testimonies, or no documented evidence of abuse or State interaction.  Shame on her.</p><p>  There was worse to come.  She also stated, &quot;As far as I am aware, allegations of abuse in Magdalene laundries have never been the subject of scrutiny by the courts, a commission of investigation or tribunal of inquiry, so the facts remain undetermined.&quot;  The hand-wringing Minister cast a doubt over the validity of survivors' testimonies because the women did not go to court.  She knows right well why there were no court cases.  She is fully aware of the reasons women who were brutalised, stigmatised and fearful did not go to the courts.  She is more than aware why cases could not now be taken because the Statute of Limitations prevents a survivor, even if she were so minded, from going to the courts now.  The Minister knew all of this but came into the Chamber last evening to deliver the Government's line without skipping a beat.  With all due respect to the Minister of State across the floor now, Deputy McGinley, he did the same this evening.  He claimed the women have been listened to.  Have they?  Has the story really been listened to?</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, advised us not to leap to conclusions.  I want to draw some conclusions about the behaviour of the State and the Government in this matter.  In May 2011 the Government, represented by the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, appeared before the UN committee against torture.  Its approach was disgraceful, defensive and stonewalling while its submission was misleading or, at the very least, incomplete.  The State claimed the laundries were private institutions, voluntarily occupied and outside the remit of State responsibility, bar one exception.  The Government was giving purchase to a lie that tried to convince us that nothing was known about the enslavement and brutality visited on women in these institutions.  That impression was a lie then and is a lie now.</p><p>  The Government tells us it does not want to pre-empt the McAleese committee.  The motion does not ask it to do that.  Instead, it recognises and welcomes the work of Senator McAleese but states clearly justice for the women does not need to be put on hold.  In fact, the motion insists justice for the women cannot and will not be put on hold.  The McAleese committee can proceed with its work but it does not stop the State from acknowledging the survivors, apologising to them and making arrangements for the basic support services they need now.</p><p>  Those on the Government backbenches will probably choose the path of least resistance and follow their Whips to vote against this motion.  That is their prerogative.  However, in making that choice, they will be co-opted into the defensive denial mode of the Government.</p><p>In making that choice they will allow this debate to draw to a conclusion with no Government acknowledgement of the damage done to the women or of the failures of the State.  They will leave these women yet again with no apology, no commitment to pension rights, no redress or the small comfort of knowing that this DÃ¡il will ensure the provision of supports needed by these women here and now.</p><p> Kicking the can down the road is an expression often used to describe political manoeuvres and delay.  Deploying this tactic on the Magdalene survivors is unworthy of this DÃ¡il and its Members.  I call on the Government to withdraw its amendment and support the original motion.  If my plea falls on deaf ears, know this: by sheer force of numbers the Government side has succeeded only in doing the wrong thing.</p><p> I commend the survivors of the Magdalene laundries.  Their stories are on the record.  We hear them and we believe them.  We cannot give them back their childhood, youth or their lives but we can say that they are due a full apology, redress, pension rights and a full affirmation of their innocence and their good name.  I put it to the survivors and to those on the Government benches that we will not rest until the justice that these women deserve is delivered.  The Government should do the right thing, set aside its stonewalling amendment and support this motion.  It is the least these women should expect from their elected parliamentarians.</p></speech>

However, I wonder whether the Government is as committed to that, particularly considering that in the past week we had the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  The proposal in that regard was to defer revetting because of the lack of resources.  This is a worrying trend and I hope it is something that will not continue when the children's referendum is passed.</p><p>  Funding needs to be made available in the immediate aftermath of the referendum for the Judiciary and for the Judicial Studies Institute to ensure the Judiciary is fully up to speed on what is intended and what we want to see happen with regard to the courts' interpretations of the amendment so as to ensure children's rights are vindicated as we want them to be.  It is also vital that the child and family support agency is fully and properly funded.  We must ensure this happens.  Placing children's rights in the Constitution is only half the battle.  We must ensure funding is there to ensure agencies can work to vindicate the rights of children.</p><p>  In conclusion, as the Minister pointed out, we have failed miserably in the past.  When we look at the legacy of child abuse, the children affected by the Magdalene laundries and at what went on in the Bethany homes, we see a record of failure.  This amendment shows that can and will change.  However, the amendment is only the halfway stage and we must ensure the legislation and resources are put in place to sure it is enacted properly.  The amendment is a good start and it shows we have some commitment to children.  We need to demonstrate we are fully committed to making it work for all the children in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#LLL00600"><p>I welcome the proposed thirty-first amendment of the Constitution which expressly recognises children in their own right within the Constitution and enshrines and gives firmer recognition to their protection.  It is important that the Oireachtas, in its deliberations, gets the strongest and most robust formula and wording possible in the Bill.  The wording must be based on clarity and facts in order to ensure the public fully understands it is first and foremost about children and that it affirms at all stages the protection and empowerment of these children, who are in many cases incapable of speaking for themselves.</p><p><br />  I will refer to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister last January asking about her plans to address the significant increase in calls to the Childline helpline on Christmas Day and asking her to make a statement on the matter.  Her response was as follows:<blockquote>  Childline is a confidential listening service for children and young people operated by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC.  The service is available by telephone, online and mobile texting and is operated by professionally trained ISPCC staff and volunteers.  The ISPCC reported that Childline received 1,387 calls and messages on Christmas day and that 85 ISPCC volunteers gave freely of their time to listen and support children who needed to talk to someone.</blockquote>The Minister went on to state:<blockquote>  I have no precise information regarding the breakdown of the nature of the calls received by Childline on Christmas day.   It is difficult therefore to make any assessment of the issues raised.  However, I have asked the Health Service Executive, as the body charged with statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection matters and which has an established relationship with the ISPCC, to liaise directly with the ISPCC on this issue with a view to identifying any particular areas of concern arising from the level of contact made with Childline on Christmas day.</blockquote>To be honest, this response is a sad reflection on society.  It exemplifies in micro fashion how on this particular day of festivity some 1,387 children felt they had to pick up the telephone and voice their concerns to the 85 volunteers who, fortunately, were accepting calls.  I compliment the ISPCC on its Childline service and on the work it carries out to protect and support the many vulnerable children it encounters in its role.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned the HSE.  There should be more contact and greater liaison and co-operation between Childline and the HSE to ensure maximum intervention protocols and the necessary monitoring systems are put in place.  I compliment support groups such as Barnardos and the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation which have restricted budgets and rely on voluntary efforts to carry out their vital roles in improving the quality of life of thousands of children.  </p><p> The need for constitutional reform has been accepted for many years.  It was discussed intermittently, if not at length, in the Oireachtas in the early 1980s.  A number of official reports that called for constitutional change to strengthen the rights of children were left on the shelf to gather dust.  The many court cases concerning child welfare in recent years have served to highlight the inadequacy of the current constitutional recognition afforded to the rights of children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has been calling for stringent protection for children's rights in the Constitution since the establishment of that office over eight years ago.  The ombudsman, Ms Emily Logan, first called for an amendment to the Constitution in January 2005 to enhance children's rights.  She has demonstrated since, especially through her officeâs complaints work, that there is an urgent need for childrenâs rights to be enhanced in the Constitution.  Many of the complaints with which she deals highlight a lack of awareness about the impact of civil and public administrative decision-making on the lives and rights of children and their families.  In her submissions to the Oireachtas she has called for a number of key elements to be included in the Constitution.  These include an express statement of the rights of the child, the best interests principle, a State duty to support families while responding in a proportionate manner and a provision to enable the sharing of soft information.  I am glad that many of her recommendations are contained in this proposal.  I hope the democratic exercise on 10 November will endorse the referendum proposal and enshrine key childrenâs rights principles in the Constitution in order to underpin a fundamental shift in our law, practice and policy on children.  </p><p> I congratulate the Minister on the compilation of the Bill.  I wish her well in her efforts to bring it through the Houses and have it endorsed.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on the introduction of such a balanced wording.  I acknowledge the broad support for the amendment proposed in this legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the country generally.  That bodes well for the referendum on 10 November when I hope there will be a positive outcome, as I am sure there will be.</p><p>  I would like to set out the background to the forthcoming referendum.  During the years we were all rightly shocked by the findings of various reports such as the Roscommon, Kilkenny, Ryan and Cloyne reports.  The attitudes that allowed such abuses to continue had to be challenged and overcome.  The Bill which sets out the wording of the amendment to be put to the people in the proposed referendum is an important part of that process.  Obviously, it has to be read alongside other legislation, including the Children First Bill, the vetting Bill and the forthcoming legislation to establish the child and family support agency.</p><p>  The referendum has been a long time coming.  The first recommendations for constitutional reform in this area were made by the task force on child care in the 1980s.  Various committees have produced reports since.  At international level, in 1998 and 2006 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child added its voice to the calls for the constitutional position of children to be strengthened.  A number of High Court and Supreme Court cases have also raised concerns in this area.  There have been many indications that the current constitutional position presents a difficulty when particular cases have to be dealt with.  Thankfully, the Minister has introduced this legislation, which means a referendum will take place on 10 November.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the constitutional amendment will make children more visible and ensure decisions are made in the best interests of children.  It recognises that children have rights and that all children are equal.  It allows the rights of children to be balanced against other competing constitutional rights.  It introduces the best interests principle, to be used as a guide when decisions are being made to resolve disputes in areas such as adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  It also includes the principle of hearing the voice of the child in judicial and administrative proceedings and is active in the area of supporting families and protecting children.  It applies the same standards to all children and places an onus on the State to support families and adopt a proportionate response to parental failure.</p><p>  The language used in the wording of the amendment is balanced.  It refers, in the first instance, to &quot;all children&quot;.  It sets out what the State has to do &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  It makes it clear that these provisions will apply to parents who &quot;regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected&quot;.  It provides that the response of the State must be &quot;proportionate&quot; and in line with &quot;the best interests of the child&quot;.  I do not doubt that a great deal of thought and preparation went into such a balanced wording.</p><p>  The question of adoption is dealt with in the Bill.  At present, it is virtually impossible for a child to be adopted if his or her parents are married.  Approximately 6,000 children are in care, approximately one third of whom have been in long-term care for more than five years.  Many of them have little or no contact with their parents.  If the amendment is passed and the subsequent adoption legislation enacted, children in care will be eligible for adoption.  That will clear the way for the Oireachtas to introduce legislation that will allow any child to be voluntarily placed for adoption, which will be a welcome development also.</p><p>  I would like to refer to the question of resources which has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  It is fine to introduce a constitutional provision of this nature, but we need to ensure the actions of the State correspond to the provision in question.  We need to focus on poverty-proofing future budgets, for example.  Educational services in certain areas are not adequate and, unfortunately, have disimproved in recent years.  Larger class sizes and the lack of special needs assistants are having an impact on vulnerable children.  There are long waiting lists in the health area.  I am contacted on a daily basis by parents who are waiting for ear, nose and throat services for their children.  Urgent cases can now wait for 18 months, while less urgent cases can wait for as long as four years.</p><p>These are areas that need to be addressed and improved by the State.  Approximately 200,000 children in this State live in either consistent or relative poverty, which is an area that also needs to be addressed by the State.  Resources need to be made available to ensure what we have in the Constitution actually corresponds to what we are doing in practice on the ground, particularly for vulnerable children.</p></speech>

The Government has placed children's interests at the top of its priority list since its inception and, for the first time, a senior Cabinet Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was appointed with responsibility for children's affairs.  This is the fourth referendum the Government will have held in 18 months, which proves it is a reforming Government and wants to see real change in Irish society.  I commend the Minister and the Cabinet for bringing this Bill and the amendment to the Constitution to the Oireachtas and to the people in the coming weeks.</p><p>  It is not only this Bill as there is other legislation which will impact on children who might be vulnerable.  There is the vetting legislation which was referred to in the House earlier in the week and which will introduce statutory legislative requirements for those who work with or come in contact with children on a regular basis.  There is also the proposed adoption legislation and, of course, the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, which will have the responsibility for child welfare and protection services, for which the HSE will no longer be responsible.</p><p>  I recognise the Minister's commitment to this area and her track record.  It is no surprise to me because of her dedication, work and commitment that she has managed to bring what has been a complex and difficult issue to the people to decide.  I would also like to commend the joint committee that sat over many meetings and deliberated on the wording of any proposed referendum.  The former parliamentarians of all parties who were involved should be recognised as we pass this legislation through the House.  I believe the cross-party support for the Bill reflects the maturity of this democracy and this Parliament.  However, we need to caution against complacency and ensure the people are fully informed of this debate and the implications it will have for the system of protection for children who might be at risk.  This has been going on for the past 20 years and, at last, we are seeing progress.</p><p>  I am a parent of three small children and believe it is important to acknowledge the many thousands of parents who look after their children, day in, day out and at night as well, because it is not easy to rear children in the current climate.  It has never been easy.  However, parents do what they do best, and they put their best foot forward to rear their children and give them the best chance in society.  We need to publicly acknowledge this but while we do, we also acknowledge there are difficulties in some families and there are children at risk.  This is where the weaknesses have been, although it has taken until now to acknowledge this.  We are finally giving the people of Ireland the opportunity to put that right.  This is an important point in regard to the referendum and the legislation.  It will not only be for children who are citizens of this country but for all children who reside in the country.  They will all be protected under this new legislation and the changes to the Constitution.</p><p>  I am the chairperson of a board of management of a mid-size, 250-pupil primary school in County Waterford.  I am acutely aware of the obligations on boards of management and people in positions of trust given the protection policies and school policies that have to be in place to ensure full protection.  It is only right that in the most important policy statement of all, namely, the Constitution, children's rights are put first and foremost and that the best interests of children are protected.</p><p>  We should also recognise the NGOs and advocacy groups who have always been a voice for children despite the fact the Constitution and the courts may not have heard the important voice of a small child in difficult cases.  I am happy to support a Bill that will give the opportunity for the Irish people to let that child be heard in all proceedings relating to those cases.  I commend the Bill and commend the Minister for her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#NNN00500"><p>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the Chamber and compliment her for the fact she has been present for almost all, if not all, of the debate, which shows her and her Department's seriousness on this issue.  I also acknowledge as a very welcome move the Government's decision to hold the referendum on a Saturday, which is particularly important for first-time voters and those who are away from home.  If the Minister takes anything from my contribution, I would urge the Government to put Saturday polling on a legislative footing.  Going forward, this is something the State should do, at a minimum, to allow people to exercise their franchise.</p><p>  Before I came into the DÃ¡il, I worked as a teacher.  Having listened to more experienced and more seasoned campaigners than myself in the teaching profession, I was struck by the fact experienced teachers could identify with a sense of accuracy when a child presented himself or herself in junior infants how that child was going to progress.  More often than not, they got it right down through the years.</p><p>  This referendum, if it protects one child, will be worth it, given the litany of scandals that have surrounded this whole area since the State was founded.  It definitely has been the pall of shame over Ireland since independence.  Successive Administrations down through the years, for one reason or another, whether for fear of outside institutions and pressure groups or just out of sheer ignorance, decided that the mantra that the child should be seen and not heard was the most important thing.  I want to acknowledge the fact children are being given a constitutional voice in this, the 75th anniversary year of the Constitution, which, by and large, has been a very robust and good document.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, children will be recognised legally as equal citizens with the rest of us.  The Minister and the Government should be complimented for this.</p><p>  Reference was made to the dozens of reports and the 20 year lapse since Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness first enunciated the need for a referendum.  We are forgetting the fact there were children behind all of those reports.  One of the images I constantly have in my mind from the Roscommon report is how the children presented themselves with lice climbing down their faces.  There was a litany of failure from the State, its institutions and people working in this area.  It is one thing to amend the Constitution but another to ensure the structures are put in place to allow the primary teacher, the social worker, the swimming coach or the librarian who might have a concern for a child to, in a very safe and responsible fashion, enunciate that concern.</p><p>  As I and previous speakers have said, it is one thing to amend the Constitution but a totally different thing to roll that all the ensuing provisions out on a day-to-day basis.  This is why the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will make a difference.  For the first time, children are not just shoved under the Department of Health or seen as an add-on to the Department of Education and Skills but are seen as equal citizens in this democracy, with a Minister whose sole responsibility is to them, and them alone.  One of the issues that has become relevant is that the collapse of the family and the cycle of abuse and neglect is not a modern phenomenon but is something that reports in the media have forced on us as legislators, both in this and previous generations.  In fairness, legislators in some cases have been dragged kicking and screaming, as has society, into modernising the institutions that are there to protect children and to ensure children are given the protection of the State they deserve.</p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy referred to the issue of adoption.  As a new Deputy, I was totally unaware of the hurdles that face families.  I have since spoken to the Minister several times in regard to inter-country adoption.</p><p>I was totally ignorant of the fact that over 2,000 children are in long-term foster care, for whatever reason, but their foster parents are unlikely to be able to adopt them under the current regime.  This referendum may give them the chance of a normal family life.</p><p> All of us in this Chamber were probably lucky enough, like myself, to have good parents who brought us up in the best way that they knew, putting their children first always.  This referendum and the legislation we are debating may only affect a small number of children, but if it protects one and if it prevents another Roscommon or prevents another child from having lice running down his face, then it is a good day's work.  I compliment the Minister for bringing this Bill forward.</p></speech>

It reflects badly on us when those denied protection are the most innocent and vulnerable among us and are wholly incapable of protecting themselves.  I am speaking of our most treasured asset, our future, those who will carry the mantle of this nation in the future .</p><p>  The suite of legislation undertaken by this Government, the enactment of which is being expedited by our specifically designated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, is aimed at addressing the protection of children in a real and meaningful way.  The jewel in the crown of the process is the introduction of the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012, which will amend the Constitution and insert a new article, Article 42A, which will have the effect of enshrining the protection of children and expressly recognising them in their own right within the Constitution.</p><p>  In passing this Bill we are galvanizing the protection of children and ensuring the right of every child to be afforded constitutional protection in their own right.  In doing so, we are displaying a maturity and establishing ourselves as a nation where every citizen is truly cherished equally and entitled to enjoy all the rights conferred on us by our Constitution.  We are truly implementing change.  We are no longer paying lip service to the abhorrent revelations that came dripping slowly from a hidden Ireland, where abusers and predators were at best ignored and at worst, protected.  I am not referring to any particular sector of society in saying this, as child abuse spans every socioeconomic, cultural, religious and political boundary and is to be found anywhere the light fails to shine.</p><p>  As a Government we are succeeding where others have failed.  We are ceasing the practice of displaying shock and horror, practised by previous Administrations, at the horror stories and cases bursting on to the media, only to be forgotten about when the next big issue arose.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, elevated the children's portfolio to a Front Bench position as far back as 2007 and was the first to give recognition to the important position children should be afforded in Government.  He followed through on this important process by creating a new Cabinet position of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, which has been eminently filled by my party colleague, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, who deserves great credit for tackling this gaping absence in our legislation and Constitution, whereby children and the most vulnerable among us were denied the protection available to other citizens.</p><p>  The need for this protection has been highlighted by successive reports including the Kilkenny incest case and subsequent investigations, the Constitutional Review Group report of 1996, the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution report of 2006, the Roscommon incest and rape case and the subsequent report of 2010, the report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in 2010, as well as various clerical abuse tribunals.  Almost 20 years have passed, when we had money for everything, without this gaping hole in our society being addressed.  It was not as if there were few incidences of abuse.  Last year alone, of the 30,000 child protection and welfare concerns reported, 1,500 were confirmed cases of sexual, physical or emotional abuse and that does not include the vastly more numerous welfare issues.</p><p>  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and this Government do this nation a great service and deserve the support of this House in forging ahead with these various instruments of legislation, which will finally afford protection to our children who hold the hopes and aspirations of a struggling but proud nation in the palms of their hands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600005#OOO00300"><p>It is entirely appropriate that as the Minister sits here and listens to the debate, she has a copy of the Constitution in front of her.  Perhaps she carries it with her all of the time but it is particularly appropriate that she has it here tonight because, of course, it is the Constitution itself that we are seeking to change.  As we do this, it is appropriate to reflect on where the Constitution came from and the good that it has done the State to date.</p><p>  As we acknowledge the 75th anniversary of this document, which Deputy O'Donovan did earlier, it is very easy to forget what a brave and progressive document it was in the context of where Ireland stood then.  It stood as a small country on the edge of a very fraught and uncertain Europe.  There were many recognitions and systems put into that document that have served our country very well and have stood the test of time.  However, as many other speakers have commented, the one group that was not referenced at all was children.  One factor that distinguishes them is that, unlike other groups that were referenced in that document, children do not have the ability to organise themselves or to come together collectively and articulate what they are looking for in the way that many other groups, that were rightfully enumerated in the document, do.  Children do not choose their parents nor the families into which they arrive.  The environment is something that is a given for them and they have to choose how to respond to it.  With that in mind, it is an omission in the document that has not served our country well and that has had terrible consequences for children over different generations.</p><p>  When we talk about children within the amendment we are putting forward to the country, we are not just talking about children at risk.  We are actually talking about all children.  We are talking about making sure that they, as a group and as individuals, are explicitly recognised within our Constitution and that their rights are clearly called out.  This will have many consequences in the future which, in truth, few of us can foretell.  We do not know how they will develop and crystallise.  That can only be a good thing for the group that has not been recognised to date.</p><p>  The number of children we are talking about, notwithstanding what I have just said, who might be affected by this constitutional amendment in a material way is, thankfully, tiny.  However, these are children to whom we have not given the right protection or support over the years.</p><p>  One aspect of the amendment that I particularly welcome is that the threshold for intervention it sets is high enough to ensure that it will only be called in or triggered in exceptional cases, where children are not just being let down by their families but are being afforded no form of protection at all and are in desperate need of support.  At the same time, the threshold is not so low as to augment the fears of those who have concerns regarding an expansionist State or are worried about the State trying to take the place of parents.  If such people actually read the wording of the amendment, I hope they will see that such fears are groundless and will not be materialised.</p><p>  The best way I can finish my short contribution is to quote from the amendment itself.  Members have all studied the wording and I hope the people do as they contemplate how they will vote.  One particular phrase is worth emphasising, &quot;...the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents...&quot;.  We are talking here about the common good.  A philosopher once said that the way to judge the maturity and success of a democracy is by how it treats its most vulnerable.  We are dealing here with an articulation of the common good that recognises the young people who need our help the most, who offer the clearest vision possible of what the common good looks like.  The phrase &quot;endeavour to supply the place of parents&quot; is important.  The State is not looking to take the place of parents.  It has no such ambition and is not seeking to do so.  It is simply saying that in the case of those children who need our help the most, we will realise the common good by giving them all the help that we can.  Changing these words in the Constitution will allow us to do that better in the future.</p></speech>

When the people made a clear, strong and welcome decision on the fiscal stability treaty, this was followed shortly thereafter by the strongest delegation from the European Investment Bank that had ever come here, with a clear willingness to commit to further investment through that source.</p><p>  I will not decry the appointment of a Minister of Finance by any Prime Minister elsewhere in Europe.  There are 27 involved and there is a statement from three of them.  I return to the point that I believe in the political system being able to deliver.  As I said to Deputy MicheÃ¡l Martin, if there has been a fault on the part of the European Union in respect of its citizens - next year is the year of the citizen - it has been the failure to demonstrate the capacity to follow through and implement decisions made.  The decision of 29 June was clear and unequivocal in two respects - in the protection of the euro and the eurozone and the direct recapitalisation of banks, therefore breaking the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, and second, in improving Ireland's debt sustainability to give equal treatment where others received a deal.  On these two issues, the Minister for Finance, officials and I, at Heads of Government level, will follow through resolutely and diligently.  It is too important to have Heads of Government make a clear and unequivocal decision and not to have it implemented.  Of course, when politicians begin to negotiate on these issues, we have different points of view.  However, there is no resiling and no going back from the clarity of the decision to break the link and improve Ireland's debt sustainability.  That is where we will continue to make our efforts.  As Commissioner Rehn pointed out, he would like to have the issue dealt with by the end of October.  The Minister for Finance has made the point that, realistically, that is not achievable and that it is important to get the right deal.  In that sense, we continue to return to the foundation stone, namely, the clarity of the decision of 29 June made by the Heads of Government.  That is what is important and it needs to be implemented.</p></speech>

A judicial appointments commission is in place and assesses the applications of those who wish to be considered for appointment to the Bench.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly has a brilliant record in running the commercial court.  His comments were related to the Supreme Court.  As I said yesterday, the Chief Justice was already a member of the Supreme Court before being appointed by the President as Chief Justice.  Also, two other appointees to the Supreme Court had already been nominated to the High Court before being elevated.

The Bill will probably not be dealt with until 2013, which will be five years after the bank guarantee of 2008.  If a banking inquiry is to occur, as promised in the programme for Government, it needs to be given some legislative priority.

It has been a long time coming, some 20 years, and is a welcome development.  Without doubt, it is a very significant step towards enshrining children's rights in the Constitution.  We note that the current text does not mirror the wording agreed to by the cross-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and while the text before us is an important step forward, Sinn FÃ©in will submit amendments on Committee Stage to bring us back closer to the original agreed text.  We very much hope the Minister will give these amendments her full consideration and that the Government will not block progressive improvements to the Bill, as it stands.</p><p>  The true purpose of the Bill is to provide strong protections for children and make a real difference in their lives.  Of course, when we talk about children, we mean all of them, from every socioeconomic group and every class.  Of course, in this context, we include the children of Traveller families and I am sure the Minister understands why I make that reference in the DÃ¡il this morning.  Notwithstanding any amendment to the Constitution, if we do not have a Government-led strategy to tackle the increasing levels of child poverty within society, in the final analysis, the referendum will amount to little more than fine words.</p><p>  Last week I asked the TÃ¡naiste to commit to child-proofing the budget to be announced in December.  As he did not acknowledge my question on that occasion or give a satisfactory response, I want to put the same question today to the Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I want her to give a commitment that she will ensure Cabinet colleagues will child-proof their departmental budget cuts and tax hikes before making any final decision in advance of December's announcement.</p><p>  The reality of life for many children is a world away from the aspirations in the proposed constitutional amendment.  Over 100,000 children live in poverty and this number has increased in recent years as a result of the austerity policies of the Government and, it has to be said, its predecessors led by Fianna FÃ¡il.  If the Government or any of us is serious about making paramount the best interests of the child, we need to produce a strategy to end child poverty.  In the course of the debate the Minister needs to give a commitment that there will be no measures in the budget which will place even more children in poverty.  The charity which deals with children, Barnardos, has warned that further cuts to social welfare and public services will lead to further hardship and greater incidences of poverty and deprivation for children.  Some 200,000 children live below the poverty line, an astonishing and shameful statistic, while 500 vulnerable young people were recorded as being homeless on census night in 2011.  CSO figures released earlier this month show that the income of households with children fell four times more than that of households without children between 2009 and 2010.  Under the Government's watch, sadly, we know these figures will have increased.</p><p>  An ESRI report published in February on the distributional impact of recent budgets stated clearly that budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes, namely, reductions of 2% to 2.5% for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about 0.75% for those on the highest incomes.  The figures do not lie.  Very many people would have been surprised and alarmed to discover that, in fact, that budget had been the most regressive in a long series of austerity budgets.  The Government has made a choice.  It has sought to protect the highest earners from the worst of the financial crisis.  During its short time in office, it has deepened inequality in our society.  To put it in very stark terms, this has caused real harm to the most vulnerable adults and children.  The ESRI report shows how the Fine Gael and Labour Party budget was the first since the start of the recession that took more from the low paid than those on high incomes.  Let us consider this.  Again, the figures do not lie.</p><p>  Recent CSO figures show that almost one fifth of households with children are struggling to survive.  In 2010 some 19.5% of households were at risk of poverty.  This figure rose to 26% in homes with children aged between 12 and 17 years.  The ESRI report tells us that under Fine Gael and the Labour Party this figure will have increased.</p><p>Barnardos warns that there are increasing numbers of families for whom some level of social welfare support is essential, simply to make sure there is food on the table and electricity to heat their homes.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which knows all about these matters, has told us that 60% of the calls they receive for support are from mothers with children.  The rate of deprivation for our children is higher relative to other countries in western Europe yet, astonishingly, this Government, just like the last, seems intent on deepening this inequality over the course of its tenure.</p><p> What does this collection of facts and statistics mean in real terms for real children?  What it means for children living in consistent poverty is that they can go 24 hours without a substantial meal and are very often cold because their parents cannot heat their home.  Let us imagine that.  How are these children supposed to do homework if they are cold or hungry?  How are the same children supposed to deal with all the normal stuff of just growing up if they are unsure when their next meal might be?  If there is not enough money for food and heat then we can be very sure there is not enough money for increasing school costs, a trip to the cinema, a pair of trainers or a present for a friend's birthday.  Those are the realities and in supporting this amendment and indeed, commending the Minister, we as a party are absolutely insistent that the debate around children and their protection cannot be limited to an amendment to the Constitution.  We want that made real and the most immediate task, in our view, is addressing the issue of deprivation and poverty.</p><p> I am sure it is not lost on citizens or Members of this House that this referendum debate is taking place against the backdrop of the Fine Gael and Labour Party failure to provide an apology and redress for the women and children of the Magdelene laundries and Bethany Home.  Both parties, quite rightly, spoke out against these grave injustices when in opposition but in government they have proven very slow to act.  The integrity of Senator McAleese is not in question.  The work he is doing is a necessary part of the picture but it is not the full picture.  The work of the McAleese committee should not be used, as the Government is currently using it, as an excuse not to move forward in the provision of basic supports and services to these women and in the issuing of a full apology to them.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has repeatedly stated that there is irrefutable evidence of State involvement in these institutions.  That is an accepted fact.  In fact, legislation was enacted in this very House providing a statutory basis for incarcerating women in a Magdalene laundry in Galway.  The evidence is there, in law.  It is game, set and match and there is no issue of debate there.  It is a nonsense for the Taoiseach and his Ministers to hide behind the interdepartmental committee.  They know, I know and the dog in the street knows that the wrong perpetrated by the State, with the connivance of the State, against these women and children is on a par with what happened in the industrial schools.  </p><p> The Taoiseach's role in government was never to simply pick up where the other crowd left off.  He promised it would be different this time around.  That is what he said and people believed him.  They hoped that would be the case but they have been proven sadly wrong.  The only difference, so far, is that it appears that this Government is happy to preside over a situation where the poor get poorer and the ageing wronged still await an apology.</p><p> The Fine Gael and the Labour Party failure to protect the elderly women and children of Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home casts a shadow over their Administration.  These people were failed by the State and well the Taoiseach knows it.  Government inaction deepens the hurt and anguish these people have lived with all their lives.  The Government refuses them their pensions, speedy access to medical care and, crucially, access to counselling.  The Taoiseach refuses, for reasons that baffle me, to say out loud that we failed these women and for that we, collectively, are deeply sorry.  He refuses to tell them they did nothing wrong.  These women, so many of whom were only children when sent to the laundries, did nothing wrong.  Is it any wonder that people do not trust the State with respect to their children?</p><p> Concerns have been voiced about the 50:50 rule with regard to media coverage of referendum debate and speculation has been ongoing in that regard.  There are some on the Government benches who believe that when a proposition is put to the people the only argument that should be put forward is the one supported by the Government of the day.  A citizenâs vote is the most fundamental tool of democracy and to undermine this in any way by excluding alternative voices would be fundamentally wrong.</p><p> Families across the State have very real fears about this referendum.  I am picking that up from people and I am sure other Deputies are too.  They have experienced and seen at first-hand the failure of the State to protect our most vulnerable children.  This failure is not historic but continues to this very day.  The report of the Independent Child Death Review Group documented 196 deaths of children in the care of the HSE or who were known to the HSE between 2000 and 2010.  That report states that while good practice was adhered to in some cases, its application was sporadic and inconsistent.  The authors argued that earlier and more consistent good practice would have increased the chances that these children might have overcome their vulnerabilities.  In that regard, it must be said that there is a very clear resourcing issue for those professionals and services that deal with vulnerable young people.  People see all of that and they absorb the message it sends to them.  The result is that many people do not trust the State to protect our most vulnerable people and in particular, our children.  </p><p> What should the Government do to allay these fears?  I am speaking as someone who will campaign for this referendum and who welcomes it.  It is extremely important, in the course of this debate, that we do not dismiss people's worries and fears.  They are well grounded in the experiences of children in this State, historically and in contemporary times.  We must listen to those anxieties.  We must reassure parents that they will remain the primary carers, protectors and custodians of their children and that it is the State's role to support them in that work.  We should say to parents that rather than being threatened by this amendment and by the State taking on a responsibility for children, they should draw comfort from the fact that the State commits to intervene, in exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear and present danger to the child or the child is being abused.  We are collectively saying that we will not have any more Roscommons.</p><p>We accept that it takes a village to raise a child and that we vindicate the rights of child citizens.  That should be a source of comfort to parents not a threat, but we must be clear and categoric in our approach and aware of the mistakes that have been made in other jurisdictions - in particular in Britain - and ensure that we do not make the same mistakes.</p><p> I make all of those points to underscore the fact that we need a calm and balanced debate.  That means we will hear voices and opinions with which we fundamentally disagree.  We might even take the view that some of the views expressed are factually inaccurate but that is the nature of democratic debate.</p><p> For what it is worth, I call on broadcasters to listen to my appeal-----</p></speech>

The Government must also ensure a full and frank public debate on the referendum and address the fears of parents and citizens across the State.  Neither must the Government shy away from such fears or concerns.  It is in our collective interest that the referendum is passed.  It is a necessary and long overdue measure.  We have a collective responsibility to embrace a full and frank debate on why we must enshrine childrenâs rights into the Constitution and when we have done that we have the bigger responsibility of making the commitment real.</p></speech>

They can vote for or against an amendment to the Constitution that proposes to treat children as individuals in their own right for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.  It is 20 years since Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In the coming months, the Government hopes to submit Ireland&#8217;s update report on implementation of the convention to the United Nations.  It is fair to say that this country has been making progress in the past 18 months, but that in the 20 previous years we have seen a litany of reports each more disturbing and more heart-scalding than the next.  They are 17 damning indictments of the failure of society and politics to guarantee the safety of children.</p><p><br />  As a politician and a father this affected me no more than many others.  On coming to office it was my privilege to be able to appoint a full Cabinet Minister for children for the first time in the State in the person of Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I was and remain of the view that the children of this country deserved rather more than luck for their safety   They must be able to rely on more than &#8216;happy faults&#8217; to secure their innocence, integrity, and their future itself.  Moreover, I and the Government wanted to make this not just their social entitlement but their constitutional right.  This is a quantum change in a society where for too long children were seen and not heard.  The best place for children is within a loving and supportive home.  The referendum does not seek to change that.  Time and again, unfortunately, we have seen cases where a family for whatever reason - has failed or were unable to protect a child.  Not only that, but in some tragic cases, the family itself - as in the Roscommon case - was the most dangerous and damaging place for a child to be.  I wish to allay the fears of good and responsible parents that this will be a charter for trespass into their family&#8217;s lives.  It will not.  Great care has been taken to ensure that it is not and can never be.</p><p><br />  Since taking office, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Government have been working on the wording of the amendment.  Many Members of the House have worked hard over many years to reach this day.  The work of the All-Party Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has been an invaluable contribution; equally the efforts and contribution of campaigners, organisations and professionals who work with children and members of the legal profession must be acknowledged.  The Bill before the House proposes a new stand-alone Article 42A, titled &#8216;Children&#8217;, which will contain a series of provisions and will be put to the people as one, single, question for their approval.  The proposed constitutional amendment forms part of the wider and urgent reform agenda.  In terms of child protection, specifically, we have introduced a wide range of reforms through the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, the publication of the Children First Bill which will put the Children First national guidelines for child protection on a statutory basis and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  Child protection and support services are having a radical, long-overdue and much-needed overhaul through the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  They are all vital reforms.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, emphasised last night, none of the reforms can have the wide-ranging and permanent effect of the proposed constitutional change.</p><p><br />  The Government is committed - as we did with the European stability referendum earlier this year - to ensure that people have all the information they need to make an informed decision on the 10 November.  To facilitate that, an information website, , has been set up by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It provides information on the constitutional amendment as well as details of the wider reform programme under way in the area of child protection.  A Government information booklet will also be sent to each household in the country.</p><p><br />  The proposed referendum offers children a second chance to have a family.  The wording removes the inequalities in current adoption law.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, highlighted to the House last night that there are approximately 6,250 children in care placements at present, with more than 5,500 of the children in foster families.  The focus is already on family care.  More than 2,000 of the children have been with the same family for more than five years.  The legislation may offer them the opportunity to create an even stronger family bond in the future.</p><p><br />  Every day all over this country parents put their own fears and worries aside to give their sons and daughters the best, most secure, respectful and loving life they can even in the most difficult circumstances.  Our children are our most precious possession.  Every child - regardless of the circumstances of their birth - should be allowed not just to feel valued, but to be valued under the law as the invaluable, irreplaceable beings they are.  I am proud to speak as Taoiseach on a proposal to amend the basic law to the effect that: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&#8221;  I urge everyone, in particular parents, and others tasked with the safety of children to  make every effort to inform themselves on what this referendum  is about.  The wording of the amendment is careful and cautious.  It is formed from cross-party concern and with cross-party support, which I appreciate.  We have heard many thoughtful speeches in this House on the Bill and I look forward to hearing more.  I urge everyone to use their power as democrats to make come out and make a resounding statement in favour of the children of this country, not just for now but for generations to come.</p></speech>

Most children in this country are well looked after.  I often stand back in admiration at the way young mothers and fathers look after their children, how they educate them, take them to school, take them to football, hurling, swimming, music and dancing and all the other things children do.  One hears jocose complaints from mothers that sometimes they spend half their lives on the road ferrying their children from one place to another.  When we concentrate on the children at risk who need to be protected, under both the law and the Constitution, we should remember that it is the exception and should look at the norm.</p><p>The norm in Ireland is a situation where there are great families looking after their children, putting a great deal of effort into rearing them and ensuring their physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual development is first-class, very often making enormous sacrifices to ensure their children get the best chance possible.  We are dealing here with something that is now considered essential because of the various incidents throughout the country that came to our attention.  It is very important that the specific rights of the child should be enshrined in the Constitution so that in the very small number of exceptional cases the State may be allowed, with the protection of the Constitution, to intervene to protect those children who are at risk.  That is what is involved here.  It is important because there has been such debate about children being abused and at risk in families and other situations that the norm in Ireland, namely, decent families looking after their children and very happy children being brought forward, very often with great sacrifice to their parents, is forgotten.</p><p> I served on the committee on children's rights that worked to introduce appropriate wording to put into the Constitution.  The committee was very ably chaired by the former Deputy, Mary O'Rourke.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, were members.  The then leader of Sinn FÃ©in, Deputy CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in, made a very strong intervention and was a great attender at meetings.  Deputy Alex White represented the Labour Party and there were many Deputies and Senators of all parties who worked on that committee, clearing away much of the undergrowth and irrelevancy and allowing Members of all parties to concentrate on what was essential.</p><p> In the nature of all-party committees, there were compromises at the end.  The wording introduced, although it enjoyed the support of all parties, probably was not, in some respects, the first preference of any particular party.  In the interests of compromise and unanimity additional words were included.  It was important, therefore, when the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, took over, that the wording would be re-examined and that which was deemed to be redundant or unnecessary was taken out.  I have no objection to that because I believe the words now published by the Minister in the Bill are better, more succinct and focused than the wording that came from the all-party committee.  That is probably the view of many of the colleagues of all parties who served on that committee.</p><p> I have two points in regard to that committee.  Sometimes words are included to get consensus.  There was a phrase that some people believed should have been maintained, namely, &quot;cherishing the children of the nation&quot;.  We know its origin; it came from the 1916 Proclamation but when one considers the Proclamation that phrase was never about children.  Echoing Wolfe Tone, &quot;children&quot; referred to all the people of Ireland, the concept being that Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter would be covered by the common name of Irishman so that all the children of the nation would be cherished equally.  These were not children, however, and the reference was to citizens of this Republic.  Therefore, although it was a nice idea on the part of the committee dealing with the children and the Constitution to incorporate this wording it actually comes from a different origin and was stating something quite different.</p><p> It is also important to remember that when the Supreme Court looks at the Constitution and makes decisions on it, it expects that we, as legislators, do not get involved in inserting redundant language into what we decide is appropriate for amendment.  It looks at such on the basis that the Legislature has examined it and there is no redundant wording so that if a word is included the court will ascribe a meaning to that word on the assumption that we have scrutinised it, and that we intended a meaning when we inserted it.  It is not possible to dress up a constitutional amendment in attractive wording that might appeal to the electorate.  If we do that, the Supreme Court will decide that if we put it in we must have meant something and it will try to decide what is meant.  There can then be a ruling from the Supreme Court which could be different from the intention of the Parliament, the DÃ¡il and Seanad.  I totally approve of the manner in which the Minister pruned the wording that came from the all-party committee and brought it down to a much more succinct representation.</p><p> It is also worth noting that there has been a good record by the State in looking after children.  Unlike what happens in other countries, children at risk in Ireland receive family care through the fosterage system.  By and large, our children at risk are not put into institutions for long periods but are placed in families and have the ambience and protection of the family.  Like all other children, in effect they are brought up within families.  It is very important to acknowledge that and the great work that is done both by so many families who take children on fosterage and the State agencies that monitor their care when they are fostered.</p><p> I wish to comment on the actual debate.  Although very good speeches were made last night across party lines, giving real insight into what is required and what are the intentions of the Minister and the Government in proposing this amendment, nonetheless the debate did not get any mention in news bulletins last night.  The broadcasting institutions, including RTE, have a responsibility to cover not only conflict but also, as public broadcasters, in respect of something such as a constitutional amendment, to explain the intention and to use the debates on all sides of this House, which were excellent last night, to bring those explanations to the attention of the people.  RTE, in particular, as well as the other broadcasting institutions, has a very narrow view of what it may do in terms of covering referenda.  I do not believe it must put a stopwatch on the debate and divide it, 50:50, between those for and against.  I do not believe justice done on sentences, as in the Coughlan judgment, carries that implication.  As long as the coverage is fair and balanced, it seems to me that broadcasters are within their rights of coverage.  In a referendum such as this, where most - I believe all - Members of both DÃ¡il and Seanad, as well as the groups and non-governmental organisations that are most interested in the care of children, advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, inventing opponents to the amendment on the basis of giving 50% of the time to a non-existent set of opponents is a very peculiar way to approach this issue.  RTE should look at this again and if it gives coverage in a fair and balanced way it seems to me it will fulfil the obligations of the judgment.</p><p> There is another issue.  RTE should distinguish between its set-piece debates and news coverage.  In my view, the Supreme Court judgment is not intended to apply to news.  There is an entire area within news where RTE can help the public debate by presenting the facts and the issues, where it is not constrained by the judgment of the Supreme Court.  If it had taken the opportunity last night to report on the Second Stage debate in this House it could have done so without contravening any judgment and without having to invent a bogeyman or bogeywoman to come on and give an alternative opinion, even though such does not exist.  I would like RTE to look again at that because it is important to do so.</p><p> I received a briefing note from the Minister's Department setting out the aims of the new article and I believe this is worth putting on the record as, I am sure, speakers have already done.</p><p>It states that the central aim of the new article is directly to recognise children in their own right within the Constitution and by doing so to give children special protection because of their age and potential vulnerability.  In brief, the constitutional amendment for people to decide by referendum aims to do the following: to place the article in the Constitution which directly deals with children's rights; to revise the language used regarding when and how the State should be able to step in and protect the welfare and safety of a child to put a focus on the child.  This will continue to recognise that children are best reared by their parents and that it is only in exceptional cases where parents fail in their duty towards their children that the State should take action to ensure the safety and the welfare of children; to require that any action by the State to protect children should be proportionate, meaning that actions should be measured strictly by reference to tackling the problems causing harm to the child; to provide that the rights and protections set out in the new article should apply equally to all children regardless of whether or not their parents are married; to allow for the adoption of children in wider circumstances than at present.  This will allow for a revised approach to be set out in law for the adoption of certain children who have been reared by foster parents for a considerable period by reason of the failure of their parents to look after or care for them.  It will allow also for a new law to make possible the voluntary placement for adoption of any child, including children whose parents are married; to add to the strength of existing laws that require the best interests of the child to be the first and most important consideration for judges in deciding court cases concerning child protection and welfare, adoption, guardianship, custody of and access to any child; and to ensure that in making decisions in court cases of the kind already mentioned above the views and wishes of the child should be obtained and taken fully into account bearing in mind the child's age and maturity.</p><p> That last point is very important because it is not only that the amendment will give a specific constitutional right to the rights of children or that the State will be enabled, without any fear of crossing constitutional boundaries, to intervene to protect children in exceptional cases but when the court does intervene to protect children, the child will have a say in its own future.  That is very important.  We are all familiar with children.  Many of us have children and we know that at a very early age children have a reasonably good view of what they want and what is in their best interests.  It is very important that that right should be in the Constitution and that the court should be directed in processes protecting the interests of children to take the views of children into account.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, for the work she has done.  She has done an amazing piece of work after such a long delay.  People were talking about this 20 years ago going back to the Kilkenny incest case when there was a recommendation that this should be done.  After such a short period in Government, it is admirable that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has brought this legislation forward and that she has had consultations with many interest groups and has their confidence to the degree that they are backing this amendment.</p><p> So far the Roman Catholic Church has been silent, and the other churches have not come out on it yet.  I would like if the churches made a clear statement at an early date indicating that they favoured this referendum.</p></speech>

Aspiring to a firmer protection for children under the Constitution is welcome, and I would not in any way underestimate its impact.  It is a significant piece of work and I broadly welcome it in that parameter.</p><p>  It is somewhat ironic that we have had five referenda on the issue of the rights of the so-called unborn when the rights of born children have been systematically ignored in this State.

I welcome this measure in the context that at the very least it gives us an opportunity to discuss some of these issues and put centre stage the way we defend children's rights and how we identify those rights.</p><p>  The provision and the constitutional amendment is aspirational, which is a good thing.  As a socialist I would generally be aspirational but the disconnect here is the major gap between establishing in theory the rights of children and the reality on the ground in terms of how we can achieve what the Government said is its objective of protecting and vindicating the rights of children against a backdrop of increased economic austerity.  That is the challenge.</p><p>  One would think we would all agree that basic rights such as the right to food, health care, education and so on would be guaranteed to all children and citizens but even during the boom that was not the case.  Traveller children, asylum seeker children and others were left behind and in the new economic climate, with increased costs on families and a decrease in the family budget, it is clear that meeting the basic needs of children is becoming problematic for tens of thousands of families.  The Central Statistics Office stated that an average family needs â¬810 a week to provide adequately for its needs.  Clearly, most families in the State are well short of that.</p><p>  The idea of a secure, happy family home is being threatened by mortgage arrears and in the way the Government is implementing changes in rent allowance, with almost 100,000 people in receipt of rent allowance, many of whom are being forced to move out of the areas they have lived in because of the Government cutbacks.  Their children, some of whose parents campaigned to get them into special schools in the area, have to uproot and leave.  That is not to mention all the cuts to family income support and so on.</p><p>  It is unquestionable that this economic austerity is giving rise to serious mental health problems, depression and so on, linked to financial anxiety in many homes.  Aware reported a 29% increase in calls to its hotline and it linked that increase directly to the debt burden.  It is a constant struggle for many parents to maintain a happy home, and those who face decades of debt or the potential of eviction have a serious problem in trying to provide security for their children.  Unless we address those issues this is a lop-sided debate.</p><p>  That is particularly apparent when we examine the issue of education.  The irony is that one of the few child-centred clauses in our Constitution is the right to free primary education but the dogs on the streets know that it is not free, and many children are not accessing it properly because of economic austerity.  Education and school books costs are rising, and there is extra pressure on families.  I do not have time to develop those points but it is ironic that that right is in the Constitution but in reality it is not.</p><p>  Similarly, that is the case with the clauses whereby any school which gets public money should not have a religious ethos or expose children to indoctrination yet children do not have a right to be excluded from religious instruction as a normal part of the day.</p><p>  This week, sadly, the issue of bullying in schools has been centre stage and the rights of children in that environment must be addressed.  Huge bodies of work have been done on that but unless we address these issues we are only paying lip service in terms of the idea of protecting children's rights in an increasingly unequal society.</p><p>  That might be the reason RTE and the media are not picking up on this as much as they should.  Perhaps people believe that while it is important, and I am not underestimating that it is a step forward, they wonder how much will be achieved by it.</p><p>  Much has been made about the way this legislation will impact on vulnerable children.  The objective is to place the protection of children at the centre of decision making, which is welcome.  There is much talk about early intervention, which would be welcome, but we are being presented here with another of those gaps between reality and aspiration.</p><p> Early intervention means the appointment of further social workers and gardaÃ­ and increased welfare provision to assist those who are struggling.  One can dress it up any way one likes in referring to rationalisation and improved working methods, but the reality is that early intervention means more staff working hours and the adoption of a skilful approach by well trained individuals.  Those who are inexperienced or overworked make mistakes and can cause damage in their interventions.  Budget cuts have led to increased class sizes.  How can teachers try to identify vulnerable children when class sizes in Ireland are the second largest in Europe?  Last week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn, warned that class sizes were going to increase even further.  In view of the fact that there is going to be a shortage of 3,000 teachers in the coming years and in the light of the cutbacks in SNA numbers, how can those on the front line in the education system be expected to identify vulnerable children?  The Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na is already stretched from the point of view of resources and approximately 40 rural Garda stations have closed.  How can the force be expected to maintain a watching brief when its budget has been cut by 8%?</p><p> The issue which lies at the heart of this matter relates to social workers.  This is a matter in which a huge intervention is required.  I understand that approximately 30 social workers qualify each year from the HSE-Trinity College social work degree programme.  This is the only programme from which one can move directly to join the HSE's social work panel.  Last year, however, that panel was suspended and people did not have an opportunity to go on it.  The quotas are not being filled and the embargo on recruitment to the public sector means social workers are becoming increasingly stretched.  These individuals are doing a great deal more of their work by e-mail and engaging in a lot less direct contact.  Against this backdrop, how can children be protected?  This is a contradiction, in respect of which the Government has not provide a response.</p><p> There is a concern that the increased economic desperation and deprivation being experienced and the inability of some parents to cope could result in their having their children taken from them.  If better and enhanced supports were provided, it would lead to happier resolutions within the families to which I refer.  I am assured by those with whom I have raised this matter that the use of the term &quot;proportionate&quot; is sufficient in guarding against people losing their children.  I am sure we all hope that this will be the case.  This is, however, a point which must be borne in mind.</p><p> There has been a great deal of discussion about increasing adoption rights and giving children the opportunity to avail of a second chance in a loving home.  Obviously, the latter is something of which we would all be in favour, but we must be extremely careful in this regard.  The history of adoption in Ireland is not good.  There are tens of thousands of undocumented adoptees who have been robbed of their identities because of the way in which the State dealt with adoption in the past.  I am aware that many of the people in question are concerned that the legislation on adoption which goes hand in hand with the referendum does not deal with issues relating to them.  The legislation to which I refer focuses to a large degree on the adoption in the future of vulnerable children currently in care.  That is fine.  However, there is an urgent need to put in place a system to protect the relevant documents and files required for tracing families, etc.  The most basic right a person has is that which relates to possessing the facts relating to his or her own identity.  There is a need to place this matter centre stage.  The possibility of a child who has lived in foster care for more than three years and resided with a particular family for 18 months being adopted has the potential to be good and I welcome this development.  However, we must ensure the child's view will be central to this.  I am glad that this aspect is being respected and emphasised.</p><p> Very few people are going to oppose the referendum.  The really good aspect of the referendum is that it gives us the opportunity to discuss and highlight some of the complexities relating to the issues to which I refer.  However, we need to do a great deal more to really vindicate children's rights.  This will involve standing a large amount of Government policy in other areas on its head.  I refer, in particular, to policy relating to economic areas.  When the budget comes around, we will be calling on the Government to put its money where its aspirations lie.  If it does not do so, the State will fail children yet again.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Minister and anyone else who has been working on the proposed new article to the Constitution and whose efforts have resulted in it being brought forward for discussion.  In any set of circumstances priority must be given to discussing the needs and rights of children.  We must ensure these needs and rights are protected in law in every way possible.  There is an even greater need in this regard in Ireland because there is a history of chronic failure on the part of the State to protect children.  We have debated some of the State's failures in this regard during the past year or so, including the horrors experienced by those who were placed in the industrial schools, the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home residences.  The failures to which I refer did not just occur in the distant past, they also happened more recently.  I refer to the appallingly large numbers of children who were in the care of the State or for whom the State had a responsibility who died because it had failed to take steps to provide them with adequate protection.  The failure to which I refer continues.  We have a long way to go to ensure the rights of children will be protected.  For example, there have been reports of serious abuse and the neglect of immigrant and refugee children in direct provision hostels.  The Irish Refugee Council has called for an investigation into this matter in view of the fact that we do not know what is happening in these hostels or whether the rights of the children in them are being fully protected.  There is also the example of children being placed in adult psychiatric wards because there is not an adequate number of child psychiatric places available.  It is clearly not in the interests of children to be place in adult wards.  Another example of the State's failure relates to the fact that, as a number of previous speakers indicated, the level of child poverty has actually increased in recent years as a result of the austerity measures being imposed.</p><p>  Against this background, it is extremely important that the legislation before the House has been brought forward and that the entire population should debate how we can fully protect and vindicate the rights and welfare of children as an absolute priority.  In that context, there is no doubt that the constitutional amendment will improve the situation.  The fact that children were not specifically identified for protection within the Constitution meant that the constitutional imperative to protect the rights of the family often came in conflict with the requirement to protect children.  It is both right and proper that the Government is moving to redress the balance and ensure the rights of children in the context of being heard and protected will be vindicated and placed at the centre of the Constitution.  It is obvious that an issue also stands to be addressed in circumstances where parents who are willing to have their children adopted are impeded from doing so simply because they are married and so on.  The change in this regard is very welcome.</p><p>  Having said all of this, I must point out that there is a problem.  This is not a problem which would lead me to oppose the amendment which should be supported, but laws, constitutional amendments and words on a page do not, in and of themselves, guarantee the rights and protections children need.  Please allow me to state the obvious.  Those who were placed in industrial schools, Bethany Home residences and Magdalene laundries were overwhelmingly the children of the poor.  It was they who ended up being neglected and abused by the State.  It is still overwhelmingly the poor, the least well-off and the most vulnerable in society who have needs and difficulties and require protection.</p><p>Simply asserting the legal right of children to be heard and protected, without addressing the root cause, will not solve the problem.  Therefore, a constitutional imperative to protect children has to be backed up with the required resources to make this happen.  I refer specifically to the health and social services to be provided.  We must ensure child poverty is eliminated, that no child is in need of food or adequate housing and health care, that no child is disadvantaged educationally or will be disadvantaged if the State does not provide necessary supports for children in trouble or in difficulty or subject to abuse or neglect.  While this legislation is welcome and points in the right direction, everything else the Government is doing in all of these areas is moving us in precisely the opposite direction.  It is moving us away from a situation where children would be adequately protected.</p><p> Child care teams must be fully resourced, but the Children First guidelines for the protection of children have not been adequately implemented and remain to be placed on a statutory basis, although I acknowledge the Minister is working on this aspect of the matter.  However, resources such as sufficient numbers of social workers will be needed.  It is a question of how to square the â¬700 million in further cuts due to be made in the next budget and the â¬2 billion in health cuts made in recent years with a commitment to protect children and how to provide the resources necessary to protect children, considering the level of cuts planned in health funding in the December budget.  How do we deal with the cap on the number of special needs assistants when we know that there are children who need support in the classroom and are being denied it or are not receiving the same level of support as they received in the past because of the cuts imposed by the troika in order to bail out bankers?  These cuts run directly counter to the commitment to protect children.</p><p> Yesterday I raised the issue of cuts in the home help service.  What happens if a mother develops schizophrenia or another debilitating illness and needs support and assistance but does not receive it?  It is often the case that young children and teenagers have to look after their parents, with all of the consequences there might be for their development, rights and so on.</p><p> The policy of cutting lone parent supports, the number of special needs assistants, home help hours and the incomes of the least well-off will inevitably drive children into dangerous situations because the poverty that is visited on their parents has knock-on consequences for them.  Unless we address the policies which are causing poverty, it is difficult to see how this proposal can make a significant difference.</p></speech>

Durkan.</p><p><br />  I commend my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for bringing this transformational proposal for a referendum before the House.  I also commend all Members of the House for the cross-party support for this measure.  I commend the civil society groups which have been forceful in their support for the amendment of the Constitution on the rights of children.  That support is crucial.  However, it is important that a full debate take place on the airwaves and in the media generally.  I share the concern of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that the media provide for a full debate on the issue.  I acknowledge there are constraints in terms of balance, but this should not stop the media from airing and discussing the issue which is crucial for democracy and, in particular, the welfare of children.  We should not take the view that the proposal need not be fully debated and should be nodded thorugh.  I commend all those who have participated in the various committees which have discussed this issue and the wording of the referendum.</p><p><br />  There has been much debate and discussion and also a recognition of what has happened in the past.  There have been 17 reports since Judge Catherine McGuinness's report on the Kilkenny incest case.  We have all been struck by the appalling manner in which many children were treated in the past.  The case I remember most is that of Sophia McColgan and what happened in her family.  Despite the fact that various agencies of the State were involved with the family, it took a long time before there was an intervention.  The proposed amendment of the Constitution, if agreed to by the people, will bring about a change in how children will be treated in the future.  It will be a case of building a system of protection to give every child in the State, particularly vulnerable children, the opportunity to have a nurturing and secure childhood.  It is about changing attitudes to children in order that they will be seen and heard and that their views will have weight and consequence.  It is about enshrining in the Constitution a vision of children as citizens recognised as having an entitlement to inherent rights that must be vindicated.  The principle that the voice of children should be heard is very important.</p><p><b></b>We do not wish to have the debate distracted by what is not contained in the proposed wording.  The role of the family is still central and Article 41 is not being interfered with.  In a small minority of cases there are dangers to the safety and welfare of children and the amendment of the Constitution will provide the State with the authority to intervene in such cases in clearly defined circumstances.  However, there will be safeguards, a balance and proportionality in any measure undertaken.</p><p><br />  I refer to the proposed Article 42(A).2.2Â°.  This important reform addresses a lacuna in Bunreacht na hÃireann which currently does not refer to the circumstances in which adoption will be provided for in law.  In the case of foster parents adopting a child, the current test is extremely arduous.  As such, the number of children in foster care who are adopted is very low.  The Minister indicated last night that the number was just 16 children in 2010 and 2011.  More than 2,000 children have been with the same foster family for more than five years and have not had the opportunity to be adopted.</p><p>The proposed wording will allow the Oireachtas to debate and pass a new adoption Act.  In this regard, I commend the Minister on the publication of the draft adoption (amendment) Bill 2012 in tandem with the referendum proposal.  This will afford citizens a clear perspective on the constitutional and legislative reforms that will flow from a "Yes" vote on 10 November.</p><p> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to the broader range of issues relating to children and child welfare.  It is important to emphasise that the proposed constitutional amendment is just one measure, albeit perhaps the most important one, in the Government's reform agenda in the area of child protection.  Efforts in this area include the passing of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, the introduction of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 and ongoing work on the Bill to place the Children First guidelines on a legislative basis.  The proposed child and family and support agency, functioning independently of the Health Service Executive, will ensure the principles enshrined in the constitutional amendment become a reality in the lives of thousands of children in this country.</p><p> The forthcoming campaign will be beneficial for democracy by allowing citizens to focus on the future of our children.  This is an issue that is central to any democratic society but one that has, unfortunately, been too often neglected in the past.  The referendum will mark a new beginning in efforts to safeguard the welfare of children and to cherish childhood.  The debate in this House is the starting point of that process but we must also strive to engage the broader public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600015#N00200"><p>I join other speakers in welcoming the introduction of the constitutional amendment.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her ministerial colleagues on the time, effort and dedication that went into the preparation of the proposal which is before us today.  Given that there has been some debate as to whether it is really necessary, it is important to reflect on the reasons for the bringing forward of the proposed constitutional amendment.  The unfortunate reality is that it is indeed necessary.  The evidence of the past 20 years or so has shown that for one reason or another and in various circumstances, children in this country were not only neglected but wilfully neglected and had their rights seriously undermined.  This was the case even during the period which became known as the Celtic tiger era and it was not just the children of families in poverty who experienced it.  In fact, throughout the past two decades there was a serious erosion of the individual child's rights which pointed clearly to a deficiency in the system.  If action could not or was not taken, for whatever reason, we must now find ways to address that deficiency.  The objective must be to ensure there is no recurrence of what happened in the past.</p><p>  As I said, the view has been expressed in some legal quarters that the proposed constitutional amendment and accompanying legislation are not necessary.  Everybody is entitled to their opinion, of course, but I reject that view.  What is true is that while the amendment certainly should not be necessary, unfortunately it is.  That is the difference.  Over the years there have been numerous cases showing clear evidence that where children were subjected to serious deprivation and wilful neglect, there was an inability or unwillingness on the part of the State and its institutions to intervene.  It is important to consider these issues from a child's perspective.  Children are vulnerable and very much react to what they see around them.  They need to feel they are in a secure and stable environment, whether in a family setting, in an institution, at school or at play.  Everything is a challenge to children.  If one studies a child's reaction in a strange environment, one will see that he or she is drinking in the surroundings and will inevitably react as he or she knows best.  What of the child whose best interests are not being served, whether in the family setting or otherwise?  Such a child becomes accustomed to whatever he or she is being subjected to on an ongoing basis.  It must be an appalling thing for a small child to find himself or herself in that situation and not to know any other way.  It is equally appalling that adults who should know better allow these types of situations to prevail.</p><p>  That is why we are now obliged to insert into the Constitution a specific measure which sets out clearly the rights and entitlements of children and the need to ensure they are protected in all circumstances.  It does not follow, however, that the State is obliged to intervene between child and parent.  As several speakers have observed, the family already retains a privileged position under our Constitution and must be protected.  That will not change.  Only in particular and specific circumstances, where it is clear that the family situation is failing, will the State have a responsibility to intervene.  Several speakers suggested that it should be open to any person to intervene in such circumstances, but I am not convinced by that argument.  Regardless of who intervenes, there will now be a provision in the Constitution which clearly sets out to protect the well-being, rights and entitlements of children.</p><p>  Some of us have been in this House longer than we care to remember and were members of health boards in the past.  That experience was a great school of learning in so far as child welfare is concerned.  Many people working in the health services over the years were futuristic in their attitude and recognised the need for provisions specifically to address the concerns of those dealing with children's welfare.  These people expressed their views on the matter liberally and some took action, by way of pilot schemes and so on, to introduce measures which they hoped might be adopted on a general basis.  We had an opportunity to learn the full extent and circumstances of neglect in the various cases that have been brought to our attention in recent years.  We must not forget, however, that the same degree of neglect still goes on today.  I am sure a week does not go without some incident of this nature being brought to the attention of public representatives.  Sometimes these matters are simple to resolve and sometimes not.  It is an ongoing issue.</p><p>  Looking beyond the constitutional proposal, it vital that we have effective follow-up in the area of child and youth services.  I and others have tabled parliamentary questions to encourage this development in the future.  The need for a comprehensive support service for youth was never more obvious than at present.  There was a tendency during the Celtic years to neglect the basics and to revel in our apparent wealth.  In fact, we neglected many issues of major importance.  We now have an opportunity to ensure, in the context of the legislation coming on stream, that we have an adequate and comprehensive back-up service for children at various stages in their development.  Children must never find themselves disadvantaged or pushed into a situation where they are exploited or have their well-being and welfare placed in jeopardy.</p><p> Deputies have frequently debated the issue of out-of-hours services.  One positive aspect of the constitutional amendment is that the provision, as laid down in the Constitution, will have to be observed.  Nothing can change that fact and there can be no deviation from that provision.  It cannot be watered down in any way, which means we will not be able to decide that we will only do certain things in certain circumstances but will be required to do what must be done.  </p><p> Although a great many families have suffered as a result of the economic downturn, this does not necessarily mean that people who have suffered economic deprivation will reject their children.  Far from it because history shows that seeking to ensure the best for their children has been the hallmark of 99.9% of parents in this country.  That will remain the position, which is as it should be.  However, circumstances will arise where it will be clear that the welfare and well-being of a child are at risk.</p><p> A fair amount of other legislation is proposed and will be helpful.  For example, it is important to note, as the Minister of State and her colleague, the Minister for Finance, have done, that more than 2,000 children have been living for more than five years with foster families.  Confidence is important to young children growing up and living in a safe environment and feeling secure assist in their development.  While foster care is helpful in this regard and we are fortunate to have a system of fostering in place, a question mark about whether the care will continue hangs over all children in foster care at all times.  Uncertainty is unfair to children and I hope it will be addressed in the context of the forthcoming constitutional amendment.  It is of critical importance that we provide the supports families require and that where intervention proves necessary, it is undertaken in a positive manner that protects children and enhances and supports families in the first instance. </p><p> Nobody should view this legislation as a threat or as in any way undermining the position of the family.  That is not the intention behind the Bill, as all Deputies recognise.  At the same time, while Ireland is not unique in the number of cases of child abuse and neglect, we are all aware of what should have been done in the past and what must be done in the future.  This legislation means we now know it will be done.  However, as with all legislation that is brought before the House, it will only be as good as its implementation.  If we fail to enforce or operate any aspect of this or other legislation, we will have serious questions to answer. </p><p> The country has come through a terrible experience in recent years.  Having been at the top of the economic pile, as it were, we have plunged into an abyss.  In such circumstances, individuals and entire groups in society tend to be ignored.  This is a danger to which we need to be alert.  For this reason, we must try to ensure that, in accordance with the sentiments expressed in the legislation, we live up to what we set out to do rather than only paying lip service to its provisions.  We must put in place the measures and supports that are necessary because they will bear rich fruit in creating a new generation of children who can have a degree of assurance that they have security and support, either in a family environment or, in the event of the failure of their family, from a second family.  It is hoped such children will be able to develop into well adjusted individuals with the confidence required in this challenging world.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Government's decision to hold the referendum on a Saturday.  I hope it is one that will hold for future votes.  I had a discussion at the weekend with a highly aggrieved eight year old who wanted to know the reason we were holding a referendum for children and the reason she was not getting a day off school.  Not everyone can win.</p><p>  A narrative is emerging on the benches opposite, generally from newer Deputies, that nothing was done before the Minister's appointment and that she did all the work on this issue in the past 18 months.  While I accept that she has done considerable work, this narrative ignores the work of previous Ministers, including the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews; our late and much missed colleague, Brian Lenihan; the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, on which I served for several months in the previous DÃ¡il.  As an aside, that cross-party committee which was chaired by our former colleague, Ms Mary O'Rourke, showed how a committee of the Houses could work.  It was well chaired and supported, properly resourced and its members had access to all the legal expertise members required.  As we struggle to find models for parliamentary committees following last year's referendum, we would do well to examine the way in which it operated.  The emphasis on trying to achieve cross-party consensus on this issue was the reason it took so long to hold the referendum.  However, alongside the process on the constitutional amendment, significant legislation was implemented in many areas and substantial investment was made in physical infrastructure for children, including community child care facilities.  The subtle narrative that the Minister has waved a magic wand and suddenly transformed everything is wrong and unfair to those who served previously in the House.</p><p>  It was extraordinary how much time the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children devoted to definitions of specific words.  As someone who is not a lawyer, I noted the passion with which legal experts discussed words which laypersons believed to have the same meaning.  Lawyers have an amazing skill to ascribe to one word many meanings which were probably never intended in the English language.  The great thing about the referendum on 10 November is that the lawyers and, to a certain extent, legislators will have to step aside and allow children to step forward and finally have their day out.  However, we owe children and for this reason we, as legislators, cannot fully step back.  It would be wrong to believe the task of protecting children will be done and dusted when or if the referendum is passed. </p><p>  During the contributions of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, I reflected on how we would engage members of the public in the debate on the referendum.  During the years people were shocked to the core by many of the reports published on individual cases such as the death of Kelly Fitzgerald.  One of the difficulties we face is that, having been engaged and horrified by the many cases of neglect and institutional support that emerged in the past, people appear to believe the problem has gone away.  We need to remind them that children in these cases were mistreated or abandoned by their families under the watch of the State.  For this reason, we must do everything possible, including passing this constitutional amendment, to ensure we do not wake up some morning to read similar reports in the newspapers of institutional neglect.</p><p>It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge that during this time of much neglect and people dropping balls, there were many heroes within the system.  There were many social workers who tried to battle lack of resources and, more important, a legal system which did not help them do their jobs.  There were many who stood up to the plate, some of whom paid with their jobs.  There were the foster families who will, for once and for all, get some sort of certainty because of this referendum.  Deputy Durkan put his finger on their amazing work by stating they did it in uncertain circumstances.  These families provided safety, a home and the security of the family unit to many children.  I have read stories of foster parents who had up to 1,000 children go through their families over the years.  These are the heroes during this time.</p><p> There were also many people who stood forward to be advocates in many of the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, like Mr. Geoffrey Shannon who has been a persistent and consistent advocate for children's rights.  For those concerned that this referendum may open up the care system and push more children into care, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon's words are important.  He says it will lead to the right children going into the care system.  That is the children who are lost to the system, whose rights  were ignored as was the State's responsibility to them, whose health and future was destroyed because the State could not act.  These are the kind of children who need to be brought into the care system.  These are the children who will, if this referendum is passed, get the care and attention they need.</p><p> We will be proposing some amendments to strengthen the referendum which will be discussed with my colleague, Deputy Troy.  It is interesting to watch this House unite fully behind this referendum.  It is important we mobilise people in the coming weeks.  The date for the referendum, 10 November, is only a short time away.  It is important that the information that is needed will get to people in a cogent and understandable way.  There are complex issues here and the difficulty with them is that they can be twisted to suit agendas of which we might not even have thought.  Suddenly in the middle of a campaign, these could become firelighter issues.  To avoid that, people need to be given proper information well ahead of 10 November.</p><p> Although the House has united behind this referendum and all suggestions are that it will be passed, it is incumbent on all of us to go out there and fight for it.  We must explain it to those in our constituencies.  We cannot take this referendum for granted.  If we do so, we are taking those children who fell out of care and who were abandoned by the State, some of whom may not have survived that abandonment, for granted too.  We owe it to those children, to their families and to those who stood up to the plate that the referendum is passed with a large turnout.  It would be wrong, given all the reports we have had into the neglect of children by so many State, church and education institutions, not to.  This is an opportunity to say, as a country, this is the end of such neglect and the start of something different.</p><p> If it is to be the start, then the Minister's job is not finished after 10 November.  Her job then will be to ensure the wording, the ethos and the preference of this amendment are backed up by resources and social workers.  We must finally resolve the issue of the on-call social worker.  Children are not nine to five; their difficulties are 24 hours, seven days a week.  We need a system that responds to them on that basis.  I welcome the fact the Minister published the adoption legislation.  It is important it is enacted and properly resourced.  As Deputy Durkan, who has been in this House much longer than I have, stated, the intention is great but the difficulty is that after 10 November we will move on to the next item like the budget.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure the necessary resources and the legislation are put in place to turn this constitutional amendment to Bunreacht na hÃireann into a practical format which will benefit people's lives.  It is also incumbent on her to ensure the social workers on the ground are empowered as soon as possible.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work to date but her job is only starting.</p></speech>

As has been said, this issue of constitutionally recognising children's rights has been under consideration for some time.  The Minister's predecessor had been working diligently on this for a long time.  While I am not an advocate of emergency legislation or constitutional amendments, it has been quite some time since the range of issues which gave rise to this referendum, such as the institutional care of children, children in society and the adequacy of family circumstances in individual cases to cater for their needs, have been considered.</p><p>  The proposed Article 42A will recognise and affirm the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child with laws enacted to protect and vindicate them.  In the exceptional circumstances where the capacity of the family to cater for and avoid any level of neglect to children is a problem, the State will be in a position, as the guarantor of the common good, to step in and provide the children with foster or adoption facilities so they can move to a new family environment which will set the foundation for their well-being in the years ahead.  The Minister is also bringing forward new legislation for adoption.  Bringing the two forward in tandem is wise at this time.</p><p>  I have no doubt this referendum will give rise to much legal debate.  I hope, however, we do not get into a debate about competing rights â the rights of the family on the one hand and the rights of the individual child on the other.  This legislation is essentially about providing the best possible family ambience for all children.</p><p>  At this point there is no harm in deliberating on some of the underlying societal problems we have.  Louth and east Meath have new urban centres sitting side by side with rural towns.  From time to time, the whole gamut of social problems comes up on the radar of my constituency clinics.  During the Celtic tiger era, I was always struck how some schools' boards of management set up breakfast clubs for pupils.  On many occasions, I saw the benefit of these clubs at first hand in the schools.  If a schoolteacher finds children coming to school hungry, there is an underlying social problem.  It is not always possible for social workers to go into individual family circumstances and effect change overnight.  We need to bear this in mind.</p><p>Society and societal attitudes and values have changed remarkably in this country in the past 25 or 30 years.  Perhaps the problems that this legislation is focused on existed previously but because we had different societal attitudes or values they did not surface in the public domain to the extent that they are surfacing nowadays.</p><p> It is not only the extremes.  Inevitably, the media and the public view will always focus on the extreme cases, no matter what the subject of debate is.  The old principle that hard cases make poor law is relevant in these circumstances.  Many families are in difficult socioeconomic circumstances now, more so than they would be in the normal cycle of economic well-being in the country, and they need to be considered.  I imagine the proposed amendment is not regarded as a panacea to tackle these individual problems.  The Legislature should consider these things.  In recent times we had a crisis in funding in the health service, which is rather important for many families in the circumstances we are debating today.  A decision was taken to transfer â¬35 million earmarked for the mental health sector to plug a hole somewhere else.  That decision should be reflected on and reconsidered.  There are significant mental health problems.  Some are direct and some are indirect contributory factors to the problems under discussion here.  There is a need to provide more resources to help tackle these problems.  The mental health support programme in the Department of Health has an Achilles heel.  Mental health is regarded as an area that we can provide for only if we have some money here and there.  As a society we need to consider the priorities in that area and to provide the resources for it.</p><p> I hope the debate does not turn into a tug-of-war between the priorities and needs of the family on the one hand and the individual child on the other.  I am sure that is not what was envisaged but it is something we need to bear in mind.  There has been a change in the community support framework.  No matter what the society, we have a prejudicial view that community activity only takes place in a rural environment, but the potential for it to occur in an urban environment is even more obvious provided we have good, well-motivated community leaders to make it happen.</p><p> I recall a visit to a particular school in Dundalk which focused on special needs education.  The teachers were involved in service apprenticeships and youth work around the town.  The school was in a area of socioeconomic deprivation.  I was particularly impressed with one thing.  The teacher in charge of the school went to households where children were missing from school for several days to see where they were and to ensure that their homework was done and that the work given to them by the school on that day or previous days was undertaken.  We need to actively encourage family support to ensure there can be enhancement or improvements.  No matter what the level of academic activity or study, it is possible with diligence and application in the family environment to effect change and improvement.  Perhaps as a community we should consider where we can go into individual households and help them to reorganise.  The legal empowerment to do that may be missing now but we need to consider this area.  I say this as someone who has been in the House for several years.</p><p> There will be a clear and tangible benefit to us if we support families in need.  Inevitably this will entail further resources being made available to us.  It is a question of prioritising and anticipating the social difficulties that give rise to the problems on which this debate is focusing.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  I support what is being proposed.  I wish the Minister well and I thank her predecessors for their work in this area as well as the officials who have been dealing with the preparatory work for the referendum.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the endeavours of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, with respect to the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  The proposed new Article 42A.1 states: "The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights."  Why is this needed?  Why do we need to have this debate if we have a Constitution with the provisions of Articles 40, 41 and 42?  Are these not sufficient to safeguard the rights of children?  These questions have been raised by some voices in society opposed to the current amendment.  I admit to being left in some confusion about why anyone could continue to raise these questions today.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary is quite right: we need to be on message when it comes to this issue as we approach a difficult and challenging time economically in this country.  Let us not forget that during the past 20 years, from the Kilkenny incest investigation report in 1993 through to all the revelations and reports into child sex abuse, testimony has been given by thousands of children who have suffered throughout the history of the State since Independence.  This has continued up to the most recent reports of the deaths of children in the care of the State.  We can be in no doubt of the need to amend the Constitution.  Society's attitudes allowed these abuses to continue and they must be challenged.  This amendment, particularly the article quoted above, will lay down a marker to help and foster a new attitude in this country to children and their rights.</p><p>  One significant change that will result from the amendment is that all children will be treated equally with regard to adoption, regardless of the marital status of their parents.  All children will be treated equally when it comes to the protection of their welfare.  The first legislative act to follow from the amendment will be the Adoption (Amendment) Bill.  This will allow for children of married parents who have been placed in the care system and abandoned or who have been subject to serious failure in respect of the duty of care of children by their parents to be eligible for adoption.  The spirit of the amendment will demand further legislative acts.  It will change the philosophy of the Government with respect to underpinning the care of children in society.</p><p>  Two areas that need attention come immediately to mind.  The first is the need for an improvement in the standard and quality of how we approach the welfare of children in the care of the State.  Second, we must be in a position to guarantee that no child or vulnerable young adult will ever be placed in an adult mental ward or mental health unit.  There are many others to which I am keen to refer, and I thank the Minister for her availability and understanding in this respect.  I welcome the philosophy with which the Minister has approached this Bill and I warmly and unconditionally support her in her endeavours in this respect.  I understand what we are trying to achieve here, but the country must also understand what we are trying to achieve.  This has been a key objective of both Government parties in our manifesto and it is a key area of the programme for Government.  It is important that the country sees that we are honouring this.</p><p> While economic issues continue to dominate the political agenda in this country, there remain many important issues that require attention and this is one in which I look forward to playing a role with respect to communication.  This referendum has been a journey of a thousand miles, but we must take care and ensure that no scare tactics engender challenge to the passing of this vital amendment.  I note from discussions with Labour Party members across the country that they will be active on the ground in this campaign and it is incumbent on all political parties to play a role in ensuring that this amendment is successfully passed.</p></speech>

As Deputy Keaveney stated, this was a promise in the Labour Party manifesto and it was also in the programme for Government.  Therefore, I am delighted that we are holding a referendum on this issue on 10 November.  I am delighted because the children's referendum has been a long time coming.  A total of 17 different reports since 1993 have outlined the State's failings in child protection since its foundation.  Each of those reports described in horrific detail the ordeals that children had to go through because of either family or State neglect and I think we all agree that these situations cannot be allowed to continue.  The sad reality is that all public representatives have come into contact with persons whom the State has let down.  It is incredibly difficult to listen to their individual stories knowing that we all were part of a society which allowed this to happen.  Voting "Yes" to this amendment on 10 November will give children who are being neglected or abused a much better chance at getting the protection they need when they need it.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment has been carefully put together.  There were 64 different meetings of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  Over the past year the Minister and her staff have been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the amendment does not take away from any other right that is currently in the Constitution.  This is an important point to make and one that we will need to continue making over the next seven weeks.</p><p>  This referendum is about reaffirming the Irish people's commitment to the protection of children.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, the amendment once again confirms the status of the family as the best place to raise a child.  It is not that the State knows more than the family about how to raise a child.  There is a concern out there that some groups may use the status of the family as a way to campaign negatively against this referendum.  I hope this is not the case, and that we are facing into a referendum campaign that will be positive.  I would hate to see some sectors in society use this campaign to promote their own narrow social agendas.  Let us take the opportunity to say to each child who is growing up in this country that he or she is important and the State will provide for him or her when others cannot.</p><p>  My party is planning a positive campaign.  We have appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to lead this campaign as our national director of elections.  She met with her campaign team yesterday and they are planning a wide range of activities such as putting up posters and distributing leaflets across the country, and also going out to knock on doors and ask members of the public to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.  Our membership will be right behind us.  I myself was out knocking on doors in Kells last weekend and I spoke to several hundred people.  The key message for me was that people know the referendum is being held and welcome it, but my worry is that they said almost universally that it would sail through.  This will not sail through unless we convince people to go out and vote for it.  That will be the key message for me and for my team over the next few weeks, and one that the Government must bear in mind.  We need people to go out and vote &quot;Yes&quot; for this.  Sitting at home will not pass the amendment.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister and her staff for constructing a form of wording that has been welcomed by the vast majority of child protection groups out there and by others in society, and I wish her all the best in this referendum campaign.</p></speech>

I also commend the Government, and indeed the Minister, for producing a Bill the wording of which is widely lauded by political society and civil society alike.</p><p>  Currently, children's rights are lacking, and the Constitution as it stands is failing them.  The obvious absence of provision for children's rights in Bunreacht na hÃireann is stark.  We have seen evidence of the impact of this absence before now and we need to make this a thing of the past.  It has been obvious that this major problem needs to be rectified, and the answer to a legal problem can only be a legal remedy.  As such, a fundamental change to the way we treat children in the Constitution is necessary.</p><p>  Historically, parents' rights were seen as paramount and, despite evidence to the contrary, it was widely accepted that parents knew best.  The family was afforded special protection by the State.  This special protection can be seen in many different cases over the years and while no one is denying that the family has a special interest and should have that place of paramount importance in the Constitution, it cannot be used to denigrate the rights of children as a secondary issue.</p><p>  The Kilkenny incest case, the Ryan commission report, the baby Ann case and the Roscommon incest case are all glaring examples of failings not only by the legal system but by successive Governments that have shied away from implementing the legal changes necessary to protect our children.  When we look back over these reports, the details of which can only be described as abhorrent, it is clear that the State failed to protect the victims in each.  The Kilkenny incest case highlighted a legal stumbling block.  It found that the strong emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution could give a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of children.  The proposed amendment means that children will be protected from harm in the future and will place the child at the centre of decision-making regardless of his or her parents' marital status.</p><p>  The Ryan report shocked the nation.  That children were suffering systematic abuse in more than 200 State-funded institutions was a blatant indication of the lack of protection afforded to them.  In that report it was advised that the needs of children should be foremost in all policies affecting children.  This amendment ensures that in any court proceedings the interests of the child will be paramount.  Such a move should bring about a greater focus on these issues through our child care policies.</p><p>  The baby Ann case saw the Supreme Court rule in favour of a child's natural parents even though baby Ann had been given up for adoption by them two years previously.  This was in recognition of the special protection given to parents in the Constitution, yet there was no individual protection afforded to Ann, the child at the centre of the case.  The amendment will provide that the rights and protections enjoyed by children are to be enjoyed by all children irrespective of their parents' marital status.</p><p>  The Roscommon incest and abuse case, in which the married parents of a large family sexually abused their children for more than a decade, was another stark example of failure by the State and its legal architecture to protect children.  In this case the children's mother was able to secure a High Court order preventing a local health board from taking the children into care. Consequently, the children stayed with their abusers for many more years than they should have.  Constitutional guidance gave priority to the marital family.  This type of failure would be prevented by this constitutional amendment.</p><p>  I could go on.  In all, there are 17 major reports on gross child protection failings - 17 tragedies in which vulnerable children suffered abuse and neglect.  To echo what the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, said yesterday, we are at last being informed by the bitter lessons of the past.  We have learned from the dark history of our past when children's interests were ignored.  The proposed constitutional amendment will provide the legal tools to ensure these gross failings cannot happen again.  Our country will be constitutionally bound to treat future generations fairly and equally and with their best interests at the very centre of decision making.  Article 42A is an important step in strengthening the protection of all children in the State.  It is a most welcome development, identifying children as much more than the property of their parents or the State.  They are included in our society as children in their own right - vulnerable individuals who enjoy security and protection as an inherent right.</p></speech>

We had just come out from under British occupation, we had many Victorian values and we had a different, imposed legal system.</p><p>The past 70 years in this State have seen a seismic shift in attitudes, particularly towards marginal sections of society.  As a people, we have moved away from Victorian thinking towards more open and liberal attitudes as to how citizens should be treated.  Up to quite recently, societal thinking on children could be best summed up by the phrase &quot;Children should be seen but not heard.&quot;  This has changed and society now genuinely seeks the best welfare of the children of the nation.  This is partly because children are vulnerable and require protection, but in the context of resources it is also because we recognise our children are the greatest possible investment we can make for the future.  Also, the needs of children have changed since the Constitution was written.  Change has come about for these reasons and because of the examples of cases where children were abused in their homes and institutions and the State, for whatever reason, was powerless to act effectively.</p><p><br /> I remember reading newspapers and listening to comment on some of the more horrific cases of child abuse in family homes.  I was angry as a citizen that in my name the State had failed those vulnerable children.  I remember feeling a sense of frustration that the Government, which was acting on my behalf and on behalf of the nation, could not get its act together and do the right thing by children.  I hope no Irish person will ever have to go through such frustration and anger, because the State was no good to children who were abused.  The State should have been there <i>in loco parenti</i>s to ensure the right thing was done for those children, but the State let them and the nation down.  It should have made a resolution then that this hurt could never happen again.</p><p><br /> This is what makes this referendum so important and I commend the Minister and the Department on bringing it forward.  Some people will criticise it and many will think it goes too far and that an evil state exists to remove children from good parents.  However, there will be safeguards within the legislation.  There have been examples, particularly in Britain, of where social services went totally overboard and misunderstood communications between social workers and children, whether this was a result of inadequate social work education or policy.  Fundamental mistakes were made there which were very painful for parents and damaging to children.  Therefore, the policies we put in place must be tight because the last thing we want is for the social workers intervening to protect the child to instead damage the interest of the child.  We cannot and will not tolerate that.</p><p><br /> We need to modernise the Constitution to reflect the realities as they are today.  Constitutional reform is necessary so that we, as a Government and society, can affirm children as full citizens of the State, with rights both within the family unit and where necessary separate from the family unit.  Under the current Constitution, children enjoy the same rights as all citizens, but this does not reflect the fact that the needs of children are vastly different from those of adults.  Currently, there is no special status for children in the Constitution.  They are practically invisible in it.  What may be interpreted from the Constitution is that the rights of the family may supersede the rights of children, as pointed out by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, the chairperson of the Kilkenny incest investigation, a long time ago.  This needs to be rectified and that is the reason this amendment is necessary.  If anybody questions the necessity for the amendment, the Kilkenny investigation demonstrates simply a good, painful example of the need for it.</p><p><br /> The referendum, if passed, will give children rights within the Constitution for the first time.  Article 42(A).1 will state: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  This is the first time the State will acknowledge the rights of children as individuals with constitutional rights.  Sinn FÃ©in will propose an amendment to this to include the word &quot;equally&quot;.  I know the Minister would not want any unintended discrimination against children here, whether based on class, gender, creed or race and therefore we will propose this amendment.</p><p><br /> Article 42(A).2 and 3 will aim to rectify the double standards that in the past prevented agencies from intervening in a family case where a child was at risk, or where agencies were involved, did not provide them with the policies and the rights to make a difference to the rights of those children.  An example of this is to be seen in the Roscommon abuse case.  Due to the constitutional position of the marital family under Irish law, a higher risk threshold must be reached before the State can intervene when a child is at risk.  Furthermore, a child of a marital family generally, may not be adopted, even if in the care of the State for the whole of its life.  It is legally possible to provide for adoption under the Constitution, but it is very difficult to do and rarely happens due to the legal difficulties.</p><p><br /> I disagree with those who say the family will lose some of the protection afforded by the Constitution.</p></speech>

The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.  It is anticipated the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session.  It is my intention that the child and family support agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in January 2013.  The final report of the task force that I established to advise on the necessary transition programme to establish a child and family support agency made recommendations on a number of key issues, including the range of services which, in the opinion of the task force, should fall within the remit of the new agency.  These recommendations are being given detailed consideration by me and my Department in preparation for the establishment of the new agency.</p><p><br />  The new agency, which will assume responsibility for children and family services that are currently provided by the HSE and the Family Support Agency, will be a dedicated agency with a sole focus.  It will have approximately 4,000 staff and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million.  The agency will be headed by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, as the chief executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team.  The recruitment of this team is at an advanced stage.  This is at the heart of our programme of reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key child and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms that are already under way under the national director for children and families, Mr. Jeyes.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements, including the continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of these services.  I have spoken on a number of occasions in this House about the lack of consistency in approach when families throughout the country look for services.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The reform programme also provides for the introduction of legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis; the establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services in order to bring transparency and accountability to the use of resources to meet national priorities; the transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new agency, the merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over &#8364;26 million into the child and family support agency and the consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new agency.  At the heart of the new agency will be a new service delivery framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases so that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support.  The new agency will represent the practical application of a new approach towards proportionate service responses, an approach which is central to the constitutional amendment on child protection which will be put before the people on 10 November.</p></reply>

If she wishes to have the new agency up and running by January, she will have to bring legislation before the Oireachtas soon.  The Minister will agree that early intervention is crucial.  It is important to ensure there is early intervention in cases of child neglect.  Will there be any additional recruitment for the new agency?  How many staff have been transferred from other Departments so far?  I presume this process has already started so that the January deadline can be met.</p></speech>

We have established a shadow agency - an agency within an agency, in effect - within the HSE.  Mr. Jeyes has been managing that process over the last year.  We have reduced the number of managers from 34 to 16.  We have provided for more direct accountability to Mr. Jeyes as manager.  Those on the front line are now in much closer contact with their managers.  The 4,000 staff will include staff from the child care and residential sectors and the Family Support Agency.  A great deal of work has been done in the HSE to identify those members of staff who will fall within the remit of the new agency.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for services like the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board, youth services and adoption and fostering services.  Ongoing work is being done to identify the point at which other services might make the transition to the new agency.  As the Deputy knows, the task force made a wide series of recommendations in its report.  The new agency will be established and will be dealing with its core services by January 2013.  Certain other services will move into the agency in the medium to longer term.  It will depend on the outcome of the analysis and the decisions to be made by the Government.  Ms Joan Carmichael of the IMPACT trade union is working as an independent chair to help staff to make the change.  I welcome the broad support I have received across the sector as I have overseen the transition to the new agency.</p></speech>

She mentioned that the agency will be answerable to its new director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  Will it be directly answerable to the Minister of the day?  Political accountability is crucial in this regard.  I raised this issue when the Minister launched the agency earlier in the summer.  Given that the HSE is disbanding its current governance structure, it is regrettable that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is seeking to develop a similar structure in this instance.  The Minister has said that the new agency will have a budget of approximately â¬590 million per annum.  Will the new agency start with a clean bill of health?  I hope that a deficit will not have to be carried by the new agency as it begins its work.  That would not be a welcome move.</p></speech>

The Government has yet to make a decision on the exact model of governance for the agency.  Obviously, that will form part of the legislation, which will be brought to the DÃ¡il before December.  The Deputy will be aware that the task force which examined the various forms of governance in operation among international child protection services was strongly of the view that the agency should have an independent board, especially in light of the nature of its child protection work.  I have not made a decision on that yet.  The agency will certainly be accountable to me as Minister.  Of course there will be political accountability.  The Deputy also asked about the starting budget.  I hope the agency will start its work in a strong budgetary position.  We are all familiar with the economic situation and the financial pressures that are faced by all services at present.  Members will appreciate that there are big demands on these services.  The HSE child and family budget and my Department's budget both increased last year.  I hope the agency will start its work in a strong budgetary position.  I will work to that end.</p></speech>

If it forms such a view, it is required to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.  Under the 1995 child care regulations , the HSE is required to consider a child's need for assistance, in accordance with the provisions of section 45, two years prior to the child leaving care.  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.</p><p>The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years on the basis of a need for assistance.</p><p><br /> As I have previously advised the Deputy, regular statistics for young adults in receipt of aftercare only commenced being compiled and published by the HSE after I took office in 2011.  I am now receiving quarterly reports on the numbers leaving aftercare; therefore, we now have more up-to-date figures than were previously available.  I believe I supplied the Deputy with figures for the years 2007 to 2010, inclusive.  As of June 2012, the statistics indicate that 1,053 young adults were in receipt of an aftercare service.  As I told the Deputy previously, the budgets for aftercare provision across the country have increased substantially.  While regular figures were not available before 2011, we are aware that the number of children in aftercare has increased, for example, from 847 in 2009 to 1,053 in June 2012.  I will be getting new figures at the end of September.  I have asked the HSE if it can compile the precise information requested by the Deputy for the seven year period.  Although I do not have that information available today, I will try to get it.  We have given all the data we have available.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p><br /> The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation, as well as further education, employment or training and social support.  The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those who are not in education and training and those who have left residential care.  Young people with mental health problems or a disability are also in need of particular support.  Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance, networks and practical support.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element in achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.</p><p><br /> Some 90% of children in care are in foster care, a large number of whom remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age.  Many of these young people continue in education and training, as planned.  This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care.</p><p><br /> The HSE national aftercare service is underpinned by a national policy and procedures document which has been developed in co-operation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department.  The policy which was finalised in April 2011 commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and ensuring consistency of support for these young people.  The HSE has established an intra-agency national aftercare implementation group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.  The work of this group is ongoing and I have asked Mr. Gordon Jeyes, national director for children and family services in the HSE, to prepare a report on aftercare. This report will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the key findings of the group, examples of best practice, assessment criteria and effective aftercare supports.  The report will guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area. </p><p><br /> The Deputy will be aware that I am examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation to make explicit the HSE's obligations in the provision of aftercare.  The experience in implementing the national aftercare policies and procedures and the involvement of a range of important stakeholders in this process provide an opportunity to further improve policy and legislation in this area.</p></reply>

I remain hugely concerned, which is why I continue to raise it with her.  For her information, the last time she responded with figures up to the end of May 2012, the figure was 1,310.  There needs to be a revisitation of the June figure as it could hardly have dropped so dramatically to 1,053.  I am concerned about the process of establishing the figures.</p><p>  Young adults 18 years and older need continuing support, particularly in these harsh economic times.  As a parent of young adults, I am keenly aware of this, as many in this institution will affirm.  As a substitute for birth parents, the State should treat those in our collective care no differently, which would be my certain wish.  We must continue to protect vulnerable young people and our duty of care does not cease on their attaining their 18th birthday.</p><p>  With all that has been exposed in recent reports, by which we are all deeply shocked, it is vital - I remake the case - to ensure a legal right to aftercare is included in the Statute Book to avoid future tragedies.  The Child Care Act, as it stands, could be described as a hollow guarantee without including this legal right.  There must be investment to ensure there will be sufficient resources in place to provide aftercare for all young people who require it.</p><p>  I understand from previous responses that the Minister indicated ten additional dedicated aftercare workers would be recruited.  Has she filled these additional posts yet?  I understand there were already 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE.  Does the Minister accept the HSE's indication that aftercare must be provided according to needs and based on a needs assessment?  Will she indicate how child or young adult friendly is this assessment?  Are all young people being assessed post-care?</p></speech>

I share his view of the vulnerability of young people leaving care.  We had the figure in 2010 of 2,000 young people leaving care.  There is no question that there have been developments since, although I am not complacent about the matter.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on the number of aftercare staff who have been recruited, but it is my understanding the recruitment did go ahead.  I will confirm this for the Deputy.</p><p>  There is now a national policy on aftercare, as the Deputy knows, and there has also been the very positive development of the establishment of the intra-agency national aftercare implementation group, of which EPIC, the group which works with young people to ensure their perspectives are taken into account, is part.  The HSE has issued a directive that young people due to leave care be assessed.</p><p>  I also said I would examine the legislation.  When I bring forward the legislation to establish the new agency, I hope to bring forward within it a more explicit statement of the HSE's obligation in regard to aftercare.  As the Deputy knows, my advice from the Attorney General, as well as my legal advice, has been that there is already a statutory obligation, but I will make it more explicit in view of the seriousness and importance of the issue.  I expect to be able to include this in the legislation establishing the new agency in order that it will be very clear that it has the responsibility  I will revert to the Deputy with the figures sought.</p></speech>

To what extent is she prepared to move in terms of the new legislative provision?  There are 100 young people leaving aftercare on an annual basis - perhaps the figure is even greater than this - and the number will continue to rise as more and more are catered for within the care system.  Greater resources will be required into the future and it is essential we put them in place.  Again, on the basis of the equality core value, those of us who are parents know that young adults continue to require our support.  We should continue to treat children in our care no differently.</p></speech>

There has clearly been a change in terms of the awareness of the needs of this group.  Of course, it is important to point out that not every young person leaving care will be in need of aftercare.  Some will obviously not want it or will just want to do their own thing and move on.  There will also be quite a number of young people in the care system who will turn 18 and remain with foster families.</p><p>  The Deputy's question points to the need for even more careful analysis of the figures.  As I said - this is an issue I have had to confront across a number of areas - we need better quality information on precisely what is happening to young people who leave the care system.  We are beginning to get this information.  We are also beginning to see increased budgets and provision.  Given the vulnerability of some young people in aftercare, as we saw in recent reports, we have to ensure we provide the very best quality service we can in order to help them make that transition from care.</p></speech>

My Department works in close partnership with other Departments on a range of cross-cutting issues in regard to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people.  I also point to the fact that my Department is in the process of developing a new children and young people's policy framework and that it is intended this overarching policy document will provide a seamless, whole-of-childhood approach to policy-making, including budgetary decision-making, for children and young people across the whole of government in the period 2013-18.</p><p>  As regards the published 2012 Estimates for my Department, the Deputy might note that the full gross allocation for 2012 stands at just under â¬427 million, of which â¬418 million relates to current funding and the remainder to capital funding.  Given the number of key priorities facing my Department which include establishing the new Child and Family Support Agency, holding a constitutional referendum on children's rights and the continued provision of the free preschool year in early childhood care and education, the resource allocation represents a 2% increase in funding when compared to the Estimates outturn of â¬419 million for 2011.</p><p>That shows the priority attached to the delivery of the programmes which come under my own Department.  I was very pleased to obtain capital funding of â¬6 million towards child care this year.  The Deputy will also be aware of the money that has been agreed and given by the Government so that we can take children out of St. Patrick's Institution.  The capital fund for that is quite substantial.</p><p> With regard to my own direct remit, the Deputy will be aware of the child and family support programme, which includes funding for the Family Support Agency, the National Education Welfare Board, the school completion programme and child detention centres.  With regard to early childhood, we have the free preschool year, and we also support a range of programmes including the national longitudinal study of children in Ireland, the national children's strategy, the lottery funding scheme, provision for the Ombudsman for Children, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the constitutional referendum on children's rights, which will take place next month.  That summarises the range of resources in my Department.</p></reply>

I am trying to work out the wider departmental position and do not want to engage in a debate about the budget itself.  Every time I wish to pose a question I must ask myself whether it should be directed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills or some other Minister.  Children are represented in almost every single Department.</p><p>  In terms of children's issues, we are seeing things pushed to the limit and we have measurement by failure.  Recently I have been made aware of a transport problem at St. Raphael's special school, the removal of the dental service for primary school children in my constituency and the fact that developmental clinics for babies are being seriously cut back, to give but a few examples.  During last week's debate about the Department of Health, the filling of vacant positions in areas such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy was raised.  There may well be two priorities in that Department but children are the big losers due to the lack of such services.</p><p>  I am trying to understand whether the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs sits at the Cabinet table as an advocate.  Does she analyse what each Department is doing from the point of view of children?  Does she examine the failures that occur, such as the curtailing of developmental clinics for babies, which is pretty serious?  What approach does the Minister take where she sees such failures, and is there a proactive approach on the delivery side?</p></speech>

Another way of looking at that is to ask how we should organise our services so that we get the best delivery for children.  If the Deputy has not read the task force report on child and family services and how they should operate under the new agency, I would recommend that she do so.  The report argues that the way we organise our services is not as friendly to children and families as it needs to be.  It recommends that we try to deliver services to customers in a customer-friendly way so that they can readily access the services they need.  There is an issue with regard to the structural organisation of some of our services.</p><p>  In response to the point raised by the Deputy, there is clearly a whole-of-government responsibility to children.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have very specific responsibilities in the areas I outlined earlier, but some issues are cross-departmental.  The issue of developmental clinics referred to by the Deputy, for example,  is something about which I would be very concerned.  As a member of the Government, I share in the collective responsibility when it comes to making decisions on budgetary matters and matters that affect children.  I am engaged in detailed discussions with other Cabinet colleagues, through Cabinet sub-committees and through quite a number of inter-departmental working groups on an ongoing basis to ensure better delivery of services.  I am also engaged in regular bilateral meetings, such as those currently taking place with the Department of Social Protection on child care services.   </p><p>  There are two answers to the Deputy's question.  One relates to how we actually deliver the services at present, what Departments they are organised under and how seamless the services should be.  The second relates to the fact that there is a whole-of-government responsibility in terms of child-proofing policies and decisions.  The concept of equality-proofing was accepted some time ago but that still has a long way to go.  The Government must be sensitive to the cumulative impact of decisions on children and families.  I have a particular responsibility to interact with other Ministers in that context.</p></speech>

It is more reflective of the fact that children have an entitlement to services.  Will the Child and Family Support Agency be responsible to the Minister in the same way that the HSE is responsible to the Minister for Health?  It will be very difficult to maintain proper scrutiny if the agency is at arms length or outsourced, so to speak.  As members of the Opposition we are supposed to hold the Government to account but, in the case of the HSE, for example, it is really difficult for us to figure out how services are run.  It can take ages to receive replies to questions and so forth.  How does the Minister anticipate the agency will work?  That will be critical if we are to move towards a different model of service delivery.</p></speech>

The governance of the new agency will form part of that legislation when it is presented for debate before December.  The Government has yet to take some decisions regarding the new agency.  In response to the question of accountability that the Deputy raises, it will be far easier to achieve accountability with an agency that is dedicated to this area with a sole focus, as opposed to being part of a large organisation such as the HSE.  In the latter organisation, managers have multiple jobs and multiple focuses.  As I said in an earlier reply, we have reduced the number of managers from 34 to 16 and there is much clearer accountability.  It is much closer from the front line to management.  Gordon Jeyes has made the point repeatedly that accountability is essential.  There will be clearer political and front-line accountability because we will not have several layers of management in the new agency.  The governance structure will form part of the legislation that I will bring before the House in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

International evidence shows that early intervention can improve outcomes for children and families, particularly with regard to emotional, cognitive and social development.  However, child care takes many forms, consisting not only of early years interventions but also of services such as after-school care for school-aged children.  Child care is used by families in many different ways.</p><p>  With the exception of a small number of nurseries subsidised by the HSE and preschools funded by the Department of Education and Skills, the State does not operate child care and play school services.  Child care services are generally operated as either commercial or community not-for-profit concerns.  Child care costs are dictated by the costs for service providers and by the market.  According to a survey of child care providers carried out by Pobal in 2011, the average cost of a full-time child care place is â¬165 per week, with the cost of a place for a younger baby approximately â¬10 above that.  However, prices vary across the country.  </p><p>  I appreciate the point the Deputy makes that child care costs continue to be a significant challenge and burden for many families.</p><p>I also appreciate that the child care costs for parents in this country are high relative to other countries.  That has been commented upon in various reports in the past decade, including by the OECD.  The Government does support a number of child care programmes through the provision of the three separate child care support programmes: the community childcare subvention, CCS, programme.  I have seen examples all around the country of the support the programme gives to local families in the community: the childcare education and training support, CETS, scheme which helps where parents are involved in education and training, and the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme which funds the universal free preschool year.  These programmes are administered by my Department.</p><p><br /> We are lucky to have 94% of young children who are eligible benefitting from the universal free preschool year, which is available to all three to four year olds in the country.  I commend the work of my predecessor in introducing the scheme when the early child care payment was abolished by the previous Government.</p><p><i> Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>Protecting and, if possible, further developing the universal free preschool scheme has been a key priority for me and the Department.  In last December&#8217;s budget I secured an additional &#8364;9.8 million in funding to maintain the universal free year which has seen an increase of approximately 3,000 in the number of children participating in the programme.  In 2012, the total expenditure by my Department on the three child care programmes is expected to exceed &#8364;240 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and these schemes represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of child care.</p></reply>

She cannot simply wash her hands and say markets dictate the cost of child care.  It is too big an issue.  The Minister correctly outlined the various figures that have been bandied about on the cost of child care.  It costs up to â¬1,100 a month in parts of Dublin for child care.  The cost is restricting the ability of people to return to the workplace.  It is more expensive than the average monthly mortgage and something must be done about it.  A significant amount of money was invested in community child care facilities in recent years.  We should consider providing more community facilities because they provide greater affordability of care.  At the same time community child care facilities are being attacked by the savage cuts to the community employment schemes.  I am a board member of a community child care facility.  Without the community employment scheme workers on the staff it would not be possible to continue in existence.  I urge the Minister to examine the issue seriously.  We must bring about a situation whereby child care in this country is affordable.  The cost of child care in this country is one of the highest in the OECD.  That is not acceptable and something must be done to address it.  The Minister could consider splitting maternity leave between parents.  We must be innovative in how we approach the issue to ensure that we reduce the cost of child care because it is unsustainable.</p></speech>

I have worked over many years to ensure that parents have proper child care available to them.  What has happened in this country in the past ten years is that instead of delivering a universal free service the money was put into, for example, the child care supplement, which was then withdrawn.  A total of â¬1.2 billion was withdrawn from that payment but it was put into the ECCE scheme.  We have tended to focus on direct cash payments to parents rather than developing the kind of service Deputy Troy says ought to exist.  I would like to have seen such a system being developed in recent years but it was not and now parents are paying the price of commercial rates which are very high.  I agree with Deputy Troy that they are like a mortgage for many parents.  I fully understand the situation parents face.  It is extraordinarily difficult for families and makes it extremely difficult for many families who want to avail of those services to combine work and family life.</p><p>  As Deputy Troy indicated, there are 950 community services throughout the country.  They have been built up in recent years and they are participating in the CCS programme all over the country from which 25,000 children benefit, in addition to 90% of three to four year olds.  I would like to see a second ECCE year.  I would like child care to be provided for all children between the ages of three and five before they go to primary school.  I would like to think that when the budgetary situation improves and we are in a position to put more money into child care that will be one of the places it will be invested.</p></speech>

What will she do to tackle it?  She is lucky and honoured enough to be Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  She has the authority to bring about changes.  What are the Minister's plans to ensure change is introduced?  We will support her and bring ideas to her.</p></speech>

I also ensured that we can continue to provide the community childcare subvention programme and the CETS programme which assist parents in education and training.  As the budgetary situation improves and finance becomes available it is one of the areas on which I would like to focus.  Currently, I am keen to ensure we maintain the current range of services.  That is why I was pleased that the budget in my Department and the part of the HSE budget that deals with child and family support services were increased by 4% at a time when many Departments face huge cutbacks.</p><p>  It is expensive for the State to provide child care.  I wish it was possible for us to do more at the moment but I want to maintain what we have and focus on quality because that matters as well in terms of the delivery of services.  We must continually examine the quality of schemes and the inspection regime.  A range of areas require attention and I am currently focused on them.</p></speech>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  A total of 6,259 children were in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care.</p><p><br />  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.  The care needs of those young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within this country.  For this small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion and in exceptional cases required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and highly specialised therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not available in this country.  This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  The HSE has a national protocol in place for such children.</p><p><br />  The HSE has advised me that as of 21 September 2012, eight young people were detained in out-of-State secure placements.  Four young people are in St. Andrews, Northampton at a cost of &#8364;12,582 per week, per child; two young people are placed in Kibble, a specialist facility in Scotland, at a cost of &#8364;6,685 per week, per child; and two young people are placed in Boystown Nebraska at a cost of &#8364;2,017 per week, per child.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>The HSE ensures that these placements are suitable.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and monitored by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in the specialised units.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's national director for children and family services and my officials.</p></reply>

One of the elements in my question was to inquire about her plans to ensure that children with special care needs receive care within the State.  On the previous occasion we addressed the issue the Minister said on the record - she laid emphasis on it - "that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system."  I am concerned that such referral has become an established feature of the system.  This is an important issue.  The Minister indicated that a small number of children are affected but the cost factor week-on-week is substantial.  Do the figures the Minister cited take into account the cost of facilitating family visits and social worker visits from this jurisdiction to each of the placed children?</p><p>Does that happen?  How long have the small number of young people been in this care and what is the long-term plan for them?  These are young people but what about their further care in life as they grow older?  Has the Minister examined the cost of providing treatment here for that particular cohort of young people?  Has there been any exploration in conjunction with authorities north of the Border to examine the greater viability of providing these specialist care supports to children on a North-South basis on the island of Ireland, thereby eliminating the expensive costs of flights and all the other ancillary costs that must accrue as a result of their being placed on the neighbouring island of Britain, or as in two of the cases cited by the Minister, in the United States?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.757" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600026#Y00200"><p>We accept that on occasion we must send children abroad for highly specialised care in medically complex cases, for example to Great Ormond Street Hospital, because it and others are global centres of excellence.  Other countries also send children there.  We must accept that for children with highly complex and challenging behavioural difficulties sometimes their best possible care can be provided in overseas specialist centres.  That is why we are using these services - we do not have them in this country at present.  We will certainly have looked to see if such services were available any place on the island; that would have been taken into account.  These services would have been chosen very carefully for the children involved.  Given there is such a small number of children involved, I do not wish to say anything that would identify them but suffice it to say that there are very complex care and behavioural needs involved, including emotional and sexual difficulties, and these children need very specialised care.</p><p>  That said, I have indicated previously in the House that I believe our special care facilities, high support units and detention services in this country represent an area that needs attention.  We need more clarity in regard to how this care should develop in the future.  I have met with the relevant people and have an examination under way at present of how we are organising those services because I am not satisfied with the organisation or national planning in their regard.  I believe the people on the front line are doing a very good job, as well as they can do it, but in terms of policy direction and future development of those services the work has simply not been done and it needs to be done.  We have to see the referral of those children in that context.  We do not have the services for them in this country.  Perhaps for some of them we will be able to provide those services in the future.</p><p> I assure the Deputy the costs are per week in the unit so this does not include the various observations he made in regard to other costs.   I assure him also that the social workers are in contact with those children and the services are in constant contact with the providers.  We have experience of children doing extremely well in these units, and returning back to Ireland and doing well, either independently or with their families.</p></speech>

Rather we are talking about particular care settings in regard to very complex cases.  It is not just about specific procedures.  The instances the Minister cited are placements for care needs and supports that are not currently within our system.  Has any serious assessment has been given, even a rough, off the top of the head kind, of the total costs, apart from those of family visits?  The Minister has not clarified whether social workers from this jurisdiction visit these children in their overseas placements.  One is talking about in the order of in excess of â¬400,000 per annum for some of those individual children, which is substantial money.  Will she clarify whether an assessment has been done as to the potential of providing that care support on the island of Ireland?  We might not be talking about eight cases but a smaller number, and perhaps collectively we might be able to ensure those facilities here,  which would be more easily accessible to families and all others who have a role to play.</p></speech>

What these young people are receiving is not simply residential care.  The reason I compared it to Great Ormond Street is that they are getting the kind of treatments and care and psychological interventions that are simply not available to them here.  I assure the Deputy the social workers are in contact with the children and do visit them.  The reason these services are being used is that, having assessed what is available in Ireland, the kind of specialist help these young people need, in the residential care settings such as they are being sent to, is just not available here.  I assure the Deputy that as part of my work in regard to high support and special care, the question of whatever specialist services we can provide in Ireland will clearly form part of that.  Right now, however, we do not have these services in the country.</p></speech>

When the third optional protocol to the convention was opened for signature by member states in February 2012, I announced that it was my intention to sign the protocol on behalf of Ireland as soon as possible.  My Department is currently finalising the State&#8217;s combined third and fourth reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and a full update on the position in regard to the signature of the protocol will be given in that report.  This is the first report to be submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in over five years.</p><p><br />  Due to the wide-ranging nature of the convention it has been necessary to consult with all Departments in regard to both the preparation of the new report as well as the new optional protocol.  This is to enable full consideration to be given to the implications of signature.  Once the report is finalised and submitted to the UN committee it would be my intention to sign the third optional protocol in due course on behalf of Ireland.  Ratification would generally take place some time after that, once the State is satisfied that the necessary legislative and administrative procedures are in place to enable full compliance.  This matter will be assessed by the legal unit of my Department in due course.</p><p><br />  Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the second optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and it is my stated intention to progress to ratification in due course, once I am satisfied that the State will be able to meet all its obligations therein.  I recently discussed the issue of ratification of this protocol in a meeting with the UN special representative on violence against children, which took place in my Department on 11 June last, during the special representative's official visit to Ireland.  We agreed that the matter would be prioritised in due course following completion of my Department<font color="#FF0000">&#8217;</font>s current work on the upcoming children's referendum, the submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p><p><br />  Many of the criminal law provisions of the optional protocol to the Convention have already been implemented in existing domestic legislation.  Legislative proposals that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring to Government in the coming months will, I understand, facilitate compliance with the criminal law requirements of the optional protocol and other international related legal instruments.  It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, it is proposed to ratify the optional protocol and related international legal instruments as soon as is practicable.  It would be my intention in due course to bring a joint memorandum to Government, with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to enable Ireland to ratify the second optional protocol, which has been signed by Ireland.</p></reply>

In explanation, the communications protocol gives an assurance policy, so to speak, for children.  In the short space of time the Minister has been in office, she and her Department has been doing a great deal to wipe away the history we have had of neglect of children.  However, there may come a time in the future history of our State where we will once again neglect children and their rights.  This protocol gives an international insurance policy for children and their advocates to appeal to the United Nations and have those rights vindicated.</p><p>We have not yet signed it.  The Minister has stated clearly to the House that she intends to sign it, which is to be welcomed, but the question is on the time line.  I understand she is in a particularly busy period and the amount of legislation she is dealing with is impressive.  The children's rights referendum is coming up.  Hers is a particularly busy Department and it is also a fairly new one, but the signing of the protocol would mean a great deal in that we would be meeting not just our domestic obligations to children but our obligations on the international stage also.  We now have a chance, given the way children have been treated in the past, to be a shining light internationally.  The signing of the protocol as soon as we possibly can would ensure this.  Can the Minister give a specific time line in that regard and also for ratification of the second one about which I have asked?</p></speech>

It is on our agenda.  We intend to ratify the second protocol as quickly as we can and move to the third one.  I would think we will be in a position to do this in the coming months.  On the second protocol, I am waiting for some legislation on which the Department of Justice and Equality is working.  I will bring a memorandum to the Government on it with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Further legislation is being prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality to strengthen the protection of children from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and facilitate full compliance with the relevant international legal instruments.  Once that is done, it should clear the way for ratification of the second protocol.  As regards the third one, I will be working on the report on the rights of the child shortly.  An amount of work is being done on it in my Department and I am aware it requires that we liaise with other Departments to get their responses to what is included in the protocol.</p></speech>

I did not get to make a number of points in reply on the back-drop to the establishment of the agency and the other issues we need to pursue as we establish it.  One I have mentioned is the consistency of the child protection services in that the assessments and responses families receive will be similar throughout the country.  Another back-drop includes the legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis, the provision of a dedicated budget for the child and family support agency and the transition of the child protection and welfare services to the new agency.  The Family Support Agency will merge with the new agency and its budget of â¬26 million will form part of the budget of the child and family support agency.</p></reply>

The Minister stated in her earlier reply that the core services would be transferred by January 2013.  In correspondence to me she might indicate the core services that are to be transferred and indicate a timeframe for the transfer of the remaining services.  It is welcome that the governance structure has not been fully agreed to by the Government and that we will have an opportunity to debate it as the legislation proceeds through the House.</p><p>  The Minister has said she hopes the agency will start with a strong budget.  I hope, given that it will be a new agency, that it will not start with a deficit.  This is a new agency which will do good work and there should not be an overhang in its budget, as it did not have an opportunity to exert influence heretofore.</p></speech>

We will have an opportunity to discuss that issue when I bring the legislation to the House.</p><p><br />  The core services consist of the child and family support services in the Health Service Executive, and the work done by the Family Support Agency and the education and welfare services.  On the areas that must have a strong relationship with the child and family support agency - some of them should be directly under it - I am not sure what the transition point might be for them, but going on the very good work done by the task force we should examine, for example, some public health nursing services that could come directly under the new agency, although not all of them.  I envisage public health nurses remaining where they are at present, but I would like to see strong interaction because many of them have direct contact with families.  Speech and language therapy services, child and adolescent mental health services, Garda youth diversion projects and the psychology services were examined in the task force report.  As I stated in reply to Deputy Murphy, we need to examine the organisation of some of these services and how they can best deliver to the families who need them.</p></speech>

I have every confidence that this is a priority for her, but when does she expect to be in a position to announce an exact date for the commencement of the agency's functions?  In terms of core responsibilities, is it the case that she expects various other roles and responsibilities to be accredited to the agency over a period of time?  Over what period does she expect these roles and responsibilities to be transferred?</p></speech>

I am confident, having spoken to people on the ground, that this will be the case.  In my area there has been a transfer from the HSE.  I also see, however, that in Bishopstown an issue has arisen.  It is important, therefore, that we have a seamless transfer and that there are clear lines of demarcation and responsibility.  This is a great opportunity, about which we should not be negative; rather we should be positive about it.</p></speech>

We will have work to do in the DÃ¡il in advance of that date, but we have said all along that the agency will begin as a separate entity from 1 January 2013.  It should progress, depending on the introduction of legislation in the House and the making of decisions on the governance structure and its development.</p><p> It is clear that the core services to which I referred earlier when replying to Deputy Troy will be transferred to the new agency in the first instance.  I will be bringing a memo to Government in respect of this matter shortly in order that we might discuss the findings and recommendations contained in the report of the task force.  Some of the recommendations have implications in the context of the way in which services are delivered.  As a result of the fact that a number of Departments will be involved, the Government as a whole will be obliged to make a decision on this matter.  There is not yet an exact timeframe with regard to the transfer of some other services.  However, it is important that the services which will be available from the new agency will be those which families need and use and which are of most benefit to them.  It will, of course, be a matter of developing strong links to certain services rather than moving them directly into the agency.  The task force has pointed out that there are certain key services which it is not planned to bring under the remit of the new agency but which ought to be under its direct control.  We will be able to discuss that matter when the legislation is introduced.</p></speech>

This protocol is designed to formalise cross-border information-sharing practice when agencies learn that families of children at risk are moving, or have moved, across the Border, thereby ensuring that children and families moving between the two jurisdictions will receive the care and protection they need in a timely and appropriate manner.  The protocol represents a collaborative approach to best practice, with the aim of allowing the agencies to assess and manage risk in respect of children and families that move into their respective jurisdictions.</p><p>  Information relating to children who are in care, who are on the child protection register or in respect of whom there is a level of concern and who move between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be shared between the statutory authorities in both jurisdictions.  This will allow for a greater focus on those children at risk through enhanced information sharing.  The latter will permit better assessments to be carried out in respect of each specific childâs needs and circumstances.</p><p>  The protocol is available to download from relevant departmental websites.  It represents a very positive and practical outcome from the co-operation on child protection which is overseen by the North-South Ministerial Council and which is being taken forward by my Department and officials in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.  This matter has been on the agenda at quite a number of the meetings of the council at which I have been in attendance.  There has been extremely good co-operation in respect of best practice with regard to information sharing in order to ensure that children at risk will be assisted in an effective manner within both jurisdictions.</p></reply>

I welcome its introduction.  It is extremely important that this practical area of understanding and addressing mutual problems should be part and parcel of normal political life across the island of Ireland.  The protocol is going to be of assistance in terms of building levels of ongoing co-operation between the respective authorities North and South.</p><p>  How will the protocol operate in the context of the establishment of the new child and family support agency, which was the subject of the previous question, on 1 January next?  The protocol is, of course, just a statement of shared intent and outlook in respect of specific issues that present.  Does the potential exist to move on from the protocol and take a further step of co-operation on a new level and not only in respect of matters relating to child protection?  In other words, will it be possible to foster co-operation and information sharing with regard to those who constitute a risk to children?  At present, there is a significant deficiency in the context of the position relating to the Six Counties and that of this State.</p></speech>

The relevant front-line staff are aware of its existence and when families are moving between the two jurisdictions, information sharing is actually taking place.</p><p>  The Deputy's point in respect of the North-South Ministerial Conference and the potential to develop our work in this area is relevant.  We are considering a number of areas in respect of which information can be exchanged.  One of the new work streams relates to examining the death of children in care in both jurisdictions and discovering the lessons we might learn and share in this regard.  We are also considering what constitutes best practice in the context of safeguarding children generally.  The Deputy referred earlier to specialist services and we are examining ways to provide these on a cross-Border basis in order to assist in meeting the needs of children and families in circumstances where a high volume of expertise is required.  That matter is being jointly examined by the authorities in the two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In that regard, research indicates that some 25% of three year olds are either obese or overweight.</p><p>  National play and recreation policies are implemented by local authorities.  Many of the latter have developed world-class recreational facilities and integrated play plans which benefit thousands of children.  I am, from the point of view of my Department's remit, trying to encourage a joined-up approach to the development and use of the extensive range of facilities available throughout the country.  In February I established the first ever national local authority play and recreation network, which brings together key personnel responsible for local authorities' play and recreation policies.  It was extremely interesting to meet staff from the various local authorities and watch them sharing their experiences in the context of developing facilities for children and local communities and learning from each other.  That is the benefit of the network.</p><p>  To date, the network has taken initiatives to promote and expand national play day and national recreation week.  Deputies will be aware that when specific activities are arranged for children and families, thousands of people attend.  I witnessed thousands of families availing of facilities in Corkagh Park in my constituency when a little bit more was done to try to attract them by providing a range of activities in particular weeks.  The network aims to improve co-ordination between local authorities and to provide training and share information in order to facilitate the development of staff expertise.  For example, this year some 25 local authorities participated this year in national play day and the events surrounding it.  This placed a focus on the kind of activities with which families need to be provided.  Plans in train for national recreation week 2012, which will be held at the end of October.</p></reply>

It is heartening that 25 local authorities have participated in the national play day initiative.  I hope the Minister will make this initiative compulsory in order that all local authorities will become involved with it.  The committee of which Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in and I are members is dealing with the issue of obesity.  In that context, it is imperative to highlight the fact that access to play and recreational facilities, particularly those provided by local authorities, has major benefits from the point of view of promoting healthy lifestyles and developing children's self-esteem and their sense of self-identity.  It also has economic benefits which can help to reduce the State's expenditure on health and ensure that health care facilities will no longer be clogged up with unfit people.</p><p>We have taken a step in the right direction.  It must be incumbent on local authorities and developers to provide play areas in new estates. There needs to be a joined up approach.  This is a very important piece of work which will have long-term positive advantages for our nation.</p></speech>

There is now a much greater awareness of the benefits of such facilities on the part of local authorities.  As Deputy Buttimer said, there is a need for joined up thinking on this matter.  There is a need to focus on this area and all Deputies can play a part in this regard by highlighting why these services and facilities are so essential for children and families.  Local authorities have an important role in providing these facilities.</p><p>  The establishment of the network has been important because some local authorities are doing more than others.  There is certainly room for a national initiative to develop this kind of play and recreational facilities.  Deputy Buttimer is a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and he will be aware of the research on the serious health problems of very young children.  We need to ensure a variety of interventions are in place to interrupt that trend.  If not, there will be significant implications for the national health policy and for the children themselves.</p></speech>

However, will the Minister agree that it was a significant error that during the boom times we did not make it mandatory for local authorities and developers when they were creating vast estates in urban Ireland in particular not to include playgrounds and recreational facilities as part of any development?  We allowed developers to run amok in parts of Cork city and Dublin city.  They did not acknowledge the need for facilities to allow for recreation and leisure and to promote the health and well-being of the residents.  Even at this time of economic recession when developers are not as plentiful as they were, I hope the Minister and her colleagues in government will learn from the mistakes of the past and make plans to provide a healthy lifestyle for all our citizens.</p></speech>

This is a pilot project for assessing and improving physical fitness among Irish primary school students and also the Department of Education and Skills' active school flag programme, which is the promotion of physical fitness in Irish primary and secondary schools.  I have seen in schools in my local area the value of that programme.  Schools win flags for environmental initiatives but this is an initiative to encourage greater physical activity among schoolchildren.  The active school flag campaign is a positive initiative on the part of the Department of Education and Skills.  More schools throughout the country are becoming involved in the programme.  I also refer to SÃºgradh Ireland which is a registered charitable organisation.  Research shows that Irish families are becoming involved in sporting activities because they realise the importance of such activities for the health of their children.</p></speech>

I welcomed the statement by the Minister, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn, of his intention to look at the issue of patronage for the primary sector.  I thought it was high time that someone got to grips with this issue as I believe the great mix and diversity, which makes up Irish society, is not currently reflected in our school system.  Educate Together is a relatively recent addition to the short list of patron bodies to govern our schools.  However, it is one that has gone from strength to strength since the first school - the Dalkey School Project - was established in Dalkey in the late 1970s.  There have been 65 schools brought into operation across the country under the ethos of Educate Together and I understand more primary schools are to open this year and next year.  Five of these schools are within the north Wicklow and DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  They include schools in Wicklow town, Greystones, Dalkey, Monkstown and in my home town of Bray.  However, there is a problem as these students cannot progress to a nearby Educate Together secondary school as there is none in existence.  </p><p>  At the beginning of his term as Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn took the important step of recognising Educate Together as a patron body for second-level schools.  This commitment is welcome and I do not underestimate the significance of this recognition, given that a new second-level patronage body has not been recognised by the State since the 1930s.  When the Minister announced the new school builds to meet our growing population I was hopeful that the school at the Blacklion site in Greystones would be among the first second-level schools to attain Educate Together recognition.  This was not to be, however, although I know that sites in Drogheda, Blanchardstown and Lucan did attain this patronage.  I know that good campaigns by parents were run on behalf of the interested patron bodies for the Greystones site, but ultimately the Church of Ireland was selected as patron.  While I wish the school all the very best and I congratulate the parents and staff who are to embark on setting up this exciting project, a problem remains.  The five Educate Together primary schools to which I referred earlier, still have no secondary school nearby to which parents can send their children.  It is clear that this facility should be made available.</p><p>  Research undertaken by Trinity College Dublin, demonstrated that over 90% of parents whose children attend Educate Together primary schools would send them to an Educate Together second-level school if such were available.  This research is clearly reflected in the number of parents who wish to gain patronage at the Blacklion site in Greystones, with a total of 1,440 expressions of interest for such patronage.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that the VEC school in Kilcoole is over-subscribed from its own catchment area and that there is no viable multidenominational option for students in the Bray-Greystones area.</p><p>  Concerns have also been expressed to me that multidenominational admission policy does not adequately address the requirement for full equality and parity of esteem for students of all beliefs.  Therefore, the question arises as to what provision will be made by the Department to meet the needs of parents and families looking for a nearby second-level Educate Together school in the Wicklow-south Dublin area.</p></speech>

As Deputy Ferris will be aware, the Minister announced in June of last year that up to the year 2016 a total of 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools are to be established across a number of locations, to cater for our increased pupil numbers.  Included in that announcement is a new post-primary school planned for Greystones in County Wicklow and which is scheduled to commence in September 2014.  The Minister also announced new criteria and arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and second-level schools.  The new arrangements published by my Department include the establishment of a new schools establishment group, an independent advisory group to advise him on the patronage of the new schools following its consideration of a report prepared by departmental officials.</p><p>These new arrangements provide a balanced approach in allowing applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools.  The criteria to be applied in respect of patronage decisions place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.  In accordance with the application and patron selection process put in place by the Department, an invitation for applications for patronage of the new post-primary schools issued in July 2011.  The closing date for receipt of applications from prospective patrons, having been extended to accommodate the possible submission of joint patronage applications, was 13 January 2012.</p><p> Applications for patronage of the new post-primary school in Greystones were received from Church of Ireland, Educate Together and County Wicklow VEC.  All the applicant patron bodies proposed to establish multidenominational schools in response to parental wishes.  There is only one post-primary school in the Greystones feeder area, namely, St. David's Holy Faith school, an English-medium Catholic school under the patronage of the Holy Faith Sisters.  The provision of a multidenominational school would serve to increase the diversity of school provision and broaden parental choice in the area.  All applicants agreed to comply with the relevant requirements set out by the Department and submitted very comprehensive applications.  All were assessed in line with the published criteria which clearly state patron bodies proposing schools will be asked to provide evidence of parental demand.  There was a considerable difference in expressed demand as between the different applications.   All other matters being equal, on the basis of parental demand, the recommendation was that patronage of the new school in Greystones be awarded to the Church of Ireland.</p><p> Departmental officials submitted a report to the new schools advisory committee in June 2012 for its consideration and a further submission to the Minister for consideration and final decision.  On 25 July the Minister announced his decisions on the patronage of 14 new post-primary schools to be established in 2013 and 2014.  The combination of the existing provision and the establishment of a new multidenominational post-primary school in the Greystones area will cater for the needs of all pupils in the area.  My Department will continue to monitor enrolments in the area to ensure there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected future demands.  Such is the scale of the projected growth in our post-primary pupil population that the Minister expects there will be a need to establish more new schools to meet the future demand for additional pupil places post-2016.  The area referred to by the Deputy is one of several areas of population growth under consideration in this context.  When the locations where further new schools will be provided are finalised and announced during 2013, it will be open to patron bodies, including Educate Together, to make an application for patronage in respect of any of them.</p></speech>

Educate Together will continue its campaign for a new secondary school to service the larger area to which I referred.  As I said, there are five primary schools under the patronage of that body in the Wicklow-DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  In most cases, the parents of the children attending these schools would like them to be able to avail of an Educate Together secondary education, either in County Wicklow or south Dublin.  The demand for Educate Together schools at both primary and secondary level continues to grow.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy RuairÃ­ Quinn's engagement on the issue of school patronage and the decision to nominate Educate Together as a patron for secondary schools.  However, there are many parents in County Wicklow who are very disappointed that their children cannot progress to a secondary school of the same ethos within their area.  There is a significant urgency to this issue as the children currently in Educate Together primary schools progress through the system.  I will convey the Minister of State's response to the parents concerned and advise them to contact the Department when the new round of schools is announced.</p></speech>

As in County Wicklow, there is a significant number of Educate Together primary schools in County Galway.  As those children move through the primary school system, I fully expect parental demand for a post-primary option to increase.  As I said, another round of new school announcements is expected in response to the very serious democratic challenges arising in the school system.  I have every confidence that Educate Together will feature in these announcements, if parental demand is sufficient.  The statistics certainly suggest we can expect to see a significant number of secondary schools opening throughout the country under the patronage of Educate Together.</p></speech>

The statement last night by the Finance Ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland can only be seen as a major setback to the efforts to secure an overall deal on this country's bank debt.   It is all very fine for the Taoiseach to insist that the summit statement from last June still stands, but that is no good to Ireland unless it is implemented.  The bottom line is that the June summit agreement will not be implemented without the support of the Germans, Dutch and Finns.  That is why we must treat last night's statement with extreme seriousness.</p><p>  The noises coming from Berlin, in particular, have not been favourable for some time.  Last month the German Finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, indicated that Germany would oppose any Irish debt-relief proposal which would, in its view, send a negative signal to financial markets.  Earlier this month the Chancellor, Mrs. Angela Merkel, expressed the view that Ireland was on a good path to recovery and she saw no need for changes to the bailout programme.  If the statement issued by the three Finance Ministers last night accurately reflects the current views of the German, Dutch and Finnish Governments, it is devastating news for Ireland.  A failure to do a deal on bank debt changes everything.  Such a failure jeopardises our ability to exit the bailout and return to the markets.  It means tougher budgets in the years ahead.  Above all, it means that Ireland's debt position will become unsustainable in the absence of economic growth.</p><p>  The statement sets out the position that direct European Stability Mechanism, ESM, recapitalisation can only take place once the &quot;single supervisory mechanism is established and its effectiveness has been determined&quot;.  Although we more or less knew this to be the case, it underlines the fact that a timely deal is unlikely.  The statement indicates that while the ESM may take direct responsibility for problems that occur under the new supervision regime, legacy assets should remain the responsibility of national authorities.  That is the key issue, as well as the stipulation that recapitalisation should occur using estimated real economic values.  In other words, there will be no free lunch from the ESM.</p><p>  What most concerns me is the impression among our European colleagues that everything is fine in this country, that we are back in the markets, meeting all the requirements under the bailout programme and ticking all the boxes.  We must offer our colleagues a more honest assessment of where we are at.  Such an assessment would acknowledge that day-to-day life for many Irish people is miserable because of the prevailing economic conditions.  Without a deal on bank debt, the prospects for recovery will be nowhere near as favourable as they could be.  That is the bottom line.</p><p>  Last March the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, while on a visit to the United States, said that if the world economy were to pick up, the Irish economy would take off like a rocket.  Unfortunately, the world economy has not revived and the Irish economy has not taken off like a rocket.  In fact, the domestic economy continues to shrink.  I am all for speaking positively about the economy, but all such talk must be grounded in reality.  In May the Minister told a Bloomberg economic summit that the economy was in a much better position now than it was last year.  That is not borne out by the statistics for unemployment, emigration, projected economic growth and tax receipts.  In recent months, for example, tax receipts have been  below what they were in the same period last year.</p><p>  Will the Minister give his honest response to what was said last night?  Is he disappointed by it?  Where does it leave us in terms of negotiating and securing an overall deal on bank debt?  I accept that he is genuinely seeking to secure such a deal, as evidenced by his travels to the various European capitals to meet his ministerial counterparts.  However, we must call a spade a spade and acknowledge that last night's statement is a major setback.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's honest assessment of the situation.</p></speech>

The Deputy should speak with a certain amount of modesty because all of the renegotiation being conducted by the Government on the bailout programme amounts to a series of attempts to unwind the deal made by the Fianna FÃ¡il-led Government which got us into difficulty in the first instance.  It made all the arrangements for the bailout and recapitalisation of the banks which we are now trying to unwind.  There is also a danger that the Deputy will fall into the Sinn FÃ©in trap-----</p></speech>

The statement addresses issues already decided upon by eurozone leaders when they met in Brussels on 29 June.  As the Taoiseach set out this morning, the Heads of State and Government made two important decisions on 29 June, the first of which was to &quot;affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.&quot;  The second, which related specifically to Ireland, was the following: <blockquote>The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  Similar cases will be treated equally.</blockquote>I emphasise the reference to equal treatment.</p><p><br />  Since that date, work has been proceeding on both of these elements.  Officials from my Department have travelled to several capitals.  I travelled to Paris, Berlin, Rome and on to the informal ECOFIN meeting in Cyprus two weeks ago, during which I had constructive talks with my colleagues.  The Taoiseach met with several colleagues last week in Rome and all agreed that the imperative is to move ahead urgently to implement all of the important decisions taken on 29 June.  I also draw the attention of the House to comments from the European Commission this morning, which set out that the agreement of 29 June was clear regarding the European Stability Mechanism and breaking the &quot;vicious cycle&quot; between sovereign and banking debt.</p><p><br />  We are engaged in a diplomatic offensive to implement the decision of 29<sup></sup>June to break the link between banks and the sovereign and enhance the sustainability of our debt.  I acknowledge that the three Ministers and their officials whom I met in their capitals, as well as other EU finance Ministers, have been helpful in moving forward the technical discussions with the troika, namely, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, on the banking debt issue in respect of Irish needs.</p><p><br />  It is in the nature of EU business that differences of interpretation may arise.  However, one thing is clear - the principle of breaking the link between sovereigns and banks has been agreed by the Heads of State and Government.  No one has questioned this.  That being so, our ambassadors in the relevant capitals and senior officials in Dublin are today urgently making contact to follow up on developments.</p><p><br />  This morning, a number of Deputies were disingenuous in attributing statements to my Department.  As those who read the statement from the three finance Ministers will have seen, they made reference to the recent positive reviews of the Irish and Portuguese EU-IMF programmes, which is welcome.  The strong implementation of reforms is one of the reasons Ireland's global reputation has improved so significantly and has led to record levels of foreign investment in the State.  The Government is committed to restoring confidence at home and internationally and the recognition by the three Ministers of the sacrifices that the Irish people have made should be welcomed.</p><p><br />  Ireland will be fully engaged in the process by the euro group and Heads of State and Government on how this will happen.  In putting forward our ideas, we must be conscious that other member states will also put forward their proposals.  However, as was pointed out by the Taoiseach this morning and my Department yesterday afternoon, Ireland's position is clear in this regard.  Work is continuing in line with the summit agreement of 29 June to break the link between banks and sovereigns and on the principle that similar cases will be treated equally.  As I stated, the European Commission reinforced this point this morning.</p><p><br />  It is worth pointing out that the Taoiseach, the TÃ¡naiste and I, along with ambassadors and senior officials, have been vocal in our view that the vicious cycle between banking and sovereign debt should be broken.  I remind the Deputy of the letter the Taoiseach sent to his fellow leaders earlier this year setting out the Government's position.  We want to continue to work in a constructive spirit to enhance the sustainability of our debt.  We have made strong, solid progress in implementing the terms of our EU-IMF programme and have lived up to all of our commitments.  The financial markets have recognised this, as reflected in the reduction of our bond spreads in recent months.  To be clear, Heads of State and Government made a decision on these issues and we continue to work within that framework to deliver the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>

I will ignore the political swipe he made, which sounds rather tired at this stage, and focus instead on the substance of the issue.  He referred to differences of interpretation.  What we read last night from the finance Ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland was not a new interpretation of the summit statement from the end of June.  The three Ministers rewrote the statement and made fundamental changes which are, without question, to Ireland's disadvantage.  That is the nub of the issue, but the Minister appears to be in denial and gives the impression that last night's statement was not significant.  In fact, it marked a shift in position.  If the statement of the three finance Ministers reflects the views of their respective Governments, it is an extremely serious matter.  Either the Minister does not recognise that or he does not wish to admit it.  I want to have an open and honest debate on the issue.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the reduction in bond spreads in recent months.  This is a positive development and the National Treasury Management Agency has made good progress in this regard.  However, the reduction has been connected in no small part to the summit statement issued at the end of June.  The markets have priced in that Ireland will secure a deal on its banking debt.  This progress will be reversed, as we saw today, if it appears the deal struck at the summit will not be implemented.  The fundamental issue is whether countries will be treated equally.  According to the statement issued last night, countries would not be treated equally for reasons of timing because Ireland has recapitalised its banks whereas countries such as Spain have not yet done so.  We need to address that issue. </p><p>  I ask the Minister to set out what milestones lie ahead.  Where is all of this going?  We know it will take some time to establish the new European banking supervisory body.  What level of engagement is taking place between the Minister and his officials and our European colleagues?  Will he raise the issues referred to in last night's statement directly with his colleagues in the euro group?  Will they be raised at Heads of State and Government level?  Will clarification be provided on whether all Governments remain resolutely committed to the principles enshrined in the statement issued following the June summit?  What action will the Government take in response to last night's statement?</p></speech>

I presume the Deputy saw the statement issued by the European Commission this morning.  I will quote Mr. Olivier Bailly, a Commission spokesman, who stated at a media briefing that eurozone Governments should move "quickly" to break the link between bank troubles and sovereign debt.  The agreement reached in June by eurozone governments was, Mr. Bailly said, "extremely clear" in expressing a determination to sever this tie.  "Our position regarding breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign is very clear," he said. "We already showed our determination that for us, this should be done quickly."  The Commission, speaking for the whole Community rather than three Governments, is setting out the position, which is the position that was in the communiquÃ© issued at the Heads of State and Government meeting on 29 June.</p></speech>

However, there are 27 countries in the European Community and a spokesman for the Commission, which speaks for the Community, stated this morning that the policy remains the same as that outlined at the Heads of State and Government meeting of 29 June.  He also noted that member states should move quickly to implement this policy.  That is the position.</p><p><br />  On the general effect, the Deputy used words to the effect that last night's statement represented a major <i>dÃ©marche </i>by the three countries in question.  The markets are not taking it that way.  Irish bond spreads went out by 20 basis points today.  Given that they can rise by ten or 15 points in a normal day, 20 basis points is not an extreme reaction by the markets.  Spanish bond prices went out by 40 basis points, which is not dramatic for Spain because there is movement every day.  It is not that what was said was irrelevant - it is significant and everything must be taken into account - but in the broader scheme of things, it was a statement issued following a meeting in Helsinki attended by three Finance Ministers.</p><p>Obviously we take note of it and it goes into the mix of negotiation.  However, there are other views.  The view outlined by the Commission is the view expressed by the Taoiseach here this morning.  That is the official position of the Community.  We will see how these matters work out as the weeks go by.  The European decision-making process is always a bit untidy.  Anytime one has to get 27 governments to agree, it never runs in straight lines.  We must take the statement for what it is.  It was made, we know what it contains and one can measure its effect as the days go by.  So far today, it has not dislodged the Commission from restating the position as stated by the European Council on 29 June and the markets have more or less taken it in their stride.  The markets move every day but the movement today was relatively small.</p></speech>

Included is a petition of 25 names representing Meenavanaghan, Cross, The Cloghan and Lemacrossan in an area of east Inishowen besides Quigley's Point.  The demographics of the area show 75% of the community is elderly.  The advice from SAORVIEW is that once the switchover happens on 24 October, these communities will not be capable of receiving television coverage through SAORVIEW.  They have been advised to apply through Saorsat which will take upwards of 12 months to get, as well as an additional â¬170.  I do not believe that is a fair option or solution for the people living in these communities.</p><p>  The local television experts have done their research into the availability of television coverage in these geographical pockets.  The existing mast in the area is not part of the SAORVIEW upgrade.  Even the largest television mast in Buncrana will be no good as an option.  RTE will recommission some of the masts in Glenties and Clonmany, to ensure coverage in these areas.  SAORVIEW is of the opinion that channel 45 from Moville will suffice but I do not believe that will be a feasible option.</p><p>  I do not know what research the Minister's officials have done into this matter at this early stage.  The information the Minister will make available this afternoon may not reassure the communities in question.  Accordingly, will his officials investigate this particular issue in depth?  It may be a micro-issue and could be repeated in other parts.</p><p>  My colleague, Councillor Doherty, believes this is an issue of great concern to the communities in question.  Up to 75% of the population in them are elderly.  From a fairness and community point of view, as well as preventing rural isolation, television is a necessary communication mechanism.  If the Minister does not have an update on the matter today, will he use his offices to research this issue because it concerns a great number of people in east Inishowen?</p></speech>

RTE has built, owns and controls the SAORVIEW TV network and is responsible for its roll-out, coverage and operation.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 which provides that the development of the RTE network is an operational matter for RTE and, therefore, not one in which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a function.</p><p><br />  I have, however, had inquiries made about the coverage in Donegal as raised by Deputy McHugh.  Section 130 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 Act provides that RTE must roll out a national digital TV network to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, the analogue network covers 98% of the population and the SAORVIEW network will also provide 98% population coverage.</p><p><br />  Work has been ongoing right across the country to prepare the transmission sites for the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television.  However, it is impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.  Reasons for this include local topography, for example.  Regarding Donegal, I have been informed by RTE Networks Limited, RTENL, that as well as having ten of the 55 SAORVIEW transmission sites located in county Donegal - Glencolumkill, Aranmore, Glenties, Magheroarty, Fanad, Malin, Moville, Holywell Hill, Letterkenny and Ballybofey - a large part of south County Donegal is covered by the large Truskmore transmission sites on the Sligo-Leitrim border.  As the Deputy correctly stated, the existing mast in the area referred to is not part of the SAORVIEW upgrade.</p><p><br />  Notwithstanding this, SAORVIEW, over the old analogue network coverage in Donegal, will give an improvement in terrestrial availability of 6% for RTE One and RTE Two; an improvement in terrestrial availability of 11% for TG4; and, an improvement in terrestrial availability of 51 % for TV3.  I have also contacted RTENL on the townlands around Quigley's Point.  I have been informed that Quigley's Point and its environs are covered by SAORVIEW from a transmission site located near Ballymacarthur, to the north of Moville.  Further information on coverage is available on the SAORVIEW coverage checker on .</p><p><br />  Furthermore, according to RTENL, the majority of homes in the areas of Meenavanaghan, Cross, The Cloghan and Lemacrossan can avail of SAORVIEW or Saorsat.  The latter is, of course, RTE's free-to-air satellite service which was officially launched earlier this year and is, therefore, already available to homes in the area.  RTE is not obliged to provide this satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  With this satellite service, Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.  Currently, Saorsat provides access to RTE 1, RTE Two, RTE NewsNow, RTE +1, TG4, RTE's Digital Teletext service and a number of digital radio channels.  TV3 has not yet made a decision as to their carriage on the service.</p><p><br />  According to RTENL, the cost differential between a SAORVIEW and Saorsat, including full installation, is in the order of &#8364;100.  Should a home wish to pick up the UK free-to-air, FTA, satellite services, as well as the Irish services, households can opt for a satellite installation that provides access to both.  This option is about &#8364;50 cheaper than a full installation that provides for a combination of SAORVIEW and the UK FTA satellite services.  RTENL has developed an information booklet on Saorsat which is available on <i>www.rtenl.ie</i> .</p><p><br />  Should the Deputy have further questions, I will be happy to pass them to RTENL on his behalf for direct reply.</p></speech>

He has provided options.  Locally, there are concerns and what we are trying to do here is reassure people.  There seem to be options albeit more expensive ones which comes back to the fairness issue.  If this continues to be an issue, I acknowledge there is an option for the Minister to pass it on to RTENL.</p><p>  Sometimes we take for granted certain services.  There is a concern that if Saorsat is not in an area, it could take 12 months to commission.  I welcome the fact the Minister is keeping an open line.  I accept he does not have a direct influence with RTE but at the same time, people do bump into each other and they could highlight an issue.</p><p>  Those from Meenavanaghan, Cross and Lemacrossan who did not get tickets for last Sunday's All-Ireland football final watched it on their old television sets with excellent coverage.</p><p>Like the good people of Kerry, once one all-Ireland final is over, we start thinking about the next one.  I hope they will be in a position to avail of coverage of the all-Ireland final in 12 months time.  I am not predicting who will be in it, but it is important that they have coverage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.832" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600033#FF00600"><p>I wish we could say the same for the people of County Louth, but they have their own bone to pick with the Meath team.</p><p><br />  Earlier this year there was a tragic event off Glandore when five fishermen lost their lives.  Michael Hayes was the skipper of the boat involved.  The bodies of all five fishermen were found, which was a tremendous comfort to their families because at least their lost loved ones had a grave to go to.  That was a major help in the healing process.  In 2006 the <i>Maggie B</i> was lost.  On 10 January 2007 the <i>Pere Charles</i> was lost outside Dunmore East.  The following night the <i>Honeydew II</i> was lost west of Helvick Head.  Nine people in total were lost on these three fishing vessels and no body has ever been recovered.  Like anyone who has lost loved ones, the families live in hope that at some stage the remains will be found and that they will have a grave to which to take their loved ones.</p><p><br />  I understand that more than two years ago some remains, including a skull, were discovered off Helvick Head and that two femur bones were discovered off Hook Head.  They are believed to be the bones of a male between 25 and 30 years old.  Two years ago the Garda chief superintendent in charge in Wexford, John Roche, applied for special funding to carry out a special DNA test on the bones to discover whose they were since the initials test proved inconclusive.  Consideration is now being afforded by the Garda authorities to having a nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted on the remains.  My understanding is that the chief superintendent in Wexford at the time applied for funding to carry out these special tests which it was estimated would cost between &#8364;9,000 and &#8364;12,000 and were to be carried out in Wales.  Regrettably, the Department of Justice and Equality did not make the money available.  All of this was kept under the radar and no one knew anything about it until such time as a detective sergeant retired recently.  There was a report on 3 September on &quot;Six-one news&quot; on the discovery of these bones off Helvick Head and Hook Head and the story became public.  As a result, the families of those whose remains are lost continue to hope some of these remains might be those of one of their loved ones.  Two of the people lost on the <i>Pere Charles</i> outside Dunmore East were members of the Hennessy family.  I know the family well.  There is considerable hope that they will be able to discover some part of the remains of their loved ones.</p><p><br />  I seek an assurance from the Minister of State and the Government that, for the sake of &#8364;9,000 or &#8364;12,000 or whatever it would cost, the State will carry out these tests and that the Department will make the money available in order that we can ascertain whether the parts of a skull and the femur bones discovered have any connection with the people lost on any of the vessels mentioned.  There is dreadful anxiety for loved ones when they know that remains have been found but they do not know whether they are those of their loved ones.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything in his power to try to ensure that at least the families know whether these discoveries have anything to do with their loved ones.</p></speech>

He is aware of the concerns expressed by the Deputy relating to the finding of human remains off the coast of counties Wexford and Waterford.  It is natural that these developments cause renewed sadness and heightened expectations for the families of those who were lost in the sinking of the boats referred to by the Deputy, including the <i>Maggie B</i> in 2006 and the <i>Pere Charles</i> and the <i>Honeydew II</i> in 2007.  We all sympathise with the desire to have some closure and resolution for those who have been sadly bereaved through the loss of loved ones at sea.</p><p><br />  In cases of missing persons, whether at sea or on land, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na do all in its power to assist families and friends of those who have been lost.  Where remains are recovered, either on land or at sea, the question arises of the feasibility of carrying out appropriate tests to help to determine if the remains can be identified.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that inquiries to establish the identity of the human remains found have not yielded positive results to date and consideration is now being afforded by the Garda authorities to having a nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted on the remains.</p><p><br />  The advances provided by DNA testing are of considerable value to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na not only in criminal investigations but also in the identification of missing persons.  Certain tests are carried out by the Forensic Science Laboratory in Ireland; other less frequently required specialised testing may be carried out abroad.  While the DNA testing available here and abroad is often very effective, the advice to the Minister is that it is not always technically viable.  The Garda authorities have advised the Minister that an expert assessment is being carried out of the merits of performing the tests mentioned by the Deputy.  This is not simply a budgetary matter as has been suggested.  The advice to the Minister is that further testing may not be successful since the extraction of DNA profiles from bones that have been in the water for a long period is rather difficult because the sea has been found to cause substantial degrading of DNA material.</p><p><br />  It is beyond the scope of the debate to make detailed scientific judgments.  Therefore, the Minister believes this assessment should be allowed to proceed and its outcome taken on board by the Garda.  He acknowledges the concerns of the Deputy and others to ensure all that can be reasonably done to help the families is actually done.  He shares that concern, but he is also mindful of the need not to do anything which might give rise to undue expectations about the possibilities that the available tests might provide.  Accordingly, he considers that the best course of action is to await the outcome of the assessment before making more conclusive comments on the matter.</p></speech>

It is necessary to do so.  There is a contradiction because the information I have is that the Garda chief superintendent in Wexford applied for funding to carry out testing and was not given funding.  The fact is that the funding has been applied for.  The Minister of State suggested that if the Garda looked for funding, it would be made available.  I hope this is a misunderstanding rather than anything else.  If funding could be found to ascertain whether the remains found can be linked with the people missing at sea, it would be appreciated.</p><p>I appreciate that the fact the remains have been at sea for a long time makes it more difficult to prove scientifically whether they belong to missing persons but the Department should at least try to see if they can be linked to those who have been lost at sea off the south, south-west and south-east coasts.</p></speech>

It is clear that all in this House share the general concern to support the families of those who, tragically, have been lost of sea and to help them pursue any reasonable avenue for the recovery and identification of the remains of their loved ones.</p><p>  The Minister will, of course, raise the points expressed by Deputy Ferris with the Garda authorities.  He is also confident that the gardaÃ­ are doing all that they reasonably can to assist the families concerned.  The Minister is hopeful that when the assessment, which is currently awaited by the Garda authorities, is finalised there will be more clarity on the possibilities of effective testing of the remains which have been found.  I will bring the views of Deputy Ferris directly to the Minister and the Department's attention.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in, was one of those who did tremendous work on the all-party committee on the proposed amendment and Deputy Adams is on record congratulating the Minister and everybody associated regarding the work that has been done on this proposed amendment.</p><p>  The fact that there is almost universal support for the proposed wording is a tribute to the committee and, indeed, as with some other rare reports and issues, is testament to what can be achieved when all parties co-operate on issues that are not, or at least should not be, party political in nature.  If there was ever an issue that is not party political in nature, it is the rights and entitlements of children, and fair play to everybody concerned.</p><p>  We have noted publicly that the proposed text is not exactly that agreed by the committee and as a matter of course consulted our own legal advisers in regard to minor amendments which we and others feel may be necessary in order to come closer to the spirit of what was agreed at the committee.  Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in has tabled a number of amendments in that spirit which will be debated here.  We are doing so in order to bring the wording closer to the wording favoured by the committee and to strengthen the protections that it is proposed to insert into the Constitution.</p><p>  The amendment after line four is to restore the recognition of the need for equality between all the children of the State as was recognised by the original wording proposed by the committee two years ago.  It also is in line with the republican ethos of equality for all citizens and the need to recognise children as full citizens, something which has not been the case over much of the history of the State.  Tonight we continue last night's debate on the Magdelene Laundries and what happened the children who were put into institutions.  They had no protection and no rights.  We are cleaning up the mess where previous Governments, the political establishment and the State failed children so terribly in the past.  That is what we are trying to do to ensure that there will be protection for children in the future.</p><p>  The amendment to Part 2, to substitute the phrase &quot;brought by the State&quot; with &quot;that the State is party to&quot;, is designed to tighten up the definition of cases involving children in which the State may be involved in any manner, and not just where the State might be the guardian where a child is in public care.  The key concern must be to ensure that the State is clearly defined as the ultimate guarantor of the constitutional rights of children.  That is essential to guard against any situation in which it might be argued in law that no one has any right to intervene where there is clear evidence of or a strong belief that children are being denied those rights.</p><p>  Later this evening we will be return to the debate on my party's Private Members' motion on the Magdalene Laundries and the horrors that led to underline the dangers of a situation in which citizens, many of them legally children, were denied basic human rights.  That is a legacy of a hopefully receding past, but one the consequences of which still need to be addressed in order to ensure justice for the survivors.</p><p>  Of course, it could also be argued that at the time of the Magdalene Laundries and the industrial schools the State had abdicated its responsibilities in that regard and, in effect, privatised what was regarded to be a solution to a supposed problem of girls and women who were perceived to have offended against supposed social norms of morality.  That underlines the importance of enshrining basic rights in the Constitution so that the protection of those rights are never subject to current prejudices or even political ideology, but are enshrined in law.  That, indeed, is the purpose of a Constitution and the ability to amend that Constitution, as is proposed here, ensures that it can be brought into line with changing circumstances.</p><p>  The ideological issue relates to the period in which Bunreacht na hÃireann was drafted.  It contains many positive aspects and in the context of the time was not the uniformly reactionary document which some now see it as.  There were genuine concerns about the role of the state in the 1930s when most of the peoples of Europe were under totalitarian rule of one form or another.  Other European democracies did not have a constitution and that was seen as making them vulnerable to the erosion of rights.</p><p>  Totalitarianism regards people not as free citizens of a state but as virtual state slaves, here only to do the bidding of the state. The concept of rights does not exist.  However, the other extreme of claiming that the state ought to have no business in legislating in areas such as children rights, is equally flawed.</p><p>  There are clearly circumstances where the rights of children need to be protected even against their own parents.  We have seen in many instances where that was required and, unfortunately, will in the future require direct public intervention and in some instances the removal of children from dangerous family situations.</p><p>  While most people appear on poll and other evidence to be satisfied with the proposed amendment to the Constitution, there are some dissenting voices.  They deserve to be allowed state their case and their arguments need to be taken on.</p><p>  One of the arguments in opposition is that the proposed amendment will give the State too much power and might even potentially lead to a situation in which the State would have tyrannical powers over parents and families.  Examples have been given by opponents of children potentially being taken from their parents because a teacher, nurse or other person in contact with a child formed an opinion that the child was in actual or potential danger.  There is a certain validity to that argument but it does not carry sufficient weight to counter the need for the provisions proposed.  Professionals in contact with children need to be properly trained in the area of dangers to children and there ought to be safeguards against arbitrary and mistaken interventions.  However, that is not a strong enough argument against what is proposed in this amendment.  My party's advice also is that there is no danger, as argued by some of the more extreme opponents of the amendment, that the State will, in effect, become the ultimate legal guardian of all children.</p><p>  Of course, we must also recognise that the State has a responsibility to improve its own dealings in the area of child protection.  There is the historical legacy of the industrial schools and the Magdalene laundries, but also more recent and current shortcomings.</p><p>  One of these is the situation of children in the care of the HSE.  A worryingly large number of those children attempt or are successful in leaving HSE accommodation.  At present, in the region of 200 children are officially under HSE care but are unaccounted for.  That is not an acceptable situation.  While there are clearly many factors involved, it is an area that needs to be further investigated to ensure that children are not disappearing into lives of great potential danger, including trafficking.</p><p> In conclusion, my party welcomes the decision to hold a referendum on children's right and sees it as a positive step for society.  We look forward to debating our proposed amendments and to studying the provisions in the current wording.  We are dealing with a terrible legacy and there are concerns regarding the State becoming the guardian of the child.  The State must be the guardian of the rights of the child, not the guardian of the child, just as it must be the guardian of the rights of every citizen.  If we as legislators can do anything towards improving the Constitution, what we do must concern protecting rights and ensuring the rights of children, senior citizens and everybody are protected.  I look forward to the debate, but overall it is a welcome development.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister on doing so and on the publication of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2012, which facilitates the adoption of children born to a marital family but who are in long-term foster care, which I understand will be defined as being for a period of at least 36 months.  This referendum will have a particularly significant impact in ensuring there are no inequalities between children when it comes to adoption.  It is amazing the number of people I have met in the course of my professional life who were unable to recognise this distinction, but a number of articles that have appeared of late have been very useful in informing the public of this particular aspect of adoption.</p><p><br />  The Minister has outlined a number of key objectives in the proposed constitutional amendment, including the protection of children and a focus on the &quot;best interest&quot; principle.  The concept of &quot;best interest&quot; is already well known and illustrated in Irish law and was a core element of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Adoption Act 2010.  It is a well defined principle, but it is now being given the <i>imprimatur</i> of constitutional backing.  Other core objectives are supporting families, the removal of inequalities in the area of adoption and the recognition of children in their own right.  The voice of the child will now be heard, as circumscribed in the new Article 42A.4.2<sup>o</sup>.  This is important, notwithstanding the fact that in family law proceedings the voice of the child could be heard.  Now, however, this provision will part of the bedrock of the Constitution.</p><p><br />  Our Constitution is now 75 years in existence.  It is the origin of the fundamental or basic laws of the State and guarantees a wide range and spread of personal rights.  We must acknowledge that many rights have, through judicial interpretation, been expounded upon as a result of proceeding through the High and Supreme Courts and we must be grateful for the level of judicial activism that put flesh on many rights through the interpretation of constitutional law, our bedrock or fundamental source of law.</p><p><br />  Children have rights under the Constitution, under Articles 41, 42, 43 and 44, which are the same fundamental rights granted to all ordinary citizens of the State.  These rights are implicit.  However, the conundrum arises when we examine the express constitutional provisions for references to children.  It is only in Article 42.4, which concerns the provision of free primary school education, we find direct reference to children.  We will leave aside for now the notion of free primary school education, which has never been as expensive as it is now.  Those who say children are virtually invisible within the Constitution are broadly correct in their analysis.</p><p><br />  The primacy of the nuclear family is defined in the Constitution and the special protection afforded the family under Article 41 remains firmly preserved and is not impacted upon by the insertion of this new amendment.  This is as it should be.  As parents, we are acutely aware that the rights of parents and children are always inextricably linked.  This fact can be garnered from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, introduced in 1989 and adopted and ratified by us in 1992.  The family is recognised as the fundamental grouping in society and as the natural environment for the growth and well-being of children.  Parents have, therefore, primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of their child.</p><p><br />  Article 18 of the convention affirms that the family requires protection and assistance to fulfil its responsibilities and places a clear duty on the State to support parents in rearing their children.  Of course, children have a right to be cared for by their families and this duty places an onus on parents to which they have not always adhered.  As we have seen from recent HSE performance monitoring reports, there are 6,282 children in the care of the State and 5,724 of these are in foster care.</p><p><br />  A number of rights interpreted in the Constitution and originating in the umbrella Article 40.3.1<sup>o</sup> are termed unenumerated rights, because they are not found directly in the wording.  However, as stated previously, they have derived from judicial interpretation.  In the absence of judicial activism, such rights might not have been found, and even when found, they are not absolute and can be limited or circumscribed by subsequent judicial decisions or by Government inspired legislation to restrict their application.  I could mention 100 of these in the education area that I have come across in practice.  Therefore, if a right is not expressed, it may not be found and if it is found, it can be subsequently circumscribed or restricted.  That is the simple reason we need the amendment.  There is no big hullabaloo about anybody interfering with a family or trying to rush in and take children away from parents.</p><p><br />  We are all aware that children's rights are determined by the marital status of the child's parents.  Therefore, Article 42A focuses on the protection afforded to children under the Constitution, while respecting and preserving the rights of parents and the family.  This is now a kind of stand alone provision.  The new provision recognises explicitly that children have rights and that all children are equal.  This, thereby, permits the balancing of constitutional rights where necessary.  In other words, we are recalibrating the rights in a hierarchy.  The principle of the paramountcy of the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; to guide court decisions when resolving disputes involving adoption, guardianship, custody or access and the acceptance of the principle of &quot;hearing the voice of the child&quot; in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child will now have constitutional affirmation if this amendment is passed.</p><p><br />  We are all aware of the background to the reasons this amendment is required.  I will not recount these as they have been referred to by Deputies Ferris, Troy and the Minister.  We are acutely aware of the failure of the State in numerous cases to intervene in a timely way, especially in cases of abuse and neglect.  Therefore, it is vital it facilitates State intervention and thereby places an onus on the State to support families and adopt a proportionate State response to parental failure.  The State must step up to the mark.  We should acknowledge it has a chequered history with regard to where children are concerned.  We cannot now just put down a marker and say that is the end of the matter.</p><p><br />  The reformation of the adoption laws is an important step, with over 6,200 children in the care of the State and approximately one third of these children in long-term care for more than five years.  Some of these have had little or no contact with their birth parents.  The legislation that will be introduced once this amendment is passed will allow children in the care system who have been abandoned to be eligible for adoption if this is in the best interest of the child.  Likewise, it will allow that children can be voluntarily placed for adoption, but with due safeguards to ensure that such a decision is not made under any coercion.</p><p><br />  Recently, I read an excellent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i> by Dr. Aisling Parkes and Dr. Simone McCaughren, both lecturers and experts in their respective areas of law in UCC.  This article expanded in a lucid and comprehensive way on what this referendum will mean to those in long-term foster care.  It focused in particular on the fact that currently it is virtually impossible for children born to married parents who are placed in long-term foster care to be placed for adoption, despite obvious failures on the part of the parents in caring for the children.  It also pointed out that unlike other children, such as those who grow up in their birth families or who have been adopted, these foster children are only afforded partial inclusion in family life and remain in a state of limbo.</p><p><br />  Under the new adoption Bill, marital children will be eligible for adoption once they have been in foster care for a continuous period of 36 months preceding the date of application.  The Bill provides as a protection that there must be no reasonable prospects that the child's birth parents will be able to care for the child properly so as not to impact negatively his or her safety and welfare.  This provision will only apply in the exceptional circumstances outlined by the Minister.</p><p><br />  Where children are capable of forming or expressing their own views, their voices will be heard and given weight in adoption cases.</p><p>That will depend on the age and maturity of the child.  The evaluation will be predicated on what is in the child's best interests.  I can do no better than to repeat the conclusion delivered by Dr. Parkes and Dr. McCaughren in their excellent article:<blockquote>This referendum has the potential to change children's lives for the better by enshrining their rights in our Constitution.  A constitutional provision that promotes the legal, emotional and social needs of all children who remain vulnerable in Irish society should be embraced.</blockquote>All that remains for me to say is I hope the referendum will be passed and that the necessary resources will be provided to enable the Minister to achieve what is set out in the Bill and the constitutional provision it will introduce.</p></speech>

As she is sitting in front of me, I take the opportunity to compliment her on the work she has done to date.  This is the first truly all-party issue to have come before the House since I was elected, in the sense that we have put aside our political differences in the interests of children who unquestionably comprise our most important resource.  While politics is an adversarial business, it has to be acknowledged that everybody has come together in this instance.  The importance of the referendum cannot be understated in that context.</p><p>  In the light of the Government's commitment to hold a number of referendums, it has been suggested some sort of league table should be drawn up to categorise them in order of importance.  As someone who has three children, it should be beyond question that nothing is more important to Irish people than how our youngest and most vulnerable citizens are treated, protected and cared for.  Our history as a people is by no means perfect in this regard.  Much of what we have been reading in recent days should reinforce the ambition of the people to start the process of making a statement about ourselves and our intentions as a people, race and nation.  Perhaps the most positive aspect of the referendum is that it gives us an opportunity to begin to effect real change for everybody in the country.  I do not believe the referendum will affect the vast majority.  I hope and pray it will not.  It will serve to protect the important institution of the family.</p><p>  The State's child protection agencies were required in 30,000 cases last year, some 16,000 of which involved children and some 1,500 involved suspected child sexual abuse.  I remind the House that the Proclamation of the Republic states &quot;the Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally&quot;.  Many believe that quotation comes from Bunreacht na hÃireann, a copy of which I can see on the Minister's desk, but that is not the case.  In a newspaper article today an esteemed judge writes that he believes this reference should have been inserted in the Constitution when it was drawn up.  I suggest it is not too late to place it in the Constitution.</p><p>  It is important to remind the House that organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Barnardos have been supporting the calls for the referendum to be arranged.  In recent years many reports have called for this constitutional protection to be put in place.  It is incumbent on all of us to encourage strong and vibrant debate and explain the four key areas covered in this proposal - protecting children, supporting families, removing the inequalities in the current adoption regime and truly recognising children in their own right for the first time.  The last of these four areas is perhaps the most important because there is a need to take the constitutionally protected views of children into account.  It is of paramount importance that we provide for this in the Constitution.</p><p>  I again compliment the Minister.  I encourage those of us who can influence people on the ground to talk to them in order that it cannot be said on 10 November next that the public is uninformed.  It is part of our job as elected representatives to meet people and give them the information they want.  I will certainly be doing this.</p></speech>

The amendment represents a large amount of work.  I know the Minister and her staff have worked extremely hard and consulted widely to produce a carefully worded change to the Constitution.  Their hard work has paid off, as there appears to be broad agreement for the proposed amendment.  Almost 20 years have passed since the retired Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness first called for constitutional change of this nature.  That request was made on foot of a case in which a father had persistently raped and abused his daughter over a 15-year period.  Successive Governments since have discussed the issue, made promises, examined options, established committees and prepared report after report on how best to protect the rights of children under the Constitution.  It finally took a Fine Gael Minister - a woman at that - to do something about the matter.</p><p>  From the outset, the Government has shown that it intends to be a Government of action with regard to children's rights.  For the first time, a full senior Ministry was established to take responsibility for children and youth affairs.  The Minister has worked tirelessly since she took office.  I commend her for taking responsibility and dealing with this issue.  The proposed change to the Constitution is just one part of a series of actions being taken to create a more child-friendly environment.  One of the inequalities involves the different treatment of children under adoption law, depending on whether their parents are married.  The referendum will address this matter in order that foster parents can adopt children who have been living with them for many years, in some cases.</p><p>  We were all shocked by the findings of the Ryan report, in the Roscommon case and the independent report on child deaths.  The circumstances and attitudes that allowed such abuses to continue have to be challenged and overcome.  We need the referendum to protect the rights of children under the Constitution.  It is important to point out that the amendment supports the family.  Article 41 of the Constitution will continue to protect it.  The referendum is about the safety and welfare of children; it is not about taking children from families.  The State will be able to intervene only in exceptional circumstances, where there is a failure of parental duty.  This is only right, as no child should be sacrificed to protect his or her parents or the institution of marriage.</p><p>  The amendment to the Constitution is the starting block as we strive to protect the children of Ireland.  It is critically important that the appropriate structures are in place to ensure children are protected.  Earlier this year the Minister published the report of the task force on the child and family support agency, which is an essential part of our efforts to respond to the needs of children.  The report is the foundation for a revolution in child protection and family services.  The new agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection and family support for the first time in the history of the State.  Its establishment will mean that when a child comes to the attention of a social worker, an educational welfare officer or a garda, he or she will be brought into a single system and a single continuum of services, all of which will be focused on his or her well-being.</p><p>  We are moving from a position where the provision of child and family welfare services was barely a priority to one where it will be the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a single dedicated Department.  At the heart of the new agency will be a new service delivery framework which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases in order that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by way of new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support services.</p><p>The reference in the proposed constitutional amendment to proportionate responses will further underpin the development of these services.  This is all about family support and early intervention.  Family resource centres will also play an increased and very important role.  I was delighted to hear the Minister state earlier that the legislation to set up the new agency will be introduced and enacted in the current DÃ¡il session.</p><p> The children's referendum is very welcome.  I believe it will mark a turning point in people's attitudes to the issue of children's rights.  As citizens of this country, we all have a collective responsibility and obligation to ensure our children are protected.  Horrific mistakes have been made in the past, there has been a lack of accountability and children have suffered as a result.  It is up to us now to learn from those mistakes as we look to the future.  After all, our children are our future.  When good men and women fail to act, evil prevails.</p></speech>

I welcome its presentation by the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in her new Department and congratulate and thank her for completing the work that had been ongoing and bringing it to fruition as a meaningful and positive contribution for all of Irish society.  For too long, children were to be seen and not heard, but now they will have a voice.</p><p><br />  I want to deal with a number of issues and I will deal first with the wording to be put into the Constitution.  I fully support the wording and I want to elaborate on a few areas in which some people may want to pick holes during the referendum campaign.  The first sub-article of the amendment states: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  People have already criticised the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot; but it is a fair and reasonable wording to include in the amendment because, if it were not there, there would be an absolute requirement on the State to provide a particular set of rights over and above everybody else's.  In an ideal world we would not need this but, unfortunately, we live in the real world and people can only do what they can do.  That is why I support the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.</p><p><br />  Sub-article 2.1Â° states: &quot;In exceptional cases, where the parents, regardless of their marital status ...&quot;  This is very important as people are afraid there may be cases in which children will be taken from married parents.  The word &quot;exceptional&quot; is proper.  The Supreme Court is normally quite a conservative body and it will interpret that in a correct manner.  People do not need to fear that anything negative will happen in this regard.</p><p><br />  The sub-article continues: &quot;the State ... shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents ...&quot;  I support the use of the phrase &quot;by proportionate means&quot;, which is important.  I believe that phrase entered the political lexicon recently in regard to judge's pay in that judges were afraid they would be picked out and that this would be disproportionate.  Using the word &quot;proportionate&quot; is correct because everything in society must be proportionate and this will ensure the State acts in a proportionate manner and does not go over the top or drag its feet.  The inclusion of &quot;proportionate&quot; is sensible and, at the risk of sounding clichÃ©d, it is a proportionate word to use in this circumstance.  Again, this sub-article stresses &quot;the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&quot;</p><p><br />  Under sub-article 2.2Â°, &quot;provision shall be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law ...&quot;  There is separate legislation in this regard, the general scheme of which has been published.  If the referendum is passed, which we all hope it will be by an overwhelming majority, that legislation will then be introduced.  It is important that people have sight of this legislation now in case they think there is something coming down the tracks that they do not know about.  During the course of the debate in the weeks before 10 November, people will be looking at this in a little more detail and it is important that they be fully briefed on the legislation.  Initially, we are talking about the referendum but the legislation that will flow from this - if it is passed, as we hope - is equally important in order to give effect to the good intentions we want to insert in the Constitution.</p><p><br />  Deputy Penrose stated that the phrase &quot;failed for such a period of time&quot; refers to a period of three years, which is reasonable.  Up to now, this could have been interpreted to suggest that while a person may have failed, it is not forever.  This would almost abandon the child because of the need to satisfy some judges that a parent had failed in his or her duty if there is even a prospect that he or she might have a Pauline conversion in ten years' time and be willing to look after the child despite not having done so previously.  That issue has now been dealt with.</p><p><br />  Voluntary placement in regard to adoption will also be dealt with in this legislation, which is very important, and sub-article 2.2Â° also refers to the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; being a paramount consideration.  The final provision, sub-article 4.2Â°, states: &quot;Provision shall be made in law for securing, as far as practicable, in all proceedings ... in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child ... shall be ascertained and given due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.&quot;  This is also important.  We all know the views of infants will not be fully informed but a 12 or 14 year old child may be capable and know what is going on.  When we talk about a child, I presume we are talking about minors up to 18 years of age.  Although this might be spelled out during the debate, we need clarity on this issue of obtaining the views of the child.</p><p><br />  I presume all of these cases will be held in the family law courts, as most such cases would have been up to now.  In that situation, they would be held <i>in camera</i>, which is fine, as it is important that the privacy, personal integrity and family details of the people involved are protected from people with a prurient interest in some of these matters.  However, given that we are now putting children's rights into the Constitution, and given that such cases have to be dealt with <i>in camera</i> - as it would be unfair to put children in open court in front of large numbers of people - it must be taken into account that while privacy must be respected and maintained at all stages of the proceedings, there must be some method of ensuring that the outcomes as decided by the various judges in particular family law courts are made available to ensure there is consistency.  If everything is done in private, one judge in one part of the country could be following a particular line for years while another judge in a different part of the country is following quite a different line in similar cases.  It is important that people should not be victims of geography or of the views of a particular judge.  This is why it is important there is some way of monitoring the outcome of these cases while, I stress, respecting the privacy of the people involved.</p><p><br />  Many questions could be asked about why we need the referendum, but that has been well established.  We want to give children a voice because their voices must be heard.  We also want to ensure they have a chance to be adopted and become part of a family, especially where they have been abandoned or are in long-term foster care, and to ensure the State will respond much more quickly than it perhaps has in the past in cases of abuse and neglect.  We also want to ensure that in judicial settings, as I have outlined in regard to the wording, the child is at the centre of the case and is given paramount consideration.  We want to ensure the abuse that happened in the past does not occur again in the future.</p><p><br />  While preparing my notes for the debate, I was reminded of a case referred to by many speakers, the Kilkenny incest investigation carried out by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, which was presented to the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 1993.  The Minister has been quite right in pointing to a period of several decades during which we were aware of issues and all parties in government, while they did something, could have done more.  To go back to 1993, the Minister, Deputy Howlin - who is now back in government - will, when he looks at that report, probably ask himself why it has taken so long to bring this to fruition.  However, it is good that it is now happening 20 years on.</p><p>That location is only a few short miles from where I was born and reared.  I remember when it came to light there was shock among the local community.  We were living in an era where issues that went on within families were swept under the carpet and kept behind closed doors.  Thankfully we have a much more open society now where those types of issues are not kept behind closed doors and people no longer believe that if it is a family matter, they should not butt in.  That is a legacy of former times.</p><p> If memory serves me correctly it was 1979 when I first voted and it was in a referendum on adoption.  On the same day there was a referendum about amalgamating the Seanad panels for the University of Ireland and Trinity College.  I do not know what happened to that second referendum.  It was passed by the people but someone must have made a drafting error and perhaps the wording did not stand up.  The adoption referendum was passed overwhelmingly, with almost 100% support.  In the referendum on whether Trinity College and the NUI should be amalgamated into one panel in the Seanad, around 6% or 7%, primarily made up of Trinity graduates, voted against.  It seems the wording was flawed in some way because it never came to pass, despite the people voting in favour of it.  I believe I am correct in saying that the purpose of the adoption referendum was to copperfasten the rights of adoptive families under the Constitution, which gave primacy to the natural family or marital family.  A concern was raised about adoptive families having constitutional protection.  I remember it well because it was the first time I voted and here we are again, in 2012, voting on a similar---</p></speech>

That referendum was also passed but for some reason it never came to pass.  There was some flaw found in the wording of that referendum.  I often ask what happened to that provision.</p><p>  Time is running short.  Some people might believe that to speak for 20 minutes on an issue like this would be difficult but I could speak for twice as long if the time was available.  While this is strictly a non-party-political issue, I wish to point out that previous Governments set up the Office of the Minister for Children and former Deputies Brian Lenihan, Mary Hanafin, Brendan Smith and Barry Andrews had special responsibility for children at various times.  Some were what we would now call &quot;super juniors&quot; and sat at the Cabinet table.  I welcome the decision to give full Cabinet rank and a full Ministry to Deputy Fitzgerald.  There has been a continual evolution in terms of the opening up of Irish society, which has crystallised in the Minister's appointment.</p><p>  I always felt that a Minister for Children was necessary.  Nothing convinced me more of that need than when, in 2010, the Fine Gael spokesman on justice, Deputy Alan Shatter, issued a report, without proper protocol, on two children who died in care.  On that particular day there was a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and I asked Professor Brendan Drumm how many children had died in the care of the HSE.  He had no idea, not an iota.  He had no clue.  Professor Brendan Drumm was an excellent chief executive of the HSE and did outstanding work from a medical point of view, but there is only so much one person can do.  The issue of child care did not rank up there with cancer treatment, orthopaedics, accident and emergency waiting times, waiting lists, discharge policies and so forth.  It became clear to me then that nobody in the HSE was giving priority to children.  I praised Deputy Shatter at the time, which was not a popular thing to do among my colleagues on the Government side because they felt he had broken the rules by publishing the report.  He did the State some service by doing that because ultimately it forced the HSE to act and under Cathal Magee, Professor Drumm's successor, a report on the 196 children who died in care was published.  That needed to be done because there was total neglect of this area.  The child care services in the HSE were the poor relation and might have continued to be were it not for the reports that came into the public arena.  Deputy Shatter has contributed to where we are today and while he may have broken some technical rules about issuing reports - some might even argue that legally he was wrong to do it - he was right in the general approach he took.  He forced the HSE to examine its files and find out how many children died while in care or shortly after leaving care and then issue a full report.</p><p>  It has already been said here that this referendum is not a panacea for problems related to children but is an important step.  When the Minister gets the weight of the public behind her on 10 November, with an overwhelming vote in favour of this referendum, I hope that will translate into good financial resources to make the wishes of the people of Ireland, as expressed through the ballot box, come true.  If the people go to the trouble to come out on a Saturday, taking time out of their family life, and vote overwhelmingly in favour but then find that budgets for children's services are cut, they will feel badly cheated.  Given that the Government has decided to hold this referendum, it must follow through with the financial resources to back it up afterwards.  We are seeing such cuts already.  The services provided by the respite care centre for children in Mountrath, County Laois, for example, have been scaled back remarkably.  That centre serves children with special needs, which would be in the Minister's own area, as well as Deputy Kathleen Lynch's at the Department of Health.  Everyone praised the Paralympians and people with special needs during the summer but once the event was over, people had seen the gold medals and the publicity died down, we were back to the harsh reality of limited resources for services.</p><p>  There are two issues that I ask the Minister to address during the course of this debate, which are not specifically related to the referendum, but are in the realm of unintended consequences, to use the Civil Service speak.  At the moment there are up to 6,000 children in care, the majority of whom are in foster care.  The foster parents who are standing in for the natural parents who are not in a position to care for their children are doing all of us in society, the children themselves, as well as the natural parents, an enormous service.  They are rightly being compensated for the cost involved in taking a child into their homes.  It is important that if such families want to move on and adopt the foster child they are caring for, they will not find themselves at a financial loss by choosing to adopt rather than continue to foster.  Some type of transition payment must be introduced to assist those people who have taken children in, with goodwill and a big heart.  They would not have fostered children in the first place unless they had the heart, interest and fondness for children but they should not be financially disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to take that issue into account.</p><p>  The second issue that I ask the Minister to address relates to the points raised by groups such as Fathers for Justice.  In many one-parent families, the mother is rearing the child and the father is not on the scene.  The mother may be living with somebody else and the father of the child is not welcome.  The majority of these cases do not go to court because the father does not have legal guardianship.  I am not sure if the Minister has considered this but let us take a situation where a parent who has a child is no longer capable of caring for him or her and the HSE takes the child into care.  In due course, the HSE might decide that the foster family caring for the child should be allowed to adopt.  What if the other parent who had not been given the opportunity to participate in the child's life then comes forward and wants to be part of the child's life?  That parent might argue that he or she was essentially locked out by social and family circumstances.  In most cases, the parent in question would be an unmarried father.  Such fathers want to be assured that their child could not be adopted against their wishes.  I understand there are issues in the proposed adoption legislation for non-voluntary adoption where the parent has failed in his or her duty.</p><p>Will the Minister clarify the position in a case where one parent has failed in his or her duty but the other parent is now willing to step into the breach?  The voluntary placement for adoption of a child of marital parents is also being dealt with in the Bill.</p></speech>

I accept there is legislation governing guardianship <i>ad litem</i> but I understand the relevant section of the legislation has never been formally commenced.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the matter last year.  I seek that the Minister&#8217;s officials would check out the matter.  I was asked about the issue by a father.  Courts were instructing fathers to contribute to the cost of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> report.  The parliamentary question I tabled in the past year related to when the section relating to guardianship <i>ad litem</i> was commenced but I was informed that it was not commenced.  I urge the Minister to check out the matter because it is possible that judges could be breaking the law on the Bench every day by referring to such matters if the relevant measures have not been commenced.  We support the referendum and the greater emphasis on children.  This step is part of a continuum as society grows up, moves on and becomes more open.  It is a reflection of where we are as a society.</p><p><br />  The big issue that will arise in the coming weeks is media coverage because the national broadcasters are required to provide a 50:50 balance.  I do not know how that will work.  Perhaps they will have to curtail their coverage and there will be a greater emphasis on us as political leaders and non-governmental organisations to campaign vigorously if the media is not in a position to do so.  We do not want the situation to arise where it is necessary to deliberately manufacture a row on &#8220;The Frontline&#8221; for example to ensure an equal balance in coverage, if a valid editorial decision is taken that it is not the correct thing to do.  In the event of media coverage being reduced then the rest of us must step into the breach and do as much as we can.  In the previous referendum the Government spent a lot of money before the Referendum Commission was formally established and legislation was passed to allow the Government to put its case.  It did not come into the reckoning under the terms of the McKenna judgment.  There might be an opportunity to spend money before the formal writ for the referendum date is moved.  Unfortunately, we might have to get around the strict ruling of the Supreme Court on the issue.  I suspect that if a referendum such as this were in question the Supreme Court might have come to a different conclusion.</p><p><br />  We look forward to a good turnout on Saturday, 10 November.  We want people to come out and vote &#8220;Yes&#8221; and give their support for the referendum.  We want that to be followed up by an announcement in the first week of December of a handsome increase in budget resources for children to back up the referendum result.</p></speech>

It is something on which others have toiled and striven over a considerable period.  At this stage it is approximately 30 years since the first efforts were made to bring about the introduction of a provision relating to childrenâs rights and their protection under the Constitution.  The Minister has managed to bring the provisions before us in rapid time -18 months - and a target date for the referendum to take place in the month of November.  That is exemplary.</p><p>  I also compliment the Minister on the good work she has done on adoption.  Last Monday she signed an agreement with Vietnam to reopen and restart adoptions between the two countries.  That is a tremendous achievement considering the amount of effort that was made in the past without any result being achieved.  I compliment the Minister strongly on the active role she has taken since becoming Minister in delivering the commitment in the programme for Government, which was often promised in the past but was not delivered.</p><p>  It is incredible that almost 100 years have elapsed since an emerging nation promised to &quot;cherish the children of the nation equally&quot;.  That is one of the most quoted parts of the 1916 Proclamation, yet only now are we giving recognition and protection to children in the Constitution.  In the intervening period, child abuse was widespread in society, as various reports reveal, together with the testimonies of more than 13,000 children, now adults, who came before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  They reveal accounts of abuse - physical, sexual, emotional and mental in the various institutions that were in the control of the State, and others that were not in the State's control but should have been.  That is one of the great failures of more than 90 years of Irish statehood and independence, which has totally undermined the commitment in the Proclamation.</p><p>  As far back as 1979, when I was chairman of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, an inquiry was established into the prison system chaired by Sean MacBride, SC, and Professor Louk Hulsman.  The current President, Michael D. Higgins, and the previous President, Mary McAleese, were both members of the organisation.  At the time we conducted a survey of 200 ex-prisoners living in Dublin for the public inquiry.  We discovered that more than 80% of the survey cohort had spent much of their childhood in reformatories or industrial schools.  The existing legislation often committed them to many years in industrial schools and they were often forgotten in those institutions.  The ex-prisoners were damaged by the system in which they had spent their youth and they were further damaged subsequently and their adult lives ruined.</p><p>  For the first time, the Bill and referendum give Irish children full rights as citizens in their own right in the Constitution.  That is crucially important, that they are getting those rights by virtue of their own right as citizens not by proxy through anyone else.  There is something incongruous, almost perverse, that in conducting a public debate over the next six weeks 50% of the time will be given to the small minority in the country who may argue against the proposed assertion of children's rights in the Constitution, as outlined in the referendum proposals.  The media, and in particular RTE, should explore every mechanism for a balanced and fair debate within the constraints of the Supreme Court judgment so as to avoid creating a false polarisation dictated by a crude allocation of time on the basis of virtual opposition.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the long-awaited children's referendum is finally to be put to the Irish people.  Too many years have passed since it was first suggested, and too often this issue has been put off for another day.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is to be congratulated on publishing the text of the proposed amendment to the Constitution and for ensuring that the proposed amendment has such broad support.  It is important that we include in the Constitution a stand-alone article dedicated to children and we acknowledge that children's rights are not subordinated to the rights of parents but are recognised as being fundamental in themselves.  The Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness noted almost 20 years ago that the Constitution may be &quot;interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents, than to the rights of children&quot;.  Since that time, successive Governments have examined the issue, but until now no action has been taken.  While these matters were being examined, for example in the Roscommon incest case, the State was prevented from acting to defend abused and neglected children.  The parents of those poor children brought a successful High Court challenge to prevent child protection services from acting, and the children continued to suffer.  An anomaly exists in terms of the current interpretation of the constitutional provisions.  That is something which must be eliminated.</p><p>For most children, the best place to be is with their families and the proposed amendment does not alter the assumption in law that this is the case.  However, for a small number of children it is not always the case.  The proposed amendment provides for when and how intervention by the State should occur.  It will ensure that in exceptional cases where, due to parental failure, the safety and welfare of any child is at risk, the focus will be on addressing the impact of that failure on the child.  For these children, this referendum will ensure that the State can provide early intervention and family support to protect them in their home, by providing constitutional recognition to the concept of "proportionate" responses to child protection concerns.  Where such efforts are not successful the State can ultimately go further in ensuring the child's protection and, if required, make alternative arrangements.</p><p> The proposed rights and protections incorporated in the amendment are for the benefit of all children, irrespective of the marital status of their parents.  The aim is that children of married and non-married parents will be treated equally when it comes to protecting their safety or welfare, their access to adoption and the consideration of their best interests and views in key proceedings.  All these factors will be taken into consideration.  In particular, the amendment provides for the making of legislation to allow for adoption where it is in the best interests of a child who is in foster care because of the serious and persistent failure of his or her parents, irrespective of the marital status of the parents.  It also facilitates the making of legislation to allow for the voluntary placement of a child for adoption.  The aim of these changes is to give children in foster care a better opportunity to experience the security of a loving, caring family.</p><p> I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has also published the draft Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2012 which the Government plans to bring before the Oireachtas on the passing of this referendum.  The proposed amendment also requires that the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration and that the voice of the child be given due weight in court proceedings taken by the State relating to child protection and in matters relating to adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  It should be the case wherever possible that the voice of the child should be heard.</p><p> By voting &quot;Yes&quot; on 10 November, the Irish people will remove inequalities in adoption and will help ensure that vulnerable children are not denied the help and support they may require.  This child-centred approach is present in both the legislation and the referendum proposals.  Last year, approximately 1,500 children were identified as having been abused, sexually, physically or emotionally, and 30,000 children were dealt with in terms of protection and welfare.  That is a very sizeable proportion of the children in the country.  It is very important that we get the basic framework document right, namely, the determining body of rights in the Constitution.  Up to the present we have denied the children of this country; on 10 November we propose to address this.  I wish to ensure this outcome comes about with the highest possible percentage of the people voting &quot;Yes&quot;.  The obligation is on Members to ensure that all sides of this House in favour of this legislation - as all are - get good campaigns going on the ground to ensure that is the case.</p></speech>

It is good that we are at this point and these measures should be supported.  I welcome that there is support on all sides of the House for this worthy amendment to the Constitution, one that is pertinent and necessary.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p>  The amendment will create the new stand-alone article, Article 42A, which will achieve a number of objectives.  First, it will establish the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and facilitate a situation whereby the State, by proportionate means, can endeavour to supply the place of the parents, always with due regard to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  The parallel legislation will provide for the adoption of children whose parents have failed them over a period of time, and as prescribed by law.  It will provide for the views of children to be taken into consideration, which is critically important.  It is worth mentioning at the outset these salient points of the new proposed article.  </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that the wording in no way threatens the position and primacy of the family, as outlined in the Constitution.  Rather it accepts that primacy and the special status of the family but, in parallel with that status, it equally gives imprescriptible, inalienable and unmovable rights to the child and puts them on a constitutional and statutory basis.  That is a critical point to make - there is no conflict with the rights of the family which remains centre-stage and a centrepiece of the Constitution.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the need for this referendum is underpinned by a number of reports and commissions down the years.  It was first called for by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness on foot of the Kilkenny incest case.  The need for a referendum is very obvious arising from the Ryan report, the Kelly Fitzgerald case and the Cloyne report and, very obviously, from the Roscommon case.  That case was very recent and was an appalling horror story.  In that case it was possible for the parents of those unfortunate children, thus described by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to go to court and prevent the removal of the children from the family home by invoking the special status of the family.  Although individual judges would look to individual rights and apply them to children, and there would be many cases of benign judgments by individual judges, and although the potential within the Constitution already exists for same, we must copperfasten the position of children to the extent there can be no case whereby, through human error or misinterpretation of the Constitution, the rights of children could be submerged, go into second place and have a secondary status.</p><p>  The very eminent judge, Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, made the argument in a recent newspaper article that in its present form the Constitution allows judges to make rulings that would support children.  Although that may be the case the possibility for alternative rulings, as demonstrated in the Roscommon case, is enough of a rationalisation, justification or reason for this constitutional amendment.  If averting the horror, cruelty, pain and suffering endured by a few children - there are many more than a few - were to be the only outcome of our making this amendment it would be justified.  That point merits making as does another interesting observation, namely, that this amendment will actually support the family to the extent that it will underpin family support services.  In other words, there will be a constitutional imperative for positive interventions in support of the welfare of children within families because of the standing of children within the Constitution, whether such interventions are financial or offering professional assistance, etc.</p><p> I had the privilege recently of visiting the Extern service in my home area of County Cavan.  It is a group under the auspices of the Health Service Executive which works with children from dysfunctional families who have particular social and emotional difficulties.  They are children at great risk but Extern works very effectively with those children.  There will now be a constitutional imperative on this Legislature to support people such as those in Extern, those in Youthreach and families in difficulty.  Rather than undermining the family and taking children from the family home, the onus will be to support the family and create the ideal conditions in families.  It is only when that effort breaks down and there is a clear threat to the well-being of the children that they would be removed.</p><p> It merits mentioning that this constitutional amendment will provide an opportunity for adoption of children from married couples.  That is an important dimension.  As the law stands, while there may be a theoretical possibility of adoption of children from married couples it would have to be established that the child is at risk until the age of 18 and that he or she would remain permanently at risk.  It is well nigh impossible to adopt the child of a traditional married couple, even though that child is in continuous foster care.  The legislation states that the children will have to be out of the home and in continuous care for a minimum of three years.  It states also that they would have to be 18 months with the family which proposes to adopt them.  All of those safeguards are built in but it will now allow children from marriages to be adopted.  Also, apart from State intervention a married couple can offer their child for adoption if they know that is in the best interests of the child and that is established by all the relevant authorities.  That is an important dimension of the amendment.</p><p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, stated, all of the parties have publicly supported this measure, and that is to be applauded, which will ensure that for once the voices of children will be heard officially and that will be reflected in the Constitution but it is imperative to back that up with an effective campaign in the coming weeks and that we bring this to the people.  It is significant legislation in the light of the many areas where we have failed children in the past.  We have an enormous amount in terms of children's issues but that is not what we are discussing today.  We have failed significantly also and in light of those failures it is incumbent on us to redress those failures with an effective campaign beginning this afternoon.</p></speech>

It is great progress.  I have read a good deal on this in the past week but regardless of what I read, I had a meeting this morning with representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance and having listened to their argument and the information I got from them, I have to say I will not be able to sum it up any better than them.  As they say, if you cannot beat it, why not repeat it?</p><p>  The Children's Rights Alliance gives five key reasons for supporting the children's referendum.  First, for the first time the Constitution will take a child-centred approach to the protection of all children and will allow for the State better to support families that are struggling rather than wait for a situation to reach crisis point.  No one can have a problem with that.  Obviously, that is a welcome development.  Second, it will allow up to 2,000 children currently in long-term State care the opportunity to be adopted and given a second chance to have a loving, stable and permanent family.  We have seen situations in the past where that was not possible and it created hell for some of those children.  That is very welcome.</p><p>  Third, it will base child care, adoption, guardianship, custody and access decisions on what is best for the interests of the child.  Yet again, no one can argue with that.  It is obvious.  Unfortunately, for years the State was more focused on preserving the family regardless of the hell the family brought on the child.  This is a welcome measure.</p><p>  Fourth, it will ensure the judges listen to the views of children when making decisions in child care, adoption, guardianship, custody and access cases.  I understand this is where the children are old enough or they have the mental capacity to do so.  That makes sense.  Obviously, we should listen to the child.  The child will be able to tell us what is happening and what is best for them.</p><p>  Fifth, it will set out how we as a country now view and value children and move beyond the damning history of child abuse in Ireland.  Again, one could not disagree with that.</p><p>  Obviously, this is good news but the cloud of resources hangs over everything.  Without resources, how can we successfully achieve what we are trying to achieve?  In recent days some organisations stated that we are facing a further six or eight tough budgets in a row, and that will affect resources.</p><p>  I have spoken to people who work in this area and while they are delighted that something is finally being done and well done on that, they are worried that when this happens, if it does happen, the resources will not be in place to deal with the consequences.  In some child care facilities children who have been sexually abused are housed with children who have sexually abused.  We have situations where children have got over the mental torture of what happened to them only for another child, in some cases with serious mental difficulties, to be brought in with them.  That is not on.  As some people who worked in the service would say, and they will remain confidential because they educated me on it, at the current level of resources the Health Service Executive and the State are not a safe family.  If we pass this measure we must make sure that the people we are trying to help are properly helped.</p><p>  I am also told by people who work in this area that there are not enough resources for psychological help, counselling and so on.  That must change.</p><p>  Ideally, no one would end up in these facilities, which will never be ideal because they will never replace the family.  To ensure that fewer people end up in this situation, we must provide support at a very young age.  I hope the Family Support Agency will sort that out.  In that way we will have more resources in the long term.  It is cheaper and less expensive to do that at an early age which means we will have more resources for the hard cases.</p><p>  I am aware from talking to many people who work in this area that it breaks their heart to have to say that they know that many of these children will end up in prison.  There is no shortage of resources at that stage, when it is too late.  The prison in my town spends over â¬100,000 a year trying to help people but if those people had been helped as a child it would have cost a fraction of that.  Resources will be a problem.  If we use resources well we might be able to hold our heads a little higher because at the moment, from what I know about what is going on, I am embarrassed to be a citizen of this country.</p></speech>

To some extent I regard it as a type of cleansing of a shameful record which this State has in the protection of its children.</p><p>We are very keen to blame the churches - rightly so - for the clerical abuse which occurred and also other institutions for what happened to children in our shameful past.  However, the State ignored what was happening, turned a blind eye to it or did not know - when the opposite should have been the case - what was being visited on the children of the nation.  The constitutional amendment is a way of cleansing the conscience of the nation and absolving ourselves for our record in this regard.  In that sense, it is not merely a case of taking an approach similar to that adopted by Pontius Pilate, it is also a way of remedying a situation which was unacceptable.  We should all be ashamed of the culture of turning a blind eye with regard to the abuse of children.  If the amendment has a tangible effect in resolving matters in this regard, then I welcome it.  The debate that will ensue in the forthcoming referendum will assist in cleansing the polluted atmosphere that has surrounded the fate of the children of the nation.</p><p> I was taken by what Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said about children.  We tend to be particularly patronising towards children and their inability to make up their minds and express their views.  The constitutional amendment will also help to remedy matters in this regard.  Children of a very young age can make intelligent decisions in their own interests.  In many instances, they know - far better than adults - what is good for them.  For example, children who are of an age where they can answer questions in an intelligent fashion and who go before the Adoption Board are regularly asked whether being adopted is their wish.  Their reply in this regard is material.  In that context, whether they say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; is absolutely vital.  If a child says he or she does not want to be adopted, his or her wish must be taken extraordinarily seriously and the matter must be investigated.  Let us not be overly patronising towards children; rather let us say they should be consulted in a sophisticated way because they often know - better than adults who are, or who are supposed to be, striving to protect them - what is good for them, what they want and what will fulfil their emotional needs.  The Bill makes a significant advance in that regard.</p><p> In view of State's record in this area, I am somewhat uneasy about it being allowed to intervene, in certain circumstances and as a last resort, where children are under pressure.  However, I do not see a solution to this problem.  I hope a very broad-based, caring and humane body will be put in place to intervene on behalf of children in cases where they are being threatened by those who are looking after them or who are supposed to be doing so or by their protectors or guardians in difficult or controversial circumstances.</p><p> It is welcome that the inequalities in the adoption process are being remedied.  I was unaware - I am sure this was the case with many other Members - that there were still such inequalities.  During the years I have seen a raft of legislation in which the treatment of children has been equalised, regardless of the marital status of their parents.  That is a matter which obviously should be remedied.  If what is before us is the final remedy in removing an existing anomaly, I welcome it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.868" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600042#PP00200"><p>There is much that is good about this long overdue proposed amendment to the Constitution.  I have always believed the absence of specific rights for children has weakened the law for far too long.  I applaud the proposed rebalancing of parental and children's rights in order to ensure the problems of children in seriously dysfunctional families can be addressed and that the marital status of parents cannot be an obstacle in this regard.  No child should be obliged to remain in a family which is dangerous, abusive and neglectful.  The State must be able to intervene to protect such children from harm.  However, I would prefer if the circumstances in which a child can be taken from his or her parents were more clearly defined.  From my reading of it, the constitutional amendment does not appear to outline the position adequately in this regard.  I am aware that a number of amendments on this matter have been tabled and perhaps the Government might give them consideration.</p><p><br />  No one needs to be reminded of the horrors inflicted on generations of vulnerable children.  I hope the legislation will do all that is necessary to prevent a recurrence of these horrors.  Overall, the proposed constitutional amendment will help to protect children, which is an important point.  I understand it will also enable the State to provide better support for vulnerable parents in circumstances where they are struggling to care for their children.  Hence, we will be able to provide services to ensure fewer families reach crisis points which place children at considerable risk of harm.  However, the proposed amendment is a half measure, particularly in view of the fact that the Government is continuing to cut supports for disadvantaged and vulnerable families and children.  I need not remind the Government that in 1992 Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and pledged to make children's rights a reality and ensure every child would have the right to experience a childhood free of poverty and deprivation.  There is nothing in the wording contained in the legislation which will hold the State to this promise.  In the absence of real and practical action, the forthcoming referendum will be nothing more than a symbolic gesture to the many thousands of children at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale.  Do the 10% of Irish children who live in consistent poverty not also deserve a modicum of justice?</p><p><br />  Last week cuts to counselling services in schools were highlighted in the wake of an attempted suicide by a student at a second level school in Wexford.  Teachers will affirm that children's lives are at stake as a result of the crisis affecting counselling services.  No constitutional amendment is going to ameliorate the position in this regard.  These are not good times for children who are reaching adult age.  The Bill will be meaningless for the 75% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years whose futures are uncertain as a result of the fact that they are out of work.</p><p><br />  It is highly commendable that the Government is to strive to refocus the child protection system and increase the obligation of the State to support families.  The State has always had a moral obligation to support families.  Any move to place this on a sound legal footing is to be applauded.  In the absence of adequate investment in child supports, however, this will prove to be just another exercise in bureaucracy.  I regularly come across child welfare cases in my constituency and have written to various Ministers about instances where there is no dedicated social worker available and a care plan is non-existent.  Despite promises to the effect that there would be a nationwide system, out-of-hours social work services are still provided on a very <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Aftercare services are, on the whole, inconsistent and erratic.  I have spoken to many social workers who have acknowledged this.  They may not comment publicly, but they will make their views known to politicians.</p><p><br />  The rights the constitutional amendment will afford to children such as the right to an education are all very well, but how will they impact on, for example, parents who are fighting their way through the system to obtain the services of an SNA for their autistic children?  The amendment has the potential to do a great deal of good and I will be supporting it for that reason.  However, the Government is presenting a very naive view if it attempts to suggest acceptance of the amendment will mean children will no longer be at risk or disadvantaged.  The only way to protect children is by investing money and resources in the relevant services.  To truly look after the welfare of children, we need to find the political will to put in place a multifaceted, joined-up approach.</p></speech>

It is very good that the rights of children are being enshrined in the Constitution but it is also very important that the theory is matched with practice.</p><p><br /> I refer to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage:<blockquote>Constitutional change...gives us a rare opportunity to look at ourselves as a nation and ask if we are truly espousing the correct values.  It gives us an opportunity to assess what we stand for.  Ultimately, constitutional change allows us to consider future generations and ask what Ireland they should live in.</blockquote>Without being smart, I wish to point out that research has shown that the people who suffered most from the last budget were less well-off women and children.  I note the statistics that 90,000 children in Ireland live in consistent poverty and a further 200,000 are at risk of poverty.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office published a special report on homeless persons in Census 2011 on 6Â September 2012 in which it reported that one in eight homeless people is a child under 14 years of age.  The report recorded 457 children under 14 years out of a total of 3,800 people homeless on a single night in 2011. </p><p>The Minister in her contribution stated: &quot;We must hope that all children will have rights, will be protected and will be treated equally.&quot;  The Minister has aspirations for the future and that is good.  However, one important factor in determining how the future will be is the education system.  I note that the playing field is not level in the Irish education system and this has a significant impact on the end result for children.  In my view, people have every right to avail of private education for their children but the Government should make an effort to create a level playing field in so far as possible.  With that in mind I do not think we should be giving State help to schools that are not open to everybody.  This is an aspect of the education system that needs to be dealt with.  I commend the statement in the Minister's contribution: &quot;This is a referendum for all children but, in particular, for those children most vulnerable and most at risk.&quot; </p><p><br /> The inclusion of children of asylum-seekers is an important provision.  I refer to the recent report from the Irish Refugee Council which paints a grim picture of the State system for accommodating asylum-seekers, known as direct provision.  It documents frequent instances of malnutrition among children and expectant mothers as well as diet-related illnesses among babies and young children.  The study highlights cases of weight loss among children and regular complaints of hunger among adults as a result of strict family rationing.  There are more than 1,700 children in the asylum system and they seem to spend on average approximately four years waiting for the processing of their claims for asylum.  The report's author, Samantha Arnold, pointed out that the conditions in which the children live amounted to child abuse and neglect.  This is very upsetting.  She added that both Fine Gael and the Labour Party committed in July 2010 to a review of the system of direct provision but to date these commitments have not been met.</p><p><br /> I wish to raise a technical issue which is not intended as a criticism. I note an observation by Carol Coulter in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  She refers to Article 42A.4.1 which states:<blockquote>Provision shall be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings -Â <br /><br />(i) brought by the State, as guardian of the common good, for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, orÂ Â <br /><br />(ii) concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</blockquote>She questioned what would happen in cases taken against the State and whether the best interests of the child would be considered.  She stated that it might mean that the best interests of the child need not prevail in actions taken by Government Departments, for example, in the placing of an asylum-seeker's children in direct provision accommodation condemned as unsuitable by many NGOs or the widely criticised practice of placing children with mental health problems in adult psychiatric wards or the provision or lack of provision for the education of children with special needs.</p><p><br /> I am not making a criticism of the Bill but rather an observation.  I hope that the State puts the interest of children first in all aspects and that this will be taken into account in the next budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.871" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600043#QQ00300"><p>I wish to share my time with Deputies John O'Mahony and Peter Fitzpatrick.  The journalist Olivia O'Leary wrote a very moving column the other day describing how as a young reporter she had once written a series on adoption for <i>The Irish Times</i>.  She rang a nun, an admirable woman, who was in charge of an orphanage for girls in Dublin.  She told Ms O'Leary how sometimes in the middle of the night, a youngster would wake up and cry out for her mother.  Within minutes, she said, the whole dormitory would be awake, all crying out for their mothers, mothers they had never known and could have had no memory of.</p><p><br />  It is an image which Olivia O'Leary says has always haunted her, of children crying out in the night for their dream of a mother.  It is an image that haunts me too.  It was a mother they would never have - in some cases because they were at an age when adoption was now unlikely to happen, but in many cases because they were the children of legally married parents and could not be adopted.  I agree with Olivia O'Leary that it is extraordinary that we should have created a legal limbo in which children whose parents could not look after them because of drink or drugs or mental illness or other problems, should be forever denied the love of a mother and father and family.  It seems extraordinary to me that this limbo still exists.  The reason is that our Constitution protects the rights of legally married parents but makes no reference to the individual rights of a child.</p><p><br />  As an adopted person myself, I can identify strongly with those children crying out for their mothers.  I understand the longing that children feel to have a mother, a father, a family unit, whether by birth or by adoption.  As Minister for Social Protection, I have committed to introducing legal measures that give children their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which include the right to have information on their birth parents.  I am planning to legislate to allow for the inclusion of the name of the father on a child's birth certificate.  </p><p><br />  I propose to seek Government approval to publish the heads of a civil registration Bill soon.  This will provide further amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 relating to the registration of births and deaths; the validation of marriages at embassies and civil partnerships; to prevent marriages of convenience and to make a number of other amendments.  The Bill will implement recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on legal aspects of family relationships, in particular, that there should be compulsory registration of fathers of children in the case of non-marital births.  This obligation will be modified by the right of the mother not to register the father's particulars where she fears for her safety or that of her child; a proposal to allow a mother to effect registration on foot of a statutory declaration that her legal spouse is not the father of her child, thereby making it easier to rebut the legal presumption of paternity where a woman's husband, who is not the father of her child, is unco-operative or cannot be contacted.</p><p> I have heard various radio discussions where parents expressed the fear of the knock on the door from the social worker who would wish to take their child away from them.  That is emphatically not what the referendum is about.  It is, however, a fear that I understand, given this country's complex history of the wielding of institutional power since the Famine.  There is a collective long-term memory of the institutionalisation of children, and the fears arising out of that experience must be respected.  As a person who had the good fortune to be adopted into a very loving family, I would wish that option to be made available to children in care whose birth parents are unable to fulfil that role.   As I said, I understand the fears regarding social workers.  As a child, I was rather thin and weak looking.  My mother and her friends in the neighbourhood always had a fear that if I did not eat enough, I would be taken away.  Looking at me now, colleagues may find that interesting.  There was a genuine fear of the very powerful institutions and authority figures in Irish life, including the church, local people in authority, the "cruelty man", people from various charitable organisations and members of the judicial system who had the power to put children into institutions for long periods.  That folk memory remains.</p><p> It is important, therefore, to reiterate, as the Minister has set out very clearly, that the proposed amendment encompasses an appropriate proportionality in regard to the powers of the State to intervene in family life.  Everybody will agree that the best place for a child is with his or her parents.  Where that is not possible, however, this proposal seeks to give children in institutional care a second chance to have a loving family.  That is the issue on which we must focus.  We are all aware of situations where it would be most desirable for a long-term fostering arrangement to progress to an adoption relationship, where that is the wish of both foster parents and foster child.  Unfortunately, that is very difficult to achieve under the current legislative and constitutional position.  Even where a child is with his or her foster parents from babyhood or very shortly after, the consent of a social worker is still required in respect of a range of common activities which other parents take for granted, including quite straightforward matters such as trips abroad.  The constitutional amendment we are proposing has a very particular purpose in regard to the position of children in long-term foster care whose married parents are unavailable to care for them or who wish to allow them to go forward for adoption.</p><p> The referendum proposes a major and historic change to the Constitution which seeks to protect children, support families and ensure all children receive equal treatment.  It is nearly 20 years since Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who has since retired, called for constitutional change of this kind.  She made that call in the wake of a case where a father had persistently raped and abused his daughter over a 15-year period.  Since then, we have had a range of reports - 17 in total - detailing abuses of Irish children within the family setting, the environment in which a child should be safest.  In some cases, unfortunately, it was the place of greatest danger for the children concerned.  Now, after all of those horrific reports on a series of child protection failings in Ireland, this Government is taking action.</p><p> The proposal before us today seeks to benefit all children but particularly those who are most vulnerable and most at risk.  The vast majority of children live in loving, caring families and never require the assistance of the State's child protection and welfare services.  Unfortunately, however, that is not universally the case.  Some families require help and support in parenting their children.  In some cases, this might involve addiction and mental health support and family and individual counselling.  The provisions contained in the amendment will support that.  It also provides that in the most serious cases, children may be moved from the family and cared for by people other than their parents.  More than 85% of non-voluntary admissions of children to care in 2011 were due to abuse, neglect and serious family problems.  In the case of children, love is key and comes far above material considerations.  This constitutional amendment seeks to afford certain children a second chance to have that experience of love and cherishing.  As such, I commend it to the House and to the electorate.</p></speech>

It is a long awaited and much needed initiative and I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet on bringing it forward within 18 months of coming to office.  I also welcome the cross-party support for the proposal in the House and the broader universal support from agencies working in the area of child welfare.  Such a consensus is probably unique in the history of the State.</p><p>  Having everybody on the same side is not, however, without its own difficulties and challenges.  Above all, we must guard against any complacency in the lead-up to the referendum in terms of getting the information out to voters.  Other speakers have referred to the implications of the McKenna judgment and the requirement that equal coverage be given to both sides in any referendum campaign.  There is no room for complacency in this campaign and we must work to ensure a high turnout.  In this regard, I welcome the decision to hold the vote on a Saturday, a practice I hope will be continued in other referenda and general and local elections.  It will be particularly helpful to students who live away from home during the week, many of whom will have strong views on this issue.  I urge everybody to exercise their right to vote on the proposal.</p><p>  The objective of the proposed amendment is to ensure that children are visible, protected, listened to, cherished and valued in our society.  In striving to meet that objective, it was important that the proposal should reaffirm the special protection afforded to the family in our society.  In the vast majority of cases, the best place for children, as we all acknowledge, is within a loving and supportive family home.  The proposal seeks to address the minority of cases where children are not protected, heard, valued and cherished, children who, in the past, were forced to suffer in silence.  The amendment will afford children in that minority a second chance.  It was also important that care was taken to ensure the rights and duties of parents are not adversely affected by the proposal.  The Government is to be commended on getting the balance right in this regard.</p><p>  The amendment seeks to protect the minority of children in our society whose plight has too often been ignored.  People were outraged at the revelations in the Kilkenny case, Roscommon case, Kelly Fitzgerald case and many others.  When the publicity died down after a few weeks, however, nothing was actually done.</p><p>I am glad the referendum will result in change by offering citizens an opportunity to insert in the Constitution certain rights and protections for children.  Given that 30,000 child protection concerns were reported to the welfare services, including 1,600 child welfare concerns, this is clearly a major issue.</p><p> I am pleased to note an extensive information programme will be rolled out by the Government.  We all have a responsibility to get our message across.  Given that so many people are on one side of the debate, it is unlikely that all the issues will be teased out in full on television and radio.  We must ensure sufficient information is available to ensure citizens are informed when they cast their vote on 10 November.  I strongly support the proposed constitutional amendment. </p></speech>

This is vital and entirely worthy legislation.  As other speakers - including the Minister - indicated, it constitutes a firm commitment by the Government to protect children, support families and treat all children equally.  The Bill is the culmination of immense work by the offices of the Minister and the Attorney General.  In producing the proposed constitutional amendment, the Minister and Attorney General are addressing and meeting the needs of those within our community who are most vulnerable and, sadly, often without a voice.</p><p>  I encourage everyone to read the documentation in its entirety.  I will take this opportunity to examine sub-article 2.2Â° and focus on a couple of words in particular.  The sub-article states: &quot;In exceptional cases, where the parents, regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected, the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&quot;  The two phrases which are worthy of further emphasis are &quot;the safety or welfare of children&quot; and the description of the State as &quot;guardian of the common good&quot;.  As a parent and citizen of the State, I, like everyone else, have been horrified by reports that have emerged in the recent past.  The cases in question are all the more difficult to understand when I see the unbridled joy and innocence on the faces of children in schools throughout my constituency, including in Ballapousta, Tallanstown, Ballmackenny and the Bay Estate in Dundalk, where my children attended school.  As recently as last week I visited Scoil Mhuire gan SmÃ¡l in Kilsaran and again witnessed the sheer joy and endless capacity of children to give and impart love.  I have focused on the words &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;the common good&quot; because if Deputies witnessed what I and President Michael D. Higgins did last week in Kilsaran, they too would find it inconceivable that anyone could harm children.  For the common good and the good of all children in the State now and in the future, I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment.</p></speech>

Immediately after its publication, the Fianna FÃ¡il Party stated clearly that we fully support the referendum and will campaign strongly for a "Yes" vote.  My colleague and party spokesperson on children, Deputy Robert Troy, has submitted three amendments which we believe   will strengthen the proposed wording.  Throughout this debate, my party will take a totally constructive approach to this important issue both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  The amendments we have tabled have the capacity to strengthen the provision and afford greater protection to children.</p><p>  I am particularly glad the referendum will be held on its own and will not coincide with other referendums or elections.  As I outlined approximately one year ago in the House and in conversations with the Minister, it would not be advisable to put this important question before the people alongside any other referendum or election.  The Taoiseach had suggested in early 2011 that the referendum could be held with the presidential election of October 2011 or alongside other referendums.  I am pleased this has not occurred and that only one issue will be put to the people.  This issue is of such importance that unrelated issues should not be brought into the debate. </p><p>  We had plenty of commentary, not all of it accurate, both inside and outside the House about the delay in finalising the wording of the referendum and putting the proposal before the people.  Regardless of which party or parties comprised the Government, I have always advocated the need to achieve the best and strongest possible wording to ensure the basic rule of law of the country - namely, the Constitution - can facilitate the necessary legislative measures to achieve the objectives of all Members of the Oireachtas. </p><p>  Substantial work has been done over a number of years by many people in public life, non-governmental organisations and the public and Civil Service to prepare for a referendum.  In noting the substantial improvements that have taken place in rolling out services for children, I do not underestimate the major deficiencies that remain in this area.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, referred to the unfortunately large number of cases involving abuse of children and a failure to protect their rights.  All of us recall being shocked and horrified at these reports.  I recall my late colleague, Mr. Brian Lenihan, stating that we should not underestimate the major responsibility that rests on all of us who seek to strengthen the position of the child in our Constitution.  The burden of persuasion in any referendum is a heavy one and all the greater when the proposal relates to the delicate and intimate relationships that exist between child, parent, family and State.</p><p>  The fundamental law of the land, Bunreacht na hÃireann, should reflect our commitment to value and protect childhood.  Provision must be made in our Constitution for children to be protected from maltreatment, neglect or abuse.  The Constitution must require that we protect the welfare of the child and enable us to implement the necessary legislative measures to achieve these objectives.</p><p>  For many years, there have been justified calls from many quarters to strengthen children's rights, including calls for an amendment to the Constitution to reflect the rights of children.  In 1996, it was recommended in the report of the Constitution Review Group that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle and provide an express guarantee of certain other children's rights deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In January 2006, the All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution recommended in its review of the articles dealing with the family that a new section be inserted in Article 41 dealing with the rights of children.</p><p>  In September 2006, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, led the Irish delegation at the United Nations committee hearing on Ireland's second report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The committee expressed concern that some of the recommendations that had previously been made had not yet been fully addressed, particularly those relating to the status of the child as a holder of rights.  The then Taoiseach stated later in 2006 - I believe it was in November - that a referendum on children's rights should take place.  The Minister of State was asked to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the other DÃ¡il parties and all relevant interest groups with the aim of achieving consensus on the wording of an appropriate constitutional amendment.  My understanding is that an extensive round of consultations was held, and the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was published in February 2007.  The Bill proposed a wording to amend the Constitution in respect of children's rights.</p><p>That particular Bill sought to repeal Article 42.5 of the Constitution and insert a new Article 42A.  The proposed text incorporated several separate proposals covering areas such as the imprescriptible rights of the child, adoption, collection and exchange of information on persons who are a risk to children, and absolute and strict liability for offences against children.</p><p> The electoral cycle had moved on and the programme for Government agreed in June 2007 included a commitment to &quot;establish an all-party committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to deepening consensus on this matter&quot;.  The power to change our Constitution rests with the people alone and sovereignty rests in the people.  Time and again, the people of our State have demonstrated their strong attachment to the Constitution.  Proposing an amendment to the Constitution puts an onus on all of us to ensure the appropriate wording is presented.  It goes without saying we all want to see the best possible safeguards and protection for our children.</p><p> Substantial and long overdue legislation has been enacted, particularly since the late 1990s, including the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, the Sex Offenders Act 2001, the establishment of the Garda central vetting unit in 2002, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, the Children Act 2001, the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Act 2000, the Children Act 1997, the Adoption Act 2010 and the publication of the revised Children First guidelines in December 2009.  Those various legislative measures were brought before the Oireachtas by Ministers of different political parties over the years.  It also showed the significant deficiency in the legislative base in this area.  Another important development was the establishment of the Office of Ombudsman for Children.  This officeholder is not appointed by the Minister or the Oireachtas but by UachtarÃ¡n na hÃireann, which denotes the status and the importance of the work this office and its officials do.</p><p> I served briefly as Minister with responsibility for children's affairs in 2007 and 2008.  In October 2007, I advised DÃ¡il Ãireann that it was intended to establish a Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children to further the proposal to amend the Constitution in respect of children's rights.  I believe the establishment of this committee was another important step towards ensuring the legal framework adequately values, respects and protects the rights of children.  The then Government was adamant that the terms of reference meet with the agreement of the Opposition parties.  I worked with the then Fine Gael spokesperson on children's affairs, Deputy Shatter, the then Labour spokesperson on constitutional matters, Deputy Howlin, and Sinn FÃ©in's spokesperson, Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in, on agreed terms of reference.  The launch of this committee was the culmination of a great deal of deliberation, discussion and agreement both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  From the start, I emphasised very clearly the absolute need to deepen consensus on the matter.  There was constructive dialogue, deliberation and work among all committee members.  The committee had a very tight timeframe to report back to the Oireachtas, and it quite rightly sought extensions on several occasions to continue its work.</p><p> The terms of reference of the committee did not confine its deliberations to Oireachtas Members.  Provision was made for both oral and written submissions to the committee to ensure an input from people working outside the Oireachtas.  Current Ministers including Deputies Noonan, Fitzgerald, Shatter and Howlin were members of the committee, as well as other Members who are now retired.  All contributed to an area of significant complexity, as was evident from those outside groups that presented to the committee.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, earlier paid tribute to the chairman of the joint committee, Ms Mary O'Rourke.  I want to pay tribute to all committee members for their enthusiasm and diligence, as well as their commitment to ensuring the best possible protection for our children in this State.</p><p> I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and the holding of the referendum in early November.  Fianna FÃ¡il will be strong advocates of this amendment.  I also want to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Barry Andrews, who did enormous and positive work in contributing to this proposed amendment.</p></speech>

I passionately believe that we as legislators have an obligation to protect that precious place that is childhood.  In the past we failed collectively as a society.  Now is our chance to rectify that and stand united in this effort.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work of the late Ms Mary Rafferty who, in 1999, brought to our screens the horror of what so many of our children went through in industrial schools.  Her programme, &quot;States of Fear&quot;, led to widespread horror at the depth of abuse, both physical and emotional, that some of our citizens were put through.  Last year, I had the honour of presenting Ms Christine Buckley, one such survivor of this abuse, with the Labour Party's Evelyn Owens award.  Mary Rafferty's follow-up programme in 2002, &quot;Cardinal Secrets&quot;, then documented how those in leadership roles failed to investigate or deal with complaints of abuse.  However, what is equally distressing is how it also detailed the then political establishment's failure to protect those in the State's care.</p><p>  Let us never be found guilty of such failings again.  Let us work together in protecting children.  Many issues will divide us in this House but this is not one of them.  I include in that reference the children currently housed in direct provision centres as their parents await decisions on asylum applications.  They too need protection and I hope the Minister will ensure adequate safeguards are in place so that in 15 years' time we do not see similar horrific scenes on our televisions about abuse.</p><p>  The move by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to put in place legal requirements on mandatory reporting through the upcoming Children First legislation is most welcome, as is the imminent creation of a national children and family support agency.  Alone, however, these moves are not enough.  We need a cultural shift in which children are put at the heart of our social agenda.  This referendum is the beginning in creating that dialogue as it sets down a legal minimum standard.  The Constitution needs to be amended so that there is a general recognition and affirmation of the rights of the child.  We need to ensure there is provision for the State to intervene in those very rare cases in which a child's parents have failed to protect him or her.  We need the Constitution to treat all children equally regardless of whether their parents are married.  We need to be certain that when proceedings affect children, their best interests are paramount in achieving a resolution.</p><p>Finally, we need to ensure that the views of children are sought and considered in any proceedings affecting them.</p><p><br /> Last week I wrote a column for <i>thejournal.ie</i>about the long road this referendum has taken.  Since 2007 there have been three different wordings proposed for a possible constitutional amendment.  The wording before us tonight is the fourth such proposal.  We have spent the last decade trying to make this amendment perfect.  In using the term &quot;we&quot; I am referring to all of my colleagues in all political parties and those not in any party who have served the people during the past ten years.</p><p><br /> In 2007 the then Minister of State with responsibility for children proposed that Article 42.5 of the Constitution be deleted and replaced with a new article that affirmed the &quot;natural and imprescriptible rights of all children&quot;.  Later that year the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established to agree an all-party consensus.  This committee met 62 times over a period of 27 months and produced three reports.  The final of these reports, in 2010, proposed different wording to strengthen children's constitutional rights.  More recently, in 2011, a third wording was agreed but never formally published by the Minister, who had been appointed in 2008.  However, with the arrival of the troika and the change of Government in 2011 this issue was sidetracked and the task to put this to bed fell to the new Government and the new Minister.</p><p><br /> It is clear that before we set out to take on this challenge a significant amount of work had already been done on this issue and that should be acknowledged.  Given the care that was shown by previous officeholders and the work that has been done by this Government and the last Government, we prioritised this measure as a stand-alone referendum to ensure that the debate could be clear and focused.  It was also decided to hold the referendum on a Saturday to give maximum opportunity to all citizens to have their voices heard.  It is crucial that those voting for the first time have the chance to help to bury the painful legacy of the past and to make history for our children.</p><p><br /> I am honoured to serve on the Labour Party's campaign committee on this issue alongside my colleagues, Deputies White and Conway and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch.  I look forward to working with those from all sides of the House to get this referendum passed.  I hope that we will continue the debate on children's rights and child protection indefinitely in order that we ensure that we protect childhood for everyone.  My long-term hope is that, as legislators, we can create a culture of listening and that children's views can to be taken into account in all aspects of their lives.  This amendment empowers Members to draft and pass legislation to copper-fasten the rights of the child and mop up the anomalies in our law.  I look forward to working with everyone here as well as the NGO sector to continue the advancement of children's rights in future.  Childhood is precious and I am proud to be a part of the political system that has finally woken up to this fact.</p></speech>

Her work has introduced measures for the recognition of children, in particular the referendum on the 31st amendment of the Constitution.  This was promised but not delivered by the last Government but has been accomplished by this Government and that is important.  The rights and protection of children under our Constitution must be of paramount importance.  I emphasise that I believe these rights extend to the unborn as well.  I have made my position clear in respect of any attempt to introduce abortion to this country, a measure to which I am totally opposed.  The recognition of children as individuals with individual rights is a significant step forward in the creation of a society based on equality for all.  Although the amendment, which has been so carefully worded, will not be the cure-all sought at the most extreme level of expectation, it will go a long way towards it.  We are now presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our children that will resonate for years to come.  That we do so under the cloud of the revelations of terrible abuse, which has shocked our nation to the core, is a strong incentive, if one were needed, to ensure that childhood is protected in every possible way.</p><p>  While idealistic aspirations are often at odds with reality, I am confident that the Government will do its utmost to ensure that the optimum protection and respect will be accorded to children in the State.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will direct and underpin the actions of the courts in interpreting the constitutional provision now under consideration which the electorate will have the right to accept or reject on 10 November.</p><p>  Given the influences that children are subjected to in the 21st century, not the least of which are social networks, it is essential that any provision for their protection goes beyond the historical and somewhat narrow provisions.  The issues faced by young people today could not possibly have been envisaged under the provision of the 1937 Constitution.  Any amendment to the Constitution is likely to remain in place for a long time and, as such, must be far-sighted.  While I am aware that the amendment does and must provide for the adoption of the children of married parents, this area is fraught with pitfalls.  Like any other provision, there is a danger that bureaucracy and opportunity could lead in the long term to the unjust suffering of children and their parents, rather than providing the desired protection.</p><p>  Let us consider the position in the United Kingdom.  The system of so-called child protection there has led to accusations of secret family courts, reporting restrictions and child care scandals.  The heart-breaking reality is that reported excessive zeal by social services is leading to children being removed from parental care in situations where no abuse or neglect has taken place.  Parents are often afraid to take their children to hospital following an accident in case they are accused of deliberately harming a child.  This situation arises in all socioeconomic groupings of people and money and educational or professional status are no protection in these areas.  Last week the adoption of a baby boy, whose parents were accused of battering him leading to broken bones, was halted as evidence of congenital rickets and a vitamin D deficiency was presented.  After a three year battle the parents of the child have finally been given the chance to get their son back.  They are the lucky ones.  Records in the UK show numerous cases of supposed child abuse leading to children being removed from their parents and put up for adoption.  Even if the supposed abuse has been proven to be false, the children are not returned in many cases because adoptions have gone ahead and cannot be undone.  In another case highlighted last year a mother lost her son and daughter, both under the age of 12 years.  She was not prosecuted for any kind of abuse and had committed no crime.  She does not smoke, drink or take drugs and does not suffer from mental illness.  She was described as a kind and loving mother.  However, because of psychological vulnerability during a time of stress the social services decided that the children were at risk of significant harm.  These cases are only the tip of the iceberg.  It is important at this juncture when legislation and constitutional amendment will make provision for our children's health, happiness and essential rights, that bureaucracy does not develop in a way that, in the long term, will work against the very ideals that we seek to achieve.</p><p>  It is admirable that this Government has prioritised the protection of children and has, under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, done more to advance this legislation and the setting of a date for the children's rights referendum than all the talk of the last Government.</p><p>I am also confident that, in co-operation with her Cabinet colleagues, she can ensure that children are given special protection that will keep them safe, from both abuse and perceived abuse.</p><p> In tandem with children's rights, parents must have confidence that, in looking after their children to the best of their ability, they too will be protected.  I never want to see headlines such as &quot;Social Services took my Child&quot; and &quot;Child Care Scandals&quot; in this country.  The most basic right is that a child will, except in the most extreme cases, be entitled to know, love and be brought up by his or her own parents.  We can say that this is obvious and that any provision will only be in respect of proven and threatening cases, yet if we look at the issue of the introduction of divorce in Ireland, the initial thinking of everyone was that it would only apply in the Irish context to the most extreme situations.  However, since 2006, 90,000 divorces were obtained in this country.  This is a considerable number.  Abortion legislation in the UK and other countries was enacted initially with strict provisions.  These have been watered down over years to the current position where abortion on demand, indeed, on the most flimsy of pretexts, is very much the norm, and we never want to see it introduced here in this country.</p><p> This brings me on to another important issue, which perhaps comes under the Minister for Justice and Equality's remit, that is, cyber-bullying.  We must bring forward legislation to stop electronic bullying or intimidation through the Internet.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It is a new phenomenon and a 21st century issue.  Technology has now made it easier for bullies to get away with it and we must direct schools and IT literate persons to adopt policies prohibiting cyber-bullying.  Children or young adults can go online to create a cyber-personality for themselves by posting messages, videos, their interests and likes and dislikes on sites, and it is cheaper than texting.  Also, it is anonymous.  Indeed, it can cast decent people in a poor light.  This is also an issue that needs to be addressed and no doubt the Cabinet will do so during the term of this Government.</p><p> Our children are our future.  It is up to us to ensure that they are protected and that they can enjoy the childhood they deserve with loving families around them.  Good child care facilities are central pillars in our society.  The Minister is committed to prioritising the delivery of quality community child care, paid parental leave and improved direct child care payments to families.</p><p> Community care facilities need to be supported.  I had the pleasure of accompanying Deputy Fitzgerald when she visited the midlands - Longford, Athlone and Mullingar, and, indeed, many small villages in between - last year when she became Minister.  It probably reminded her of the Seanad campaign she undertook with me a number of years ago.  She got a great insight into how communities gel and how they look after and support community child care facilities.  It is important that such child care facilities are supported 100%.  No doubt we have the Minister in place who will battle extremely hard to ensure there are budgets for those facilities.</p><p> In a nutshell, this is an important piece of legislation.  It will foster a new attitude to children and reform the adoption laws and, indeed, support families and protect children and make them visible, and ensure decisions for children in their best interests.  I thank the Minister sincerely for bringing forward this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.884" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600048#VV00200"><p>Like other Members, I welcome the publication of the proposed wording of this amendment to the Constitution.  It has taken 20 years, 17 major reports into child-protection failings and repeated promises from successive Governments to get this far.</p><p>  As the House will be aware, Irish society has fundamentally changed since the Constitution was first written and I welcome this proposed reform.  Hopefully, it will ensure, for the first time ever, that the State will recognise the rights of children as individuals and not only as part of a family.  It is extremely important that the child can be recognised as a full citizen of the State, within and separate from the family.</p><p>  While the wording of the Government's proposed amendment is not exactly in line with what was agreed at the cross-party Oireachtas joint committee, I welcome that it goes a long way to achieve the committee's shared objectives.</p><p>  The question facing us, as legislators, is whether the final wording of the amendment be strong enough to ensure that it will protect all the children in the State from official neglect and abuse.  We all hope that it will become the keystone of one of the most important commitments laid out in the 1916 Proclamation of which other Members spoke, to &quot;cherish all the children of the nation equally&quot;, and ensure that becomes a reality.</p><p>  When I first came into this House a number of years ago, I took part in discussions on legislation on children with special needs.  The aspiration of those of us who took part in that debate and all the different groups that came in was that the legislation would pave the way to improve matters for children with special needs and their parents.  One of the most important points we made at the time was that they would only be aspirations unless the Government followed through with resources and supports for those families and, unfortunately, many families have been left in the situation where the child has been left without those supports.  It is important that we have these rights written in the Constitution but unless they are written in stone and the supports are in place, we fail children once again.</p><p>  Later we will discuss other children, those in the institutions etc., who we failed in the past and I welcome the fact that we will have another opportunity to reflect on that.  We in this House would all accept that we failed many of those children in the past, we are failing children at present and the important point coming out of this is that we must not fail children in the future.</p><p>  The amendment is designed to ensure that the interests of the child will be paramount in any court proceedings taken by the State relating to child protection, adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  While it is a welcome development to enshrine this in the Constitution, the Government must place the welfare of children to the forefront of their minds and review their harsh cuts to social services and overall austerity measures, which are detrimental to the well-being of vast numbers of children across the State.</p><p>  Recent figures from the CSO's &quot;Survey on Income and Living Conditions&quot; show that more than 200,000 children across the country are living in poverty.  This is an increase of 30,000 from two years ago.  This is happening under the Government's watch - 30,000 extra children in poverty.  Conditions can be linked directly to the decision to turn private debt into sovereign debt.  It is unacceptable that the Government is standing idly by while thousands of children live in poverty, and this report suggests that the number is rapidly increasing.</p><p>  While the Government proposes to introduce more harsh austerity measures, including cutbacks on social welfare, education and health which impact on the well-being of children, one in four between the ages of 12 to 17 is living below the poverty line according to the CSO.</p><p>  The CSO report also states that if social welfare allowances were excluded from the survey, 38% of households nationwide would be at risk of poverty.  This clearly shows the importance of welfare schemes and transfers in protecting families from the poverty trap.  I know at first-hand the number of families who are struggling to make ends meet at the end of the week in the current atmosphere of drastic cuts on social spending and tax increases which are affecting the most vulnerable.</p><p>People are already at breaking point trying to pay household charges, yet we see major residential energy price increases.  This will inevitably see more families dragged further into fuel poverty where they will have to choose between paying for basic household items or living in a home that is heated.  It was only the relatively mild winter we had last year that saved many people from the dangers of fuel poverty, but the concern is that fuel poverty will happen.  While the Government is focusing on legislating to protect children, it must also ensure that its policies do not endanger the well-being of children by pushing their families further into poverty.</p><p><br /> In the same week the wording to the amendment was published, the Irish Refugee Council published a report entitled: State Sanctioned Child Poverty and Exclusion.  The report dealt with the shocking conditions and treatment that children of asylum seekers now face.  It highlighted in shocking detail the major overcrowding issue in direct provision centres in which asylum seekers are accommodated and indicated that children staying in them are at serious risk of malnourishment.  There are currently 5,098 people in State-provided direct provision centres and over one-third of these, 1,789, are children.  Some were born in or have lived their whole lives in Ireland, as processing for asylum seekers takes anywhere from one to seven years.  Due to overcrowding issues, these centres pose a risk to the well-being of children.</p><p><br /> According to a report from the special rapporteur for children, Geoffrey Shannon, there is a &quot;real risk&quot; of child abuse in direct provision centres because single parents and their children sometimes have to share a room with strangers.  In addition, sometimes the families of teenage children of opposite genders are required to share one room.  Given the history of child abuse in State run institutions here, the Government</p><p>should tackle this problem immediately to ensure that no child, no matter its nationality, is under threat while in State care.  The State is also failing to provide many families with enough nutritious food.  The report states:<blockquote> Lack of appropriate food and the inability of parents to provide food for their children is a common theme in residents' lives in direct provision.  The result of the inadequate provision of food has been: instances of malnutrition among children and expectant mothers, ill-health related to diet among babies and young children, weight loss among children, hunger among adults (as a result of family rationing) and chronic gastric illness among children of all ages.</blockquote>This is unacceptable.  It reads like a description of the conditions from which many of these families were trying to escape.  I agree with the recommendations of the Irish Refugee Council's report, which call for an independent inquiry into the long list of complaints, grievances and child protection issues reported by residents and children of the State-run direct provision centres for asylum seekers.</p><p><br /> Passing this referendum will not ensure that children are fully protected in our society.  The Government also needs to protect children whose well-being is threatened by socioeconomic factors and those children in the care of the State.  While the amendment to the Constitution is welcome, it will not change that fact that Government policies continue to place thousands of children at risk every day.  Deputy Flanagan spoke earlier about the Children's Rights Alliance and a child-centred approach that would allow the thousands of children in State care the opportunity of a loving and stable family home and about ensuring that judges listen to children when a decision is to be made in a court or family case.  We have the opportunity now to move beyond child abuse.</p><p><br /> I look forward to the referendum and to discussing the issues on the doorsteps with constituents.  People should vote &quot;Yes&quot; on this.  I do not agree with those in the &quot;No&quot; camp on this, although I accept the view that we could make stronger recommendations.  Perhaps we should be moving towards not only poverty-proofing many policies but towards child-proofing them.  I look forward to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs being the champion of this and hope she will ensure that legislation coming before the House will be child-proofed so as to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes made by society, the State and the Government with regard to children in the past.</p><p><br /> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and I hope to speak later on tonight on the issue of the hurt still being created in people's lives due to our failure to legislate with regard to those hurt in the past.  I hope and pray - not something I do very often - that we do not return to this in 20 years and find families and children in the same situation we have had in the past.  This amendment is a genuine effort by the Minister, the Government and those who sat on the committee to deliver for children.  Hopefully, we have it right this time.</p></speech>

Over past years, we have let down the children of Ireland and have allowed children's lives be ruined and destroyed.  The delay in bringing forward a referendum on children's rights has resulted in many children facing danger, abuse and sometimes death.  Our TÃ¡naiste was right when he stated that some of the darkest moments in our past are a direct consequence of ignoring children's interests and their rights to be cared for and protected.</p><p>  It is over 20 years since Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness called for a referendum to enshrine the rights of children in our Constitution.  Many academics and children advocates also pleaded with previous Governments for a referendum.  This Government is listening and reacting and it seeks to protect our young and vulnerable.  I am proud to be part of this Government, a Government which cares and which will listen to children and give a voice to them in our Constitution.  This Government appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who has done Trojan work to bring this referendum to the people.  The referendum proposes to put the child at the centre of Bunreacht na hÃireann.  It is a statement of how we value and cherish the children of our State.  The majority of parents look after their children.  This referendum is not about them, but about the parents who do not nurture and protect their children.</p><p>  During my years as a teacher and school principal, I attended many teacher conferences, meetings and staff meetings at which many teachers expressed concern for children in their care.  Some arrived at school unwashed, some arrived hungry and some arrived as vacant, exhausted shells.  Indeed, some arrived as all of these with all life and sparkle drained from them.  This referendum will facilitate those cases where children are abused or neglected within their families.  It will allow the State to step in more quickly to protect them.  This is a very welcome development.</p><p>  During my work in the education sector, I met children who were fostered and their foster parents.  It was plain to see that these children were adored, cherished and loved.  However, there was something missing, a piece of the jigsaw lost.  They did not fully belong and there was an endless fear that the dream would end soon and that the child would have to leave.  Often, the real heartbreak for the foster parents was the knowledge of the situation to which the child would return. </p><p>They had to watch the child they adored, cherished and loved return to parents who neglected, abused and dismissed the child.  Some of these parents were incapable of looking after themselves due to problems with drink, drugs or mental illness.  Forthcoming legislation will allow the children of married parents to be adopted.  More than 1,600 children are currently living in institutions or with foster parents because of the value placed on the family in our Constitution.  We need to make it clear that the new Article 42A of the Constitution still acknowledges that the best place for the child is in the family home.  This is the case in the majority of instances.  If this referendum is passed, children will have recognised rights and the safety and welfare of children will be at the centre of decision-making.  The inclusion of the proposed Article 42A in the Constitution will mean that the family will have to share its pedestal with children.  A balancing act will have to be performed.  This is only right and proper.  Hillary Clinton has said that "every child needs a champion".  On 10 November next, we should all become champions for our sons and daughters and for those children who are seen by few and heard by even fewer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.889" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1053" speakername="Anthony Lawlor" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600050#XX00200"><p>Approximately six weeks ago, my staff made an appointment for a woman to come to visit me.  I thought it was a routine case of someone looking for assistance with an application for disability allowance.  When the woman sat down in front of me, I heard the horrific tale of how her daughter was abused approximately 25 years ago.  As a result of this abuse, her daughter started to look inward and become depressed.  She turned to alcohol and currently resides in the psychiatric ward in Naas hospital.  As I listened to the details of what happened to this young girl, it struck me that the abuse, which was a physical and traumatic experience at the time, has affected her ever since.  Her entire life has been destroyed as a result of half an hour's bad experience with someone she trusted.  That is why I feel that the constitutional amendment we are putting before the people is so important.  We have to protect people like this young woman, who trusted someone but was abused by that person.  We can do something to alleviate the sorts of problems that might be encountered by children in the future.  The woman in this case will suffer for the rest of her life, sadly, but many others can be saved if we agree to amend the Constitution as proposed in this legislation.  The pain of abuse will be taken from them.</p><p>  I emphasise that we are talking about a small number of people.  Virtually all children live in loving and caring families.  When I researched this issue, I learned that one third of young children in foster care are being looked after by relatives.  During the summer, I heard that the sister of a woman who had ended up in psychiatric care took on the responsibility of looking after her four children.  The problem I dealt with was in ensuring the State could give this family as much assistance as possible.  The broader family unit stepped in to help the mother when she required such assistance.  I hope the four children will be back with their mother shortly when she has herself sorted out.  We have a duty to ensure that sort of care and feeling is reflected in our Constitution.</p><p>  The Minister was right when she said that this amendment, although helpful now, will be of particular benefit to future generations.  It will help us to prevent the small number of abusive people in society from abusing children.  It will allow us to help children as much as possible. That is why I warmly welcome the Bill before the House, which has been in fermentation for a long period of time.  One of the first committees to examine this issue and produce a report on it was established 20 years ago.  I must say that great work was done by former colleagues of the Deputies on the other side of the House, including Mary O'Rourke and Barry Andrews.  In 2007, a joint committee proposed many of the ideas that have been taken on board by the Minister in proposing this amendment to the Constitution.  It is sad that it took so long, but by reading those reports and reflecting on their positive aspects, I think we have got it right.</p><p>  When this proposal was being drawn up, great consideration was given to the central role the family plays in a child's life.  We should try to keep every child in his or her family, where possible.  I welcome the adoption Bill that is associated with this proposal.  According to an information document on that Bill which I have read, the policies and practices of those who are working with children now, including HSE professionals like care workers and social workers, place a focus on keeping the child in the family to the greatest extent possible.  Those professionals provide support to parents as well.  It is important that the State gives as much assistance as possible to those who have difficulty with the skill of parenting.  The last thing anyone wants to do is to remove a child from its family.  I mentioned earlier that the broader family often comes to the help of young children.</p><p>  I am glad that foster families are being recognised.  Many children go into foster care for short periods of time - perhaps two or three months.  It does not help children to be moved from one foster family to another.  Stability, in its various forms, is the most important thing for a young person as he or she is growing up.  Many couples who have children of their own are willing to foster another child.  Some of them would love to be able to adopt that child if his or her biological family is not capable of looking after him or her.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the legislation will give a foster parent who has cared for a child for five, six or seven years an opportunity to adopt that child.  I am also pleased that the voice of the child is being heard.  The Minister mentioned that many of the adoptions taking place within foster families involve children of 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  They are mature at that stage.  They are able to make their own decisions and life choices.  They are allowed to vote at 18.  They are allowed to consent to have sex at 16.  It is disappointing that these young people have not been heard before now when they have said they want their futures to be with their foster families.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister on the work she has done so far to prepare for the referendum.  I am delighted that there is cross-party support for the proposal.  I look forward to canvassing for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on 10 November next.</p></speech>

I am always appreciative of speaking time in this House but I am particularly grateful to be able to speak today on an issue that is particularly close to my heart.  The cornerstone of any democracy is its constitution.  Equality should be the foundation of our democracy.  As a result of this legislation, we will finally give our children the protection of our Constitution.  I do not think anybody can object to that.  Over 30 years have passed since the then Senator Mary Robinson first expressed the need for constitutional change for children.  In the intervening period, a series of official reports have made the case for strengthening children's rights at constitutional level.</p><p>These include the Kilkenny incest report in 1993; the Constitutional Review Group in 1996; the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in 2010; international authorities such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 1998 and again in 2006; and, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in 2007 and more recently in 2011.  As evidenced by the marches in support of victims of child abuse, the public appetite of the people for change is also clear.</p><p> It has taken this Government to have to courage to acknowledge the State's responsibility to children.  Upon taking office, the Government immediately made significant inroads into improving Ireland's child welfare and protection systems with the appointment of a senior Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which were big and important steps.  We have already seen momentum, with child protection reforms taking place, with the Child and Family Support Agency and the legislation on Children First, the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill.  All mark significant progress in the direction of Ireland's commitment to improving child protection and welfare and set Ireland on course to meeting the recommendations set out by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's in 2006.</p><p> We need laws that will protect children from harm and give them status as individuals.  Now, with the insertion of explicit children's rights into the Constitution, which had been mooted for a long time, the Fine Gael-Labour Government is keeping the promise to hold such a referendum, a children's referendum.  We will be voting to insert an article into the Constitution, as the Taoiseach said, &quot;dedicated entirely to children as individuals, as citizens in their own right&quot;.  For the first time in the history of the State, children will become more than just the property of their parents.</p><p> I would like to compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her Department on their work in getting this legislation ready.  She took time to get it right and it has been noticeable that the response to the wording from all corners of the spectrum has been welcoming, including from the Opposition.  We have had a plethora of reports highlighting the neglect, abuse and exploitation when children's voices were silenced and their best interests ignored.  Those working with and for children agree that constitutional change is required to ensure that children are fully protected in society and that their rights are taken into account in decisions made about their lives.</p><p> Why do we need a constitutional amendment to strengthen the rights of children?  At a minimum, the express and individual rights for children at constitutional level will reflect the value we place on our children in society and ensure that they are the focus in budgetary, political, administrative, legislative and other decisions affecting them.  The lack of recognition of the individual rights of the child has led to some poor judicial decisions affecting children.  Unlike cases involving children of unmarried parents, in cases involving children of marital families, due to the constitutional presumption in favour of the family under Article 41, no independent investigation can be undertaken as to the child's best interests in the court's decision making unless the exceptional circumstances outlined prevail.  A  key example of this is the &quot;Baby Anne&quot; case.</p><p> The Constitution allows discrimination to persist between children based on the marital status of their parents, with the strength of the rights afforded to children reliant on whether their parents are married or unmarried. The &quot;Baby Anne&quot; case is also a relevant example in this regard and shows how the rigid judicial interpretation of Articles 41 and 42 has impinged upon the effective operation of our child protection, care and adoption systems.</p><p> Children's rights are human rights, with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to the young.  With this referendum, we are acknowledging the move towards viewing child protection through the lens of children's rights, indeed, through a human rights lens.  The field of children's rights spans the fields of law, politics, religion, and morality.  Children in Ireland, as in many other European countries, were historically sidelined in society.  The State on its foundation in 1922 inherited a 1908 Act that was to be the main instrument for child protection for most of the 20th century until the enactment of the Child Care Act 1991.  The failure to amend and overhaul that legislation for more than 80 years speaks eloquently of how children were viewed.</p><p> The 1937 Constitution largely saw children in the context of the family, which was interpreted to mean only the marital family.  Children's rights were not considered.  That their voices were not heard, that their family ties were not respected, is now well recognised.  The lack of recognition and complete disregard for the human rights of children and young people inevitably led to a situation where policy focused on protecting the income of the institution, a State that did little or nothing to increase support to families in need.</p><p> Childhood is a precious time and does not last very long.  Children must be protected and their rights promoted to ensure they are consistently treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.  The wording to be inserted into the Constitution is crucial to its success as it balances the rights of children with those of their parents.  Most significantly, the best interests of the child are to be the first and paramount consideration in the resolution of all disputes concerning the guardianship, adoption, custody, care or upbringing of a child.  Making children visible in the Constitution will help to foster a new legal landscape for children in Ireland.</p><p> Perhaps the greatest recent adjudication on the proposed amendment came from Ms Anne Rennison, who over 25 years has fostered six children long-term and 20 short-term.  She said on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; in recent days that the referendum will acknowledge the rights of children and hear the voice of children, the children who in the past and to this day are &quot;no longer safe&quot; in our society.  This is a chilling and tragic indictment of the way we have approached matters in the past.  In conclusion, if this amendment can prevent one more crime against a child, if it can make one child's life safe, if it can make one family more complete, then this House will have done a good day's work.</p></speech>

As was said, the amendment has been welcomed across the board and among the wider public, rightly so.  This is a tribute to the work the Minister has done to put together wording that is acceptable to everybody, which is as it should be.  There is no doubt the Irish people will on 10 November give the go-ahead to the amendment of the Constitution.  I would imagine there will be virtually unanimous support across the country in regard to protecting the rights of children and enshrining this in our Constitution.</p><p>  As the Minister said in her contribution yesterday, it has been a very long time coming, perhaps too long.  On 11 November, the work will really begin for those in the Oireachtas because there is no doubt the amendment will be passed and, when it is, we will have a job to do.  We need to make sure legislation reflects fully and builds on the amendment, and strengthens the protections for children and the rights of children into the future.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment is the legal minimum standard.  The Adoption (Amendment) Bill just published will go some way to enshrining those rights in regard to adoption and the rights of children but when we introduce other legislation, we need to go further.  There are proposals to put child protection on a legislative basis and we need to make sure that progresses as quickly as possible.  We also need a children Bill to be published that will fully enshrine and build further on the rights of children.  Comprehensive legislation on that basis will be vital for us.</p><p>  The wording of the amendment states that rights &quot;shall&quot; be enshrined, which is very important.  I pay tribute to the Minister for ensuring the word &quot;shall&quot; is included because it means we cannot duck our responsibility in this House and we will have to ensure we bring forward the legislation to protect the rights of children.  The fact the wording reflects the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is also important and builds this into the Constitution.  This can only strengthen the Constitution and make it better for all citizens, children in particular.</p><p>  The legislation we introduce after the referendum must ensure the best interests of children are reflected in all proceedings in regard to children, whether administrative or judicial, so children are foremost in people's minds when they make these decisions.  The views of children should be considered in any judicial proceedings.  I know that in some jurisdictions children are given legal representation with regard to adoption and other matters concerning them.  That is something we should put in place here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.897" nospeaker="true" time="18:35:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald on Tuesday, 26 September 2012:

That DÃ¡il Ãireann:

notes that this motion has been drawn up with a survivor centred ethos;

agrees with the State&#8217;s position, as articulated in DÃ¡il Ãireann in February 2002, that abuse occurred in the Magdalene Laundries, that the abuse was an appalling breach of trust and that

the victims of that abuse suffered and continue to suffer greatly; 

acknowledges the hurt and hardship caused by the exclusion of survivors of the Magdalene Laundries from the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme;

acknowledges that the Magdalene survivor population is predominantly aging and elderly;

acknowledges that survivor testimony records that women were made to work without pay, were kept behind locked doors and returned by gardaÃ­ if they attempted to escape;

welcomes the establishment of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Magdalene Laundries to clarify any State interaction with the Magdalene Laundries and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction;

notes the Irish Human Rights Commission document entitled Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the &#8220;Magdalene Laundries&#8221;;

notes the UN Committee Against Torture&#8217;s recommendations on the Magdalene Laundries, its insistence that the State ensure that survivors obtain redress and its grave concern at the failure by the State to institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations into the allegations of ill-treatment of the women;

further welcomes the public statement of June 2011 by four religious congregations which ran ten Magdalene Laundries expressing a willingness to bring greater clarity, understanding, healing and justice in the interests of all the women involved; 

further acknowledges that there is growing evidence of the State: 

&#8212; sending women and girls to the Magdalene Laundries;

&#8212; providing the religious orders with direct and indirect financial support; and

&#8212; failing to supervise the religious orders&#8217; operation of the Magdalene Laundries;

considers most serious the allegations of forced labour in the Magdalene Laundries, noting the incarceration and use of women and children as workers without pay would constitute forced labour under the 1930 Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation, which Ireland ratified in 1931, and accepts that the rejection and prohibition of slavery is a peremptory norm of international law; 

acknowledges the need for immediate and meaningful discussion on an apology and redress; 

commits to providing immediate funding for, and implementation of, a helpline for the survivors of the Magdalene Laundries;

commits to supporting survivors in accessing pensions that reflect their years of work in the Magdalene Laundries; and 

commits to an open and meaningful debate on the issue of an apology, redress and restorative justice measures once the Inter-Departmental Committee has reported.

Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:To delete all words after &#8220;DÃ¡il Ãireann&#8221; and substitute the following:

&#8220;acknowledges that the untold story of those women who were in Magdalene laundries needs to be listened to with compassion and the facts about the Magdalene laundries need to be established and made public;

is conscious of the need to respect the rights of all concerned;

notes that the Irish Human Rights Commission document entitled &#8216;Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the &#8220;Magdalene Laundries'&quot; in November 2010 had recommended in the context of a mechanism to investigate matters that:

&#8212; &#8216;such a mechanism should first examine the extent of the State&#8217;s involvement in and responsibility for:&#8212; the girls and women entering the laundries;

&#8212; the conditions in the laundries;

&#8212; the manner in which girls and women left the laundries; and

&#8212; end-of-life issues for those who remained&#8217;;welcomes the fact that this Government, shortly after taking office in 2011, decided to establish an interdepartmental committee on Magdalene laundries, chaired by an independent person, to establish the facts of State involvement in Magdalene laundries;

welcomes the fact that the religious congregations who ran the Magdalene laundries, those individuals who were in Magdalene laundries and their advocacy and representative groups have all engaged with the committee;

notes that Senator Martin McAleese, chairman of the committee, has recently advised that:&#8212; the committee has made excellent progress despite the considerable challenges faced;

and

&#8212; a significant level of information and documentation has been identified; however, relevant records continue to be identified by Government Departments and State agencies and the committee also continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups, with a submission in excess of over 100 pages only received from one such group as recently as 15 August 2012;agrees that it would be wrong for the committee to conclude its work without examining the additional material and welcomes the excellent progress made by the committee and the statement that the committee intends to present a substantial final report as soon as possible and at the latest before the end of this year; and

commits to an open and meaningful response once the interdepartmental committee has reported.&#8221; - (Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch).</p></speech>

I signed my name to it because what else could one do.  These people need justice and they need it before it is too late.  The longer we wait, the less likely it is that they will get justice.</p><p>  I started reading the report produced by Justice for Magdalenes and I must say it is very hard work to read it.  If it is hard work to read the report, it must have been absolute hell to exist as those people were forced to exist.  I consider myself very lucky that myself and my wife were not born 30 years earlier than we were because, given that my two children were born outside wedlock, my wife would probably have been put in care and my children taken away from me.  I would probably have ended up in England and everyone would have ended up miserable.  If one imagines oneself in that position and asks if one deserves justice, the answer is yes, of course.</p><p>  One particular story in the report stood out.  Often mothers and daughters were in the same facility and in one case, a mother was in the same chapel as her daughter, week after week but she was not told it was her daughter.  I am trying to understand how anyone could be so cruel as to do that to someone.  It is fairly obvious it was cruel.  It was fairly obvious to Deputy Shatter in December 2009 that it was wrong, when he said there was &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; that there was State complicity in the Magdalene laundries.  That is still true today and he needs to act on it today.</p></speech>

It is a register of the crimes committed by this State against women.  After reading the report, there can be no doubt that this was a deliberate social policy which was summed up in the report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor, which dealt with how the State handled births outside marriage.  A woman could be detained in a mother and baby home for a year if she had one child outside marriage.  If she had two children, she could be detained for two years and if she had any more, she could be detained for as long as the State deemed necessary.  The object was clearly defined thus: "...to regulate control according to individual requirements, or in the more degraded cases to segregate those who have become sources of evil, danger, and expense to the community."  How more horrendous could any sentence be?</p><p>  I read of one case where a girl was raped by her brother.  He was imprisoned for six years and she got life in a Magdalene laundry.  I also read of another woman, buried in Limerick, who spent 74 years in a laundry.  The report is a litany of degradation, imprisonment, violations of human rights and forced labour.  The evidence is irrefutable in this report.  The State was fully complicit in all of these activities through the capitation fees it paid on behalf of those who were on probation and sent to laundries.  It was complicit in the transferring of young women to the laundries from industrial schools.  There was no monitoring of the conditions in the laundries and the State fought against the application of the Factories Act, when it was introduced, to the laundries.  When the Act was applied, the State carried out no enforcement.  The State also interacted in the drawing up of the lucrative commercial contracts between the laundries and the Army, prison services and so forth.</p><p>  It is not good enough for the Government to say, &quot;wait, we will deal with it this year&quot;.  These people have already waited a lifetime.  Many of them cannot wait any more.  The UN Commission on Torture said over three months ago that this should have been dealt with.  This is an ageing population.  They deserve an apology now.  They deserve redress now.  I support the suggestion that these laundries were commercial enterprises and the reckonable service should be pensionable.  The money should be recovered in unpaid PAYE and PRSI contributions to foot the bill.  There should be no more excuses or delays.  This matter should be dealt with now.</p></speech>

The State is ultimately responsible for this.  The role of the religious orders and the church hierarchy is beyond question, in the way they used their twisted notions of morality to justify visiting appalling suffering, abuse and exploitation on tens of thousands women.  That is well known and beyond question.  However, it is the State that is ultimately responsible for the welfare of every citizen.  It is well documented that the State was directly and indirectly, through neglect and through turning a blind eye, responsible for allowing these horrors, this abuse, exploitation and enslavement to be inflicted on so many Irish women over decades.</p><p>  The State passed laws and took measures that directly underpinned the Magdalene laundry system.  The gardaÃ­ returned women who fled or escaped to these institutions.  The State provided direct and indirect financial support to the laundries and abdicated its duty of care to these women by failing to ensure that their human rights were vindicated.  All of this was done very deliberately by the State.  It essentially used the church and its institutions as a method of social control, for cynical economic and political reasons and for twisted notions of morality.  Against this context, it is shameful that this Government is continuing to delay giving these women the justice, acknowledgement and the compensation they deserve for the suffering they endured at the hands of the church and the State.  The Government has no excuse for further delay.  The survivors and victims have said they support the interdepartmental committee but it should not be used as an excuse to delay the apology and the redress that they deserve now.  The Government should give that to them tonight.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion.  This is not an issue on which the House should divide.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment and to allow this motion to be passed unanimously by the House.</p><p>  We must acknowledge that abuse occurred in Magdalene laundries.  The abuse was an appalling breach of trust and the victims of that abuse suffered, and continue to suffer, greatly.  We must acknowledge the hurt and the hardship caused by the exclusion of survivors of the Magdalene laundries from the residential institutions redress scheme.  We also need to recognise that the survivors are predominantly elderly.</p><p>  The survivor testimony itself records that women were made to work without pay, were kept behind locked doors and returned by gardaÃ­ if they attempted to escape.  The State had a role in this and we must acknowledge that there is now growing evidence that the State sent women and girls to the Magdalene laundries.  The State also provided the religious orders which ran the laundries with direct and indirect financial support.  It also failed abjectly to supervise the religious orders in the operation of the laundries.  On that basis I support the motion and again appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that everyone in the House must find it difficult to read the stories of the people concerned, the survivors.  The stark submission from the Magdalene group indicates that the State was involved in sending women and girls to the Magdalene laundries and ensuring that they remained there, in most cases without any statutory basis for doing so.  The State regarded the Magdalene laundries as an opportunity to deal with various social problems such illegitimacy, poverty, homelessness, disability, so-called eccentric behaviour, domestic and sexual abuse, youth crime and infanticide.  It failed to make its own provision for these problems and came to rely on the availability of the Magdalene institutions instead.</p><p> I find it harrowing also to note the timetable of events.  The Justice for Magdalenes group originally submitted its draft to the Government in July 2009.  It is three years since the Labour Party supported the redress scheme.  In December 2009 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform acknowledged that the State was complicit in referring women to Magdalene laundries.  In March 2011, when the Government came to power, the group submitted a restorative justice and reparation scheme to it, updating the scheme published in July 2009.  Fifteen months ago the UN Committee against Torture gave the State one year to obtain redress for survivors.  I find it difficult to credit the Minister of State's assertion last night that the call for an apology and a redress scheme was premature.  I accept that the wheels of democracy turn slowly but it was miraculous how quickly we were able to organise the bank bailout.  I accept Rome was not built in a day, but an immediate apology is required.</p></speech>

No one is capable of being an expert on every topic.  I feel comfortable informing myself to the best of my ability and forming a judgment, yet there are some topics, regardless of how much I read or how much research I do, that I feel I can never fully understand.  The Magdalene issue is one such topic.  Some facts are known and they are almost incomprehensible.  More than 30,000 women and girls were incarcerated in those institutions, enduring forced labour, brutal conditions and enforced confinement.  They lived with a cultural stigma that attached such deep shame that many begged to be sent to prison rather than to the laundries.</p><p><br />  As a representative for Galway West I thought it appropriate to read the following extract from the report of Justice for Magdalenes, which I re-read today.<blockquote>[T]he Mother Superior  of the convent operating the Magdalene Laundry in Galway in 1958 [said] that seventy per cent of the women in that Laundry were &#8220;unmarried mothers&#8221;.  [...] When asked whether a woman or girl could leave whenever she chose, the Mother Superior stated &#8220;No, we&#8217;re not as lenient as that.  The girl must have a suitable place to go.  [...] Some stay for life&#8221;.</blockquote>That the life of any person could be so flippantly treated, rights so casually abused and liberties so easily disregarded is horrifying.  When I was a member of Galway City Council the following motion was passed with unanimous support: &quot;That Galway City Council calls on the Government and the Catholic Church to (a) issue formal apologies for the abuse inflicted on women and young girls in the Magdalen Laundries and (b) establish a distinct redress scheme for all survivors.&quot;  I stand by those sentiments today.  They are the sentiments of the people of Galway.  The State cannot deny that it has a liability in the issue or that there was State complicity in the use of the laundries for those activities and that what was going on was known to the State in some fashion, at least enough to prove neglect and liability.</p><p><br />  I acknowledge the bravery and courage of those women who have campaigned for justice, not just for themselves but for others.  It cannot be easy.  The persistent reminder of the abuse they have suffered in the course of their campaign must be extremely difficult.  I accept the Government's request that Senator Martin McAleese and his committee be allowed finish their report so as to allow a full and proper debate.  I am told the report will be finished by the end of this year at the latest.  It is on that contention that I seek some satisfaction.  However, I warn that any delay beyond the end of the year would be utterly and completely unacceptable.</p></speech>

Recent decades have seen huge progress in Irish society in terms of assessing how the country's most vulnerable people were treated in past decades and an important part of that has been assessment of the circumstances of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries across the country.  Initially those institutions were designed as places of asylum for women and were found throughout Europe as well as in Canada and the United States.  However, by the early 20th century in Ireland, these centres had adopted a more prison-like regime, with enforced labour and long periods of silence.  Lest anyone think that these institutions belong to a dim and distant part of Ireland's past, the last Magdalene asylum closed in Waterford just 16 years ago in 1996.  Their presence was widely accepted although the residents of the institutions were rarely seen in public.  Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in, Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture all used the services of the laundries.  In her 2001 book on the subject, <i>Do Penance or Perish: A Study of Magdalene Asylums in Ireland</i>, Frances Finnegan suggests that it was the advent of the washing machine, as opposed to any moral outcry, that led to the demise of such institutions.  Survivors of the institutions report the prevalence of forced labour and the use of women and children as unpaid workers, all of which appear to contravene the 1930 Forced Labour Convention.</p><p><br />  The nation as a whole must reflect on the brutal treatment meted out to those women and the silence that surrounded the subject for many years.  Such an assessment must be carried out properly and deserves due consideration.  It is right and proper that the committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese is afforded until the end of the year to conclude its work and submit a final report.  Fifteen months ago the Government decided upon the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to consider the circumstances of the women and girls who lived in the institutions.  That was the correct decision to take as a first step to establishing the truth about what happened inside the walls of the institutions.  The proper course of action is that sufficient time is taken to produce the report.  After decades of silence, the very least we can do for the women and girls who lived in the institutions, often working for paltry or non-existent wages, is to give their cases the consideration they merit.  To rush the report would not provide justice to the women.  The time specified is not too long to allow for the production of such an important report, especially when one considers that the committee must review such institutions over a 90-year period and also that submissions by relevant representative groups were being made up to mid-August.  I endorse the Government's position on the report.  Senator McAleese and his colleagues on the interdepartmental committee must be afforded the necessary time to properly conduct the investigation and compile the results into a narrative that details the experience of the women.</p><p><br />  I note Deputy McDonald's statement that the women involved are ageing and are anxious to achieve closure on the issue, but to pre-empt the publication of such a report by making a decision in advance of its circulation would be wrong.  These forgotten women of Irish history, many of whom disappeared behind the high walls of those institutions for decades, deserve to have their stories told in a proper fashion and to have the matter explored properly in a way that respects their dignity while at the same time giving proper consideration to this important issue.</p></speech>

Just as we recall past glories and live off them, we cannot deny this part of our history, nor should we.  We must confront it, accept it as part of our story and deal with it.  While nobody should seek to shield those directly responsible, be they religious or lay, we cannot deny our culpability in that all of us have a collective guilt.  Our attitudes, silence and callous indifference all fed into the problem.  That is not for one moment to say that horrendous crimes were not committed by the people immediately involved in the institutions, but our collective guilt cannot be denied either.</p><p><br />  I understand the need for urgent action given the age and frailty of many of the victims.  I say to the Minister that our stance even in the interim, as of today and every day from now on, should be proactive in support of the women.  I presume it is, but it should be nothing short of fully proactive and helpful to the women, emotionally, psychologically, financially and in every practical way.  There is more than a <i>prima facie</i> case suggesting State involvement.</p><p>Last night's &quot;Prime Time&quot; provided the most recent assertion of the active use of the laundries as jails and the State's purchase of their services.  In itself, this meant complicity.  Nevertheless, it is worth waiting - although not indefinitely - for the interdepartmental report.  The interdepartmental committee has a prestigious chair in Senator McAleese, which lends it authority.  Its interim report would suggest it is being well co-operated with and that it is uncovering and collating evidence.  We know that <i>prima facie</i>evidence exists but the committee is bringing it together in an official report that has status.  I urge that the report should come out quickly and I ask the Minister to press for its publication at the earliest date possible.  I accept the point made about the frailty and age of those concerned and therefore the report should come out as soon as is humanly possible.  However, I side with the body of evidence that shows that although we should care immediately for the woman who, as victims, should now be cared for in every practical and conceivable way, the final redress should await the actual report.  This would turn the <i>prima facie</i>evidence into an actual commissioned report, with all the status that goes with that.  Then there must be real action, which should involve an apology and so forth.</p><p><br /> We all need this.  It will be good for the body politic, for society, for every player involved and for all of us in the country who are collectively guilty.  We need a truth and reconciliation process similar to the South African process that followed apartheid, a truth and reconciliation forum to be established to tell the Magdalene story.  It is a sordid part of our history.  We cannot romanticise our past and ignore this.  Only by looking holistically at our history will we benefit as a people and evolve into a better society with more humane principles and more proper values.</p><p><br /> I appeal to those who proposed the motion.  I commend Sinn FÃ©in on introducing it.  It is an excellent use of Private Members' time; that is my genuine belief.  Although I commend its introduction, I appeal to the Members to refrain from pre-empting the outcome of the report.  They should urge the earliest possible publication of the report and for all speed and all resources to be given to the committee.  I do not believe they should pre-empt the committee's final report.  It has a prestigious chair and because it is acting as an interdepartmental body, its report will be decisive and authoritative.  I appeal to Sinn FÃ©in to consider this, pull back the motion and accept the Government amendment on that basis.  We should move to have a truth and reconciliation commission after that report appears and should not wipe this history under the carpet.  It is too much a part of us to be ignored - a sad and dark part of us.</p></speech>

Although I agree broadly with our response and our amendment to it, what is glaringly obvious to me and, I assume, to every other Member of the House, is the omission of an apology.  I acknowledge the steps the Government has taken since last year's recommendation and I recognise and admire the work being undertaken by Senator Martin McAleese's interdepartmental committee, which was established to clarify the extent of State involvement in the laundries.  We certainly do not call for it to stop.  We want its work speeded up.  However, it is clear to me there is enough evidence of State involvement in the Magdalene laundries for the Government to issue an apology.</p><p><br />  A piece in <i>The Irish Times </i>today really struck me:<blockquote>No apology, no pension, no lost wages, no redress and no acknowledgment that what had happened to them was wrong.  A population of Irish women, aging and elderly, living at home and abroad, many vulnerable and marginalised, are all left waiting as time slips by.</blockquote>It is an indisputable fact that three years after the Justice for Magdalenes group circulated an apology and proposed a redress scheme for survivors of the laundries, 22 months after the Irish Human Rights Commission called for a statutory inquiry into the alleged abuses and the provision of redress in appropriate cases, and 15 months after the UN Committee against Torture obliged the State to ensure that within one year survivors would obtain redress, the women at the centre of this debate find themselves in exactly the same position as they were when it started.</p><p><br />  This week every Deputy and Senator in the Oireachtas received a redacted copy of the Justice for Magdalenes' recent principal submission to the interdepartmental committee investigating the State's involvement with the laundries.  This involvement documents overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of State complicity in the abuses experienced by young girls and women in these institutions.  I hope the pending final report on the issue by the interdepartmental committee will offer an even more complete picture of the involvement of this State.</p><p><br />  In the testimonies gathered, survivors have testified they could not leave the laundries, that doors were locked and windows inaccessible.  If they did try to leave they were returned by gardaÃ­.  Others decided not to try to escape because they knew the same fate awaited them.  They could not complain and, in most cases, they remarked there was no one to whom they could complain in any case.  Others begged to leave, often daily, but were always refused.  Every survivor has confirmed they were never paid, that no inspections were ever carried out and that no Government official ever came to check on them.  These women have been let down all their lives and I sincerely hope they will not be let down again.  I urge that the report of the interdepartmental committee be published with all haste and that we issue the strongest and most sincere apology that can be offered on behalf of the State to these women.</p></speech>

I also welcomed the assurance of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to the Justice for Magdalenes' campaign that the development of a narrative of State interaction with the Magdalene laundries would consider acts of omission on the part of the State, in particular the State's failure to inspect and regulate and thereby prevent abuse in the laundries.</p><p>  The committee produced an interim progress report within three months of its establishment in October 2011.  Along with a number of committee meetings, there were meetings with the religious congregations who ran the institutions, relevant academics, and representative groups of the women who resided in the laundries.  The committee reported that extensive searches of all State records had commenced, with results being reported regularly.  Relevant Departments and State offices not represented on the committee have also been contacted with a view to checks being conducted on their records.</p><p>  The report acknowledged the difficulty in identifying and tracing records going back over 90 years.  The committee acknowledged the co-operation of the religious orders which have given them their full assistance and coÂ­operation.  It also acknowledged the constructive engagement with the relevant advocacy and representatives groups.  The committee met Justice for Magdalenes, the Irish Women Survivors Support Network in the UK, and the Magdalene Survivors Group.</p><p>  The committee pointed out the complexity of its task, which required the tracing and examination of a large volume of records across a wide range of sources and covering a period of some 90 years.  Although Senator McAleese had hoped to conclude the work of the committee by mid-2012 he also stated this date might have to be adjusted, depending on the volume of records uncovered and the availability of resources.</p><p>  A significant level of information and documentation has already been identified by the committee and I understand the drafting of the final report has begun.  However, relevant records continue to be identified and the committee continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups.  Senator McAleese has advised that the committee intends to produce its final report as soon as possible, at the latest before the end of the year.  He has explained that information is still being identified which has the capacity to add to the overall outcome of the committee's work in a meaningful way and stated that the committee believes it would be improper to conclude without examining the additional material.  The State, the Government and individual Deputies like me must remember that the issue of the Magdalene laundries is fundamentally about the women who spent time in the institutions.  It is also about their children.  Many of the survivors are now are elderly.  Some women believe - with very good reason - that both church and State have pursued a policy of denial until admission became absolutely necessary.</p><p>  All the indications are that the report of the interdepartmental committee will put us in a position to have a meaningful debate on the issues raised by the different groups representing those who have been in Magdalene laundries.  I agree fully with the view of Government that to pre-empt the report of the committee by making decisions or assertions of fact is not the correct course of action to take.  We have been told we will have the report as soon as possible, certainly before the end of this year which at this stage is only a matter of months away.  The only reasonable course of action is to await that report.</p></speech>

It is almost incomprehensible to my generation and to younger generations that such institutions were allowed to exist.  Moreover, the laundry system was supported by the State through commercial contracts and, outrageously, through society's abandonment of vulnerable citizens for the most dubious of moral reasons.</p><p>  Reading through the testimony of the experiences of the survivors which has been compiled by the Justice for Magdalenes support group one cannot but be ashamed of this stark aspect of our collective past.  Trapped, abandoned, locked away and subjected to horrific abuse the women incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries were modern day slaves stripped of inherent rights and deprived of dignity.</p><p>  The 1911 census of the Mercy laundry in Galway shows women of all ages, all Roman Catholic and from nearly every county in the country.  Their home, such as it was, was Galway but not by choice.  In 2009 in Galway, a sculpture was dedicated to the women who endured the Mercy laundry.  The statue is of a woman in institutional drab clothes holding the sheet aloft to symbolise her enforced endless hours of work - a simple but provocative image.</p><p>  The effects on those houses of mercy are still felt today.  Testimony in the report from one Galway survivor states that she still suffers nightmares 50 years on.  Another eye witness states that a nun used a strap to beat a woman who was depressed and could not work until she was hysterical.  There are many examples of emotional and physical abuse, seclusion and humiliation of women.</p><p>  The excellent work carried out by Justice for Magdalenes not only catalogues these experiences and their aftermath but also sets out a historical account of the laundries and notes how a frenzied public morality combined with a dominant religious force and an indifferent Government transformed 19th century refuges into 20th century prisons and labour camps.  Furthermore, despite the assertions of a previous Government, the Justice for Magdalenes report demonstrates that the laundries were used by the courts as a place of so-called rehabilitation.  </p><p>  The detrimental effects blighted the lives of the women affected long after they had left these institutions.  Health problems, both physical and mental, relationship difficulties and marriage breakdowns, as well as strained relations with families and friends, arose out of this despicable system.  What is even more appalling is that some women were condemned to live out their entire lives in these institutions.</p><p>  As a society, we must face the reality that the abuse that occurred in the Magdalene laundries was in the public domain just as the clerical abuse catalogued by the Murphy and Ryan reports was known to be happening.  </p><p>  The religious orders cannot be let off the hook in terms of providing financial support for their part in this abuse.  This Government initiated the process when it established the interdepartmental committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese.  Regrettably, the conclusion of the committee's work has been delayed, which is perhaps inevitable as its work includes a large number of stakeholders as well as the identification and tracking of documents and records over several decades, but I am confident the committee will provide a comprehensive account of the State's involvement in the Magdalene laundries scandal and promote further debate from which restorative action will emerge.  The survivors and their families are entitled to closure on their long campaign for justice and I hope this is forthcoming very soon.</p></speech>

It was a period, from the foundation of the State, where our children conceived out of wedlock were not welcome in our society and their mothers were considered to be lesser citizens than everyone else, including the father of the child.  It was a time when it was deemed acceptable to deprive those women, many of whom were only girls, not only of their children but also of their freedom, forcing them into a life of unpaid labour and imprisonment.</p><p><br />  Thankfully, though deeply saddening, the treatment of those families is by now well documented.  The harsh reality for them has been articulated by many, including Justice for Magdalenes, and has been accepted by the Irish Human Rights Commission, the United Nations Committee against Torture, and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon that the State's failure to monitor conditions in the laundries amounted to grave and systemic violations of the human rights of all girls and women as protected by the Irish Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, international labour organisation conventions, and UN human rights conventions.</p><p><br />  Why was that the case?  Why did our State abdicate its responsibilities to its female citizens and children and hand them over to the religious orders?  Such was the neglect of its responsibilities that there was no inquiry, inspection or regulation.  For what crime were women incarcerated and punished?  Some became pregnant.  Many of them were victims of rape.<i></i>Others were incarcerated for petty crimes and for no reason other than they were orphans yet our State did nothing.</p><p><br />  It is ironic that what we now call Magdalene laundries were referred to as homes, asylums or refuges.  In the definitions of those words nothing could have been further from the truth.  Some of those in control of the laundries appear to have been Christians in name only.</p><p><br />  It is over ten years, February 2002, since the then Government acknowledged that abuse occurred in the Magdalene laundries.  I want to acknowledge and appreciate the testimony of the survivors and others who came forward with their evidence.  In the past our society put little value on people speaking out, especially where the Church and State were concerned, and I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for them not only to speak out but, in doing so, to relive a time in their lives which was unimaginably traumatic and disturbing, leaving them with lifelong emotional and physical damage.</p><p><br />  Almost two years ago, and a full eight years after the acknowledgement that abuse occurred in the Magdalene laundries, the Irish Human Rights Commission published a document entitled Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in relation to the Magdalen Laundries.  This document included the recommendation that any investigation &quot;should first examine the extent of the State's involvement in and responsibility for the girls and women entering the laundries; the condition of the laundries; the manner in which girls and women left the laundries and end of life issues for those who remained&quot;.</p><p><br />  I welcome that on taking office last year this Government established the interdepartmental committee to establish the facts of the State involvement with the Magdalene laundries as a matter of public interest.  In July last year, I was delighted when Senator Martin McAleese was formally appointed by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as the independent chair of the committee.  In establishing it, Senator McAleese requested that senior officials representing all the relevant Departments would sit on the committee, and within one week of his appointment the committee met.</p><p><br />  I welcome also the approach taken by Senator McAIeese and his committee to work positively and sensitively with all who have information of interest and assistance.  </p><p><br />  Considerable work has been completed so far by the committee in a spirit of openness and fairness offering complete confidentiality to those who volunteer to provide information and access to files and documents.  It is important that the committee be allowed to continue its work to establish the facts in examining how the four religious orders operated the laundries.</p><p><br />  I welcome the facilitation of the committee to encourage submissions from advocacy groups, individuals or representative groups to provide information, which may not have been already recorded, and also all the other information sought from State agencies including the Health Service Executive, the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the National Library of Ireland to mention a few.  Crucially, the committee has had meetings with representatives of Justice for Magdalenes, the Irish Women Survivor Support Network and Magdalene survivors.</p><p><br />  There is an enormous amount of information to be examined and, I suspect, more than we thought initially.  While I sincerely acknowledge the anxiety of all of those women, now elderly, and their families to see the conclusion of the work of the committee, I am optimistic that the committee can stay on its own schedule to conclude its work by the end of this year.</p><p><br />  I realise it is not in the terms of reference of this committee to make an apology to these deserving women and their families but the very least they deserve when all the facts are established is an apology, redress and restorative justice.</p></speech>

I am obliged to wonder about how we, as a society, have let these people down.</p><p> The Magdalene laundries are a great stain on the history of Ireland in the 20th century.  By voting in favour of the motion, Members have the opportunity to ensure that these laundries will not also become a stain on Ireland in the 21st century.  The purpose of the motion is to acknowledge the suffering the State participated in bringing about.  It also calls on the State to acknowledge the need for immediate and meaningful discussions on the need for both an apology and redress.  This State's treatment of women during the 20th century can only be described as appalling.  The Magdalene laundries are a horrific example of how the State turned a blind eye to the obvious mistreatment and abuse of women that was perpetrated by religious orders.  To this day, however, nothing has been done to address the plight of those to whom I refer.  Thanks to good investigative journalism, the vast majority of people living in this country now know of the terrible deeds that were done and the justice that was inflicted on these women but the State has failed to issue a quick and comprehensive acknowledgement of their needs.</p><p> Since assuming office, Labour and Fine Gael have not dealt comprehensively with the outcome of the previous Government's refusal to include the Magdalene women in the residential institutions redress scheme or to provide a separate redress mechanism or an apology.  This is not good enough.  Many of the women who were detained in the laundries are aging and time is of the essence in the context of bringing about a resolution.  Many of the women in question are also unwell and this is partly, if not wholly, due to the time they spent incarcerated in the laundries.  To add insult to injury, they cannot gain access to the pensions to which they are entitled after engaging in so many years of gruelling labour for the religious orders.  This is because those orders did not pay the women for their work and nor did they file normal annual employer returns to Revenue.  The latter was despite the fact that they ran the laundries as commercial enterprises.</p><p> In order for justice to be done, the Government must act now rather than allowing matters to continue to drift.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, in an assessment report compiled in 2010, found that women who were locked up in Magdalene laundries suffered serious abuses of their human rights.  The commission called on the Government to immediately establish a statutory inquiry into their treatment and to provide redress to the survivors, as appropriate.  It was supported in this regard by the UN Committee against Torture, which recommended that the State should institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations and, in appropriate cases, bring prosecutions, in addition to affording redress, compensation and rehabilitation to former residents of the Magdalene laundries.  There can be no doubt that what these women suffered in those laundries was nothing short of torture.</p><p> The Government cannot shy away from the responsibility is has to these women on behalf of Irish society.  The purpose of the motion is to challenge the Government to take the immediate measures necessary to support the women on the basis of the extensive information that is already in the public domain.  It is essential that the Government should take action.  Every backbencher should support the motion because justice delayed is justice denied.  We should not deny these women justice any longer.</p></speech>

I applaud them for maintaining their dignity and I compliment them on the way they managed their campaign to seek justice.  They have been an inspiration to people throughout Ireland in the context of how they have conducted themselves.</p><p>  The abuse that took place in the residential institutions is a dark stain on our country's history.  There are many lessons to be learned from what occurred, one of which is that no organisation, body or entity should have absolute power - as was the case with the Catholic Church and the State - over people's lives.  This must never happen again and we must ensure that there will always be oversight, transparency, supervision and accountability.  The women in question were locked up, enslaved and abused mentally, physically and, in some cases, sexually for no other crime than being considered nonconformist or somehow outside the norm.  This was at a time when there was a twisted view of what was women's role in society.</p><p>  It is ironic that we are obliged to engage in this debate, particularly as it comes within seven days of the Government announcing a date for the referendum to guarantee the rights of children.  While I welcome the referendum, I must point out that the Government continues to drag its feet on the granting of justice to those women who were enslaved in the Magdalene laundries.  The motion calls for the Government to commit to an open and meaningful debate on the issue of an apology - Deputy Regina Doherty referred to this fact - redress and restorative justice measures.  How can the Government not support these very simple and just demands?</p><p>  We have been dealing with this issue for many years.  It is ten years since the DÃ¡il formally acknowledged the appalling abuse that took place in the Magdalene laundries.  The women who were incarcerated in those laundries are predominantly aging and elderly.  We cannot wait any longer to obtain justice for them.  Such justice must be seen to be done and not when the Government or anyone else is ready.  Justice should be done in this Chamber tonight.  The women have waited too long and their suffering is only being compounded by the length of time it is taking to obtain justice for them.  It is not for the want of evidence that justice is being denied.  Some 22 months ago the Irish Human Rights Commission issued its report, Assessment of the Human Rights Issues Arising in regard to the Magdalene Laundries, and 15 months ago the United Nations stressed the need for the State to ensure that survivors will obtain redress.  However, the Government's silence regarding this matter has been deafening and its foot-dragging in respect of it is terrible.  In its report, the UN expressed grave concerns about the failure of the State to institute a prompt investigation into allegations relating to the ill-treatment that occurred in the Magdalene laundries.  Even the very congregations which ran the ten laundries have expressed a willingness to bring about clarity, understanding and justice in respect of the women involved.</p><p>  It is shocking that the State colluded in the imprisonment and enslavement of such large number of children and young women in the first instance.  Between 1926 and 1951, some 31,000 were kept in these shadowy, awful institutions.  As recently as 1964, children were being snatched from playgrounds and taken to other institutions in which they were treated in an equally cruel fashion.  Those children were never seen again.  All of this was done with active State support.  This is not a myth because I witnessed one incident of this happening, when the members of a family were snatched from a school playground and taken away.  They were never seen again.</p><p>  The question remains as to why the Government will not support the motion.  Prevarication is cruel, so why will this Administration not allow justice to prevail?  I appeal to those on the Government benches - in the spirit of the forthcoming referendum - to allow the bells of justice to ring out.  The facts are known so they should stop dragging their feet.  They should do the right thing and support both the motion and the women's quest for justice.</p></speech>

By that measure, Irish society has failed shockingly in respect of those who were resident in the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home.  There is little need for me to detail the abuse, neglect, incarceration, systemic oppression, institutionalisation, deprivation in the context of education and forced labour without pay experienced by tens of thousands of Irish women.  This has already been so eloquently done by my comrades.  I must state, however, that I was shocked to read the submission from the Justice for Magdalenes group.  I genuinely felt an enormous sense of disbelief that this type of abuse could have been visited upon vulnerable women.  To my generation, a significant part of the past is a foreign country.  However, it is unbelievable that the Magdalene laundry system remained in place until 1996.  I am equally dumbfounded by the fact that in 2012 Magdalene women have not received justice or even an apology.</p><p>  I am not naive.  In that context, I am aware that in the first half of the previous century Ireland did not have the welfare state safety nets necessary to protect vulnerable people.  I am also aware that in 2012, hundreds of young men and women are allowed to slip - often with tragic consequences - through the cracks in this austerity State's welfare system.</p><p>One would imagine that in a so-called progressive and enlightened society, people would act with haste and urgency to address the grievances, to apologise and to compensate.  Prolonging the injustice and allowing the clock to tick by for women in their 80s who were unjustly left without a pension due to the decisions of this Government, is a disgraceful and inadequate response.</p><p> Our motion does not even go that far.  All we ask is that the material well-being of these women, their ability to provide for themselves and their rights due from their work, are provided for.  It is not the case that the State was oblivious of their existence.  The State paid capitation fees and it paid for laundry services provided.  The State incarcerated citizens within its walls and it captured and returned escapees.  The funding of the Magdalene laundries and part-populating of them could only be done with full knowledge.  Partnership and participation with the system brings responsibility.  If the Government needs to know what is best to do then all it needs to do is remember what its members did when in opposition when they called for redress for these women.</p><p> In 2009, Labour Women made a determination that redress should be forthcoming.  The Irish Human Rights Commission found that serious issues of human rights arose with regard to the treatment of women and girls in the Magdalene laundries.  The UN Committee Against Torture recommended that the State issue prompt redress.  The campaign by Justice for the Magdalenes must be commended.  It has provided a powerful mirror to show us what sort of a society we were.  Unfortunately we cannot change the past but the Government and the Minister can seek to make amends tonight and change the present by accepting this motion.  The shocking facts are that the State used these women and the State failed to protect these women.  The State now has it in its gift to compensate these women.

I think of images of cold, thick walls, bars on windows, the smell of bleach and words such as cruelty, sadness, terror, poverty, unhappiness, regret, hunger, brutality, abuse, despair, beatings, imprisonment and silence.</p><p>  It is now three years since Justice for Magdalenes circulated an apology and redress scheme for survivors.  It is 22 months since the Irish Human Rights Commission stated that a statutory inquiry into alleged abuses and provision of redress should begin immediately.  It is 15 months since the UN Committee Against Torture detailed that the State should ensure that survivors should obtain redress within one year, but the Government continues to delay in providing all Magdalene victims with redress and, more important, with an apology.  The long delay is unacceptable but it is made worse when one considers that survivors of the laundries are elderly and suffering ill health as a result of their forced incarceration and some survivors have been refused pension entitlements by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Tonight as we discuss this motion we must remember also the survivors of another brutal Christian residential institution who were also failed by the State.  The women and children who survived shocking abuse in the Bethany Home are also elderly and they have fought bravely and courageously for an independent inquiry to examine what happened in this residential home, which was open from 1921 to 1972.  Earlier this year, when the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill was debated, I strongly argued that separate redress boards should be created for both the Magdalene laundries women and Bethany Home survivors.  However, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, refused probably because of the financial cost to the State and also because the Bethany Home was a privately owned mother and baby institution.  This does not mean that the State was not complicit; it failed these women and children.</p><p>  Between 1922 and 1949, more than 220 children died in the Bethany Home and 219 were buried in unmarked graves in Mount Jerome cemetery.  I pass their plot very regularly and cannot understand why this Government will not open an inquiry into how our State failed these defenceless children.  That place is a bleak spot with no flowers or markers, no large headstone nor any evidence of the babies and children who passed so quickly through this life.  There are no daisies nor anything else there; it is just a patch of ground.  I attended the cemetery plot recently in the company of some survivors and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  I made the point that we have compounded the hurt of these survivors by not including them in redress.</p><p>  I am reminded of what the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said when in opposition.  At that time she called on the Government to, &quot;do the decent thing and end this outrage.&quot;  These sentiments were supported by her now Cabinet colleagues.  Now these same Members are in a position to do in their own words, &quot;the decent thing&quot;, but they are sitting on their hands and refusing to honour their promises to the elderly survivors of this institution.</p><p>  The list of horrendous abuse in the Bethany Home is long and disturbing, yet we must not shy away from this black episode in the State's history.  In October 1939, following an inspection of the Bethany Home it was found that 14 infants had died since the last inspection of the premises and a total of 57 children were living in the home at the time.  In the same year, a report from an inspector in Monaghan on children who were boarded out from the Bethany Home found that the children were insufficiently clad, unwashed for weeks and that one sick and neglected child had not had a nappy changed for weeks.  Yet the State refused to act.  It suppressed the truth and simply ordered the home to stop admitting Catholics.  There is evidence that one child died there every three weeks between 1935 and 1940.  I ask if we can now do the decent thing but I have not heard any answers from the benches opposite.  We need to do the decent thing and step up to the plate for these women.  Certainly tonight we need to apologise on behalf of the State and we need to bring redress to these elderly people who suffered in these homes.</p></speech>

I am very grateful to have the opportunity to discuss this incredibly important issue and to speak on behalf of a group of very brave and strong people, those who survived what I have little doubt is the worst injustice ever visited on Irish people by other Irish people.  The story of the Magdalene laundries is a kind of horrific catalogue of grinding injustice and every new piece of information still shocks us, despite all that has been uncovered to date.  There is no ability to turn away.</p><p>  As legislators and so-called leaders, we will be nothing but failures, no matter what we achieve otherwise, if we do not do all we can to bring a just and honest close to this most shameful and sad chapter in Irish life.  This is a chapter in which only those who suffered at the hands of the laundries can really be called innocent.  The description of &quot;laundry&quot; or &quot;institution&quot;, should possibly be banned from use in the discussion these places.  We should call them what they were, prisons.  They were not prisons for criminals but for innocent women and children.</p><p>Moreover, their only crime was their gender, for which they were subjected to the hatred, fear and disrespect of both church and State.  It would be convenient for us to shift the blame entirely onto the church and the religious orders which ran the laundries.  The bottom line, however, is that the State which funded these institutions, directly and indirectly, must also bear the guilt.  Silence, apathy and collaboration are not the deeds of the innocent.  The reality is that the State allowed the Catholic Church free rein for many years.  While there were decent and genuine people among the clergy, it is an undeniable fact that the church in this country was riddled with individuals who lacked the most basic humanity and saw fit to treat women and children, in particular, as nothing more than property - useful in their way but ultimately deserving of hatred, violence and abuse.</p><p> Despite being designated as factories where clothes were washed for external use, the State failed utterly in its obligations to inspect the laundries.  The Factories Act 1955 stipulated that all operations covered by the Act were required to follow health and safety regulations and abide by employment law, as well as being subject to State inspection to ensure conditions were in order.  None of these requirements was upheld because the Magdalene prisons were above the law.  None of the ten laundries operating in the State was inspected, despite very high inspection rates for other factories.  It is difficult to accept that there was no concerted decision not to inspect the laundries knowing, as we do, what would have been found and the trouble it would have caused.  In response to a recent parliamentary question as to why the institutions had not been inspected, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, offered the quip that entitlement and requirement were not the same.  That is not good enough.</p><p> What will the Government do for the people who suffered at the hands of the State in this manner?  In 2010 a former Minister for Education and then Deputy, Michael Woods, tipped his hat to the victims in the debate on the establishment of the residential institutions redress scheme but offered nothing by way of a genuine response to their just campaign for redress.  That campaign for justice continues today.  A committee has been set up to establish the extent of State involvement, by now a well established fact.  I wish the committee well in its work, but it will not offer any resolution.  The bottom line is that the State failed utterly in its duty of care to these women and girls.  Even worse, it co-operated in their prosecution.  These citizens were kidnapped, abused, beaten and enslaved and told it was just punishment for their wrongdoing.</p><p> I take the opportunity to mention the victims and survivors of Bethany Home.  Between 1922 and 1949, more than 220 children died in the care of that institution, 219 of whom were buried in unmarked graves in Mount Jerome cemetery.  Although often forgotten, they are equally deserving of justice.  Bethany Home was essentially the Magdalene laundry for Protestant women.  Its survivors are entitled to justice and truth and must also receive a State apology and redress.</p><p> Throughout the world people remember and memorialise victims of injustice.  Monuments are built and plaques and statues erected in order to ensure they are never forgotten and to remind subsequent generations that the crimes visited on the people concerned must never be allowed to recur.  The time for prevarication is past.  The State must apologise to the victims of the Magdalene laundries and state unequivocally that what happened will never happen again.  The nation must act with a humanity and care towards the victims that will make the horrors of the laundries seem even worse by comparison.  We must give immediate redress and support to the survivors of these crimes.  TÃ¡imid ag lorg tacaÃ­ocht an TÃ­ le haghaidh an rÃºn seo ar GhnÃ³ ComhaltaÃ­ PrÃ­obhÃ¡ideacha.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.923" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="19:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600058#FFF00200"><p>One of the key issues to be addressed in regard to the Magdalene laundries is the role of the State, which encompasses not only its abdication of responsibility but also its role in covering up the mistreatment and injustice meted out to victims.  All aspects of the State's role are set out in a comprehensive report prepared for the interdepartmental Oireachtas committee established to investigate the matter by the Justice for Magdalenes group.  Among the disgraceful facts to emerge from that report is the revelation that Departments and public companies utilised the services of the laundries.  In fact, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in gave its custom to one of the institutions.  It is startling to see that the report documents transactions from as recently as 1980 and 1981.</p><p>  In its commercial dealing with the laundries the State was effectively utilising the services of indentured servants.  In fact, one might use even stronger words to describe the status of the women and girls who worked there.  There was also the wider issue of the State's failure to monitor what was going on in the laundries.  As in the case of the industrial schools administered by religious orders, this amounted to an effective privatisation of punishment.  Moreover, the women sent to the Magdalene laundries and placed under the charge of the nuns who ran them were not guilty of any crime under the law but merely of an offence against perceived social acceptability.</p><p>  The Irish Human Rights Commission has accepted that the failure on the part of the State to supervise the operation of the laundries amounted to a grave and systematic violation of the victims' rights as provided for under the Constitution.  The conditions under which they were made to work violated the European Convention on Human Rights, various United Nations conventions on human rights and the conventions laid down for conditions of employment by the International Labour Organisation.  The manner in which these young women were admitted into and detained in custody also violated the provision in Article 40.4.1o of the Constitution that no citizen &quot;shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law&quot;.  It is not inconceivable that had a case been taken on this basis, the reference to &quot;his&quot; might have been used as an excuse for what amounted to the illegal incarceration as workers without rights of the Magdalene women.</p><p>  In this context, it is remarkable that during the entire period of their operation, only one laundry - at Sean McDermott Street, which was designated under the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as a remand centre - was legally entitled to detain any person.  The treatment endured by the inmates violated international prohibitions on forced labour and degrading treatment, even though the State had ratified the 1930 convention which prohibited the use of &quot;forced or compulsory labour&quot;.  Even apart from these larger human rights issues, the laundries were in clear violation of domestic law.  For example, the provisions of the Factories Acts could and should have been applied and the institutions subjected to regular inspections.  If they had been carried out honestly, such inspections would have found the laundries to be in clear violation of the legislation.</p><p>  What makes the enforced slavery of the women concerned even worse is the fact that the laundries, far from being the charitable institutions they claimed to be, were, in reality, highly profitable businesses.  The Justice for Magdalenes report includes the claim by a former manager of the Magdalene laundry in Limerick that it had made a profit of some IRÂ£100,000 in 1976.  Not only was this a huge sum of money in those days, it would not be considered a poor return by a local laundry today.  This huge profit margin was made possible because the laundry workers were unpaid and without rights.  One can conclude that in the course of their operation the Magdalene laundries must have made several millions in profits.  In combination with the huge sums accrued by the religious orders in land deals, this makes it a moral imperative that survivors are duly compensated for their labour and loss of freedom and the degradation forced on many of them.  Anything less would be an insult to their suffering.</p><p>  Under the alleged care of these terrible institutions, young women were deprived of their civil rights and used as slaves for the profit and benefit of those who ran them.  Another speaker referred last night to an unfortunate young woman who escaped from one of the laundries only to be brought back and brutalised.  A relative of mine who tried to escape from an institution was likewise subjected to brutal treatment.  There is only one acceptable outcome to all of this, namely, a public apology from the State for what was done to the women concerned.</p><p>Compensation must be paid to those who had to endure the loss of their freedom and the injustice of being used as slaves by the State and religious orders.  Nothing else will suffice.</p></speech>

I have listened carefully and with great interest to what was said and the broad range of views expressed.  In particular, I thank Deputy McDonald for her contribution and for rightly affording all of us an opportunity to ensure this issue remains to the fore in our minds.  I have great sympathy for the women involved and it is fair to conclude from the contributions to the debate that the House is in broad agreement on this issue.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated last night, the story of the Magdalene women is one that has been told with a great deal of dignity and they deserve our respect.  No one who has met the women or listened to their stories can be anything but impressed by the eloquence of their testimonies.  I agree with much of what has been said in that regard.</p><p>  I assure the House again that the Government has listened carefully to the women and the various groups advocating on their behalf.  It is committed to addressing the issues and, unlike its predecessors, took action to put in place a process for doing so.  Almost immediately on taking office, we established such a process when we appointed an interdepartmental committee under the independent chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese.  I assure the House that we will see this process through and are fully committed to addressing these issues once the final report has been received.  The Government has been conscious at all times of the need to progress these matters as quickly as possible.</p><p>  As the Minister of State explained last night, the main point behind the amendment is that it is premature to have this debate without having the benefit of Senator McAleese's report and the factual information it will bring.  The report, which is being finalised, will help to establish the facts of State involvement, give us a better understanding of what took place and provide for the proper and meaningful response to which the Government is committed.</p><p>  Deputies will be aware that Senator McAleese was appointed to the chairmanship of the interdepartmental committee to ensure full confidence in its workings and preclude any legitimate issue arising with regard to the committee properly fulfilling its mandate.  They will also be aware and appreciate that Senator McAleese has been steadfast and absolute in his commitment to fulfilling that mandate.  Under his astute chairmanship, the committee is receiving the full and voluntary co-operation of everyone involved, including Government Departments, agencies, representative and advocacy groups and academics.  I also understand the Senator has met with many women who came forward to the committee both here and in England.  These women are being listened to and their stories will be told.</p><p>  Within three months of its establishment, the interdepartmental committee produced an interim report, as requested, and this report has been published.  The question of additional resources for the committee was also raised.  I understand, however, that it is satisfied that it has available to it the resources needed to complete its task and that the allocation of further resources is not required and would not speed up its work.  I also understand Senator McAleese has indicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality that he expects to be in a position to submit a substantial final report in a matter of months and certainly before the end of the year.</p><p>  While drafting of the final report has begun, I believe relevant records continue to be identified and the interdepartmental committee continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups, one of which was received as late as 15 August 2012.  Before we rush to make judgments, it makes sense to allow time for the committee to consider all the material that has been placed before it.</p><p>  As the Minister of State noted last night, all the indications are that the report of the interdepartmental committee will enable us to have a meaningful debate on the issues raised by the different groups representing those who have been in Magdalene laundries and provide a proper response.  Both the motion and amendment welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental committee, while the latter commits to an open and meaningful response to all the issues once the committee has reported.</p><p>  As I stated, the Government is conscious of the need to progress matters as quickly as possible.  The only difference between us and the Deputies opposite is that we will not pre-empt the report of the committee by making decisions or assertions of fact.  When we have the report, which will be before the end of the year, we will all be better informed and in a position to provide for a proper response based on the findings produced.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.926" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600059#GGG00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is a matter of urgency that the matter before us is addressed.  We are simply seeking to have an acknowledgement from all Members of the House that supports must be put in place urgently for the aging survivors of the Magdalene laundries.  Thereafter, we must have an open and meaningful debate on the issues of an apology, redress and restorative justice.</p><p>  We will never know the full story of the injustices, suffering and sheer torment experienced by the women and girls incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries.  This injustice was exacerbated and compounded by their exclusion from the residential institutions redress scheme. The Magdalene laundries and Bethany homes are another dark chapter in the litany of abuses perpetuated on the women of Ireland by the churches with State complicity, yet no apology has been forthcoming from the State for the terror inflicted on the women in question.  It is astonishing that not one representative of the Government Departments and statutory bodies which had a hand in ensuring the involuntary servitude of women has ever felt the need to apologise.  The State was complicit in the Magdalene laundries and questions remain about the role of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, which returned Magdalene runaways to the laundries by the hair on their heads.  Notwithstanding this, the Government sees fit to inform the House that an interdepartmental committee is examining the issue.</p><p>  I am not a spokesperson for the Magdalene women but someone who believes in justice.  I am also an elected representative who has a role in holding the Government to account.  The Government's approach is not good enough.  Having spent years and in some cases decades in incarceration, slaving, cleaning and toiling to keep religious orders as profitable industries, the Magdalene survivors are spending the rest of their lives shamed and stigmatised by a State that did not care.  Many of them are elderly and suffering ill health as a result of the treatment they experienced.  There are at least 30,000 Magdalene survivors.</p><p>  It is a tragedy of epic proportions that no member of the religious orders and no representative of the State has been held to account for the torture inflicted on what were described as &quot;fallen women&quot;.  Even today, questions need to be asked about the religious orders and their motivations.  Two of the religious congregations which ran the Magdalene laundries, the Good Shepherd Sisters and Sisters of Our Lady of Charity, receive funding from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health to work with women involved in prostitution, while other organisations which promote women's rights have had their funding slashed.  One could be forgiven for asking if it is still the official view of the State that there are fallen women out there.  Both of the religious congregations to which I referred have refused to meet the Justice for Magdalenes group, yet we are expected to believe it is appropriate that they are entrusted with caring for and advocating on behalf of vulnerable women.</p><p>  It is interesting that the State was run for decades on the basis of a Constitution framed around God and Christian values.  The way in which the Magdalene institutions were run, ignored by the apparatus of the State, could not be further from the teachings of Christ.  The Magdalene laundries were evil.  What we had in this State were anti-Christian institutions posturing as Christians.  Not only did they turn a blind eye to the disgusting enslavement of women and children, they also preached moral values to others, upheld conservative, right-wing establishment politics, and told people to keep their heads down and not question educated professionals.</p><p>The answer they have for our people is so profound but they could not have been further away from the teachings of Christ.  Each and every one of them should be ashamed of themselves.  The institutions which covered this up and utilised religion and Christ's teachings to enslave and hold our people down should be ashamed of themselves too.  I have had the honour of knowing genuine Christians who served overseas on the missions and defended oppressed people.  They too were let down and failed by their hierarchy.  This is the great shame of an institution which used the teachings of Christ to oppress their people and support institutions of government to do likewise.  Shame on anyone who was involved in that and calls themselves a Christian.</p><p> Those of us who actually have a faith in Christ need to have these conversations.  We are ashamed of those institutions which used Christ's name to uphold disgusting acts, to defend right-wing, conservative politics and to oppress our people for decades.  It is high time this issue was resolved with the obfuscation and stalling ended.  We know what happened in the Magdalene laundries was slavery and is a black stain on our people's conscience.  The Government must do the right thing and put in place the procedures for justice.  We can then wait for the report of Senator McAleese, in whom we all have great faith.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.928" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="19:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600060#HHH00200"><p>I can only imagine the fear, the isolation, the helplessness and, perhaps for many, the final submission felt by those women and girls incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries.  While I can only imagine the nightmare, I know there are many who live with the reality.  I am also conscious as we debate this motion that there are women and their families watching this debate for whom the Magdalene laundries is not a horror story but an actual horror that visited itself upon them directly, a horror with ongoing consequences.</p><p>  I find it unacceptable the Minister suggests the motion put down by Sinn FÃ©in is premature.  These sites of horror operated with the connivance and under the nose of the State from 1922 until 1996.  Let no one pretend we did not know.  We knew but we chose to look away.  The motion tabled by Sinn FÃ©in, with the support of our Independent colleagues and Fianna FÃ¡il, relies entirely on facts established and aired in the public arena.  There is no conjecture in it.  It is a fact that committal to and residence in the laundries was not voluntary.  It is a fact the State interacted actively with the laundries.  It is a fact these laundries, although private institutions, enjoyed considerable financial State support while women and girls were enslaved to work without pay.  It is a fact the State deliberately failed to inspect these laundries.  The trauma and the stigma endured by detainees which lives with them to this day is also a fact.  These are women who are aged and many of whom are ill.</p><p>  While few Members have sought to dispute these facts, I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, did so last evening.  In defending the Government's position, she cited the McAleese committee as the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, just did.  She said the committee would produce what she called the first comprehensive and objective insight into the laundries.  The Minister deliberately misrepresented the committee's remit.  It is tasked with establishing the extent of State involvement in these laundries, not the fact.  The Minister spoke as if there were no established facts, no survivors' testimonies, or no documented evidence of abuse or State interaction.  Shame on her.</p><p>  There was worse to come.  She also stated, &quot;As far as I am aware, allegations of abuse in Magdalene laundries have never been the subject of scrutiny by the courts, a commission of investigation or tribunal of inquiry, so the facts remain undetermined.&quot;  The hand-wringing Minister cast a doubt over the validity of survivors' testimonies because the women did not go to court.  She knows right well why there were no court cases.  She is fully aware of the reasons women who were brutalised, stigmatised and fearful did not go to the courts.  She is more than aware why cases could not now be taken because the Statute of Limitations prevents a survivor, even if she were so minded, from going to the courts now.  The Minister knew all of this but came into the Chamber last evening to deliver the Government's line without skipping a beat.  With all due respect to the Minister of State across the floor now, Deputy McGinley, he did the same this evening.  He claimed the women have been listened to.  Have they?  Has the story really been listened to?</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, advised us not to leap to conclusions.  I want to draw some conclusions about the behaviour of the State and the Government in this matter.  In May 2011 the Government, represented by the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, appeared before the UN committee against torture.  Its approach was disgraceful, defensive and stonewalling while its submission was misleading or, at the very least, incomplete.  The State claimed the laundries were private institutions, voluntarily occupied and outside the remit of State responsibility, bar one exception.  The Government was giving purchase to a lie that tried to convince us that nothing was known about the enslavement and brutality visited on women in these institutions.  That impression was a lie then and is a lie now.</p><p>  The Government tells us it does not want to pre-empt the McAleese committee.  The motion does not ask it to do that.  Instead, it recognises and welcomes the work of Senator McAleese but states clearly justice for the women does not need to be put on hold.  In fact, the motion insists justice for the women cannot and will not be put on hold.  The McAleese committee can proceed with its work but it does not stop the State from acknowledging the survivors, apologising to them and making arrangements for the basic support services they need now.</p><p>  Those on the Government backbenches will probably choose the path of least resistance and follow their Whips to vote against this motion.  That is their prerogative.  However, in making that choice, they will be co-opted into the defensive denial mode of the Government.</p><p>In making that choice they will allow this debate to draw to a conclusion with no Government acknowledgement of the damage done to the women or of the failures of the State.  They will leave these women yet again with no apology, no commitment to pension rights, no redress or the small comfort of knowing that this DÃ¡il will ensure the provision of supports needed by these women here and now.</p><p> Kicking the can down the road is an expression often used to describe political manoeuvres and delay.  Deploying this tactic on the Magdalene survivors is unworthy of this DÃ¡il and its Members.  I call on the Government to withdraw its amendment and support the original motion.  If my plea falls on deaf ears, know this: by sheer force of numbers the Government side has succeeded only in doing the wrong thing.</p><p> I commend the survivors of the Magdalene laundries.  Their stories are on the record.  We hear them and we believe them.  We cannot give them back their childhood, youth or their lives but we can say that they are due a full apology, redress, pension rights and a full affirmation of their innocence and their good name.  I put it to the survivors and to those on the Government benches that we will not rest until the justice that these women deserve is delivered.  The Government should do the right thing, set aside its stonewalling amendment and support this motion.  It is the least these women should expect from their elected parliamentarians.</p></speech>

However, I wonder whether the Government is as committed to that, particularly considering that in the past week we had the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  The proposal in that regard was to defer revetting because of the lack of resources.  This is a worrying trend and I hope it is something that will not continue when the children's referendum is passed.</p><p>  Funding needs to be made available in the immediate aftermath of the referendum for the Judiciary and for the Judicial Studies Institute to ensure the Judiciary is fully up to speed on what is intended and what we want to see happen with regard to the courts' interpretations of the amendment so as to ensure children's rights are vindicated as we want them to be.  It is also vital that the child and family support agency is fully and properly funded.  We must ensure this happens.  Placing children's rights in the Constitution is only half the battle.  We must ensure funding is there to ensure agencies can work to vindicate the rights of children.</p><p>  In conclusion, as the Minister pointed out, we have failed miserably in the past.  When we look at the legacy of child abuse, the children affected by the Magdalene laundries and at what went on in the Bethany homes, we see a record of failure.  This amendment shows that can and will change.  However, the amendment is only the halfway stage and we must ensure the legislation and resources are put in place to sure it is enacted properly.  The amendment is a good start and it shows we have some commitment to children.  We need to demonstrate we are fully committed to making it work for all the children in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.937" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600063#LLL00600"><p>I welcome the proposed thirty-first amendment of the Constitution which expressly recognises children in their own right within the Constitution and enshrines and gives firmer recognition to their protection.  It is important that the Oireachtas, in its deliberations, gets the strongest and most robust formula and wording possible in the Bill.  The wording must be based on clarity and facts in order to ensure the public fully understands it is first and foremost about children and that it affirms at all stages the protection and empowerment of these children, who are in many cases incapable of speaking for themselves.</p><p><br />  I will refer to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister last January asking about her plans to address the significant increase in calls to the Childline helpline on Christmas Day and asking her to make a statement on the matter.  Her response was as follows:<blockquote>  Childline is a confidential listening service for children and young people operated by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC.  The service is available by telephone, online and mobile texting and is operated by professionally trained ISPCC staff and volunteers.  The ISPCC reported that Childline received 1,387 calls and messages on Christmas day and that 85 ISPCC volunteers gave freely of their time to listen and support children who needed to talk to someone.</blockquote>The Minister went on to state:<blockquote>  I have no precise information regarding the breakdown of the nature of the calls received by Childline on Christmas day.   It is difficult therefore to make any assessment of the issues raised.  However, I have asked the Health Service Executive, as the body charged with statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection matters and which has an established relationship with the ISPCC, to liaise directly with the ISPCC on this issue with a view to identifying any particular areas of concern arising from the level of contact made with Childline on Christmas day.</blockquote>To be honest, this response is a sad reflection on society.  It exemplifies in micro fashion how on this particular day of festivity some 1,387 children felt they had to pick up the telephone and voice their concerns to the 85 volunteers who, fortunately, were accepting calls.  I compliment the ISPCC on its Childline service and on the work it carries out to protect and support the many vulnerable children it encounters in its role.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned the HSE.  There should be more contact and greater liaison and co-operation between Childline and the HSE to ensure maximum intervention protocols and the necessary monitoring systems are put in place.  I compliment support groups such as Barnardos and the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation which have restricted budgets and rely on voluntary efforts to carry out their vital roles in improving the quality of life of thousands of children.  </p><p> The need for constitutional reform has been accepted for many years.  It was discussed intermittently, if not at length, in the Oireachtas in the early 1980s.  A number of official reports that called for constitutional change to strengthen the rights of children were left on the shelf to gather dust.  The many court cases concerning child welfare in recent years have served to highlight the inadequacy of the current constitutional recognition afforded to the rights of children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has been calling for stringent protection for children's rights in the Constitution since the establishment of that office over eight years ago.  The ombudsman, Ms Emily Logan, first called for an amendment to the Constitution in January 2005 to enhance children's rights.  She has demonstrated since, especially through her officeâs complaints work, that there is an urgent need for childrenâs rights to be enhanced in the Constitution.  Many of the complaints with which she deals highlight a lack of awareness about the impact of civil and public administrative decision-making on the lives and rights of children and their families.  In her submissions to the Oireachtas she has called for a number of key elements to be included in the Constitution.  These include an express statement of the rights of the child, the best interests principle, a State duty to support families while responding in a proportionate manner and a provision to enable the sharing of soft information.  I am glad that many of her recommendations are contained in this proposal.  I hope the democratic exercise on 10 November will endorse the referendum proposal and enshrine key childrenâs rights principles in the Constitution in order to underpin a fundamental shift in our law, practice and policy on children.  </p><p> I congratulate the Minister on the compilation of the Bill.  I wish her well in her efforts to bring it through the Houses and have it endorsed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.939" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="20:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600064#MMM00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on and support the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of such a balanced wording.  I acknowledge the broad support for the amendment proposed in this legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the country generally.  That bodes well for the referendum on 10 November when I hope there will be a positive outcome, as I am sure there will be.</p><p>  I would like to set out the background to the forthcoming referendum.  During the years we were all rightly shocked by the findings of various reports such as the Roscommon, Kilkenny, Ryan and Cloyne reports.  The attitudes that allowed such abuses to continue had to be challenged and overcome.  The Bill which sets out the wording of the amendment to be put to the people in the proposed referendum is an important part of that process.  Obviously, it has to be read alongside other legislation, including the Children First Bill, the vetting Bill and the forthcoming legislation to establish the child and family support agency.</p><p>  The referendum has been a long time coming.  The first recommendations for constitutional reform in this area were made by the task force on child care in the 1980s.  Various committees have produced reports since.  At international level, in 1998 and 2006 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child added its voice to the calls for the constitutional position of children to be strengthened.  A number of High Court and Supreme Court cases have also raised concerns in this area.  There have been many indications that the current constitutional position presents a difficulty when particular cases have to be dealt with.  Thankfully, the Minister has introduced this legislation, which means a referendum will take place on 10 November.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the constitutional amendment will make children more visible and ensure decisions are made in the best interests of children.  It recognises that children have rights and that all children are equal.  It allows the rights of children to be balanced against other competing constitutional rights.  It introduces the best interests principle, to be used as a guide when decisions are being made to resolve disputes in areas such as adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  It also includes the principle of hearing the voice of the child in judicial and administrative proceedings and is active in the area of supporting families and protecting children.  It applies the same standards to all children and places an onus on the State to support families and adopt a proportionate response to parental failure.</p><p>  The language used in the wording of the amendment is balanced.  It refers, in the first instance, to &quot;all children&quot;.  It sets out what the State has to do &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  It makes it clear that these provisions will apply to parents who &quot;regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected&quot;.  It provides that the response of the State must be &quot;proportionate&quot; and in line with &quot;the best interests of the child&quot;.  I do not doubt that a great deal of thought and preparation went into such a balanced wording.</p><p>  The question of adoption is dealt with in the Bill.  At present, it is virtually impossible for a child to be adopted if his or her parents are married.  Approximately 6,000 children are in care, approximately one third of whom have been in long-term care for more than five years.  Many of them have little or no contact with their parents.  If the amendment is passed and the subsequent adoption legislation enacted, children in care will be eligible for adoption.  That will clear the way for the Oireachtas to introduce legislation that will allow any child to be voluntarily placed for adoption, which will be a welcome development also.</p><p>  I would like to refer to the question of resources which has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  It is fine to introduce a constitutional provision of this nature, but we need to ensure the actions of the State correspond to the provision in question.  We need to focus on poverty-proofing future budgets, for example.  Educational services in certain areas are not adequate and, unfortunately, have disimproved in recent years.  Larger class sizes and the lack of special needs assistants are having an impact on vulnerable children.  There are long waiting lists in the health area.  I am contacted on a daily basis by parents who are waiting for ear, nose and throat services for their children.  Urgent cases can now wait for 18 months, while less urgent cases can wait for as long as four years.</p><p>These are areas that need to be addressed and improved by the State.  Approximately 200,000 children in this State live in either consistent or relative poverty, which is an area that also needs to be addressed by the State.  Resources need to be made available to ensure what we have in the Constitution actually corresponds to what we are doing in practice on the ground, particularly for vulnerable children.</p></speech>

The Government has placed children's interests at the top of its priority list since its inception and, for the first time, a senior Cabinet Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was appointed with responsibility for children's affairs.  This is the fourth referendum the Government will have held in 18 months, which proves it is a reforming Government and wants to see real change in Irish society.  I commend the Minister and the Cabinet for bringing this Bill and the amendment to the Constitution to the Oireachtas and to the people in the coming weeks.</p><p>  It is not only this Bill as there is other legislation which will impact on children who might be vulnerable.  There is the vetting legislation which was referred to in the House earlier in the week and which will introduce statutory legislative requirements for those who work with or come in contact with children on a regular basis.  There is also the proposed adoption legislation and, of course, the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, which will have the responsibility for child welfare and protection services, for which the HSE will no longer be responsible.</p><p>  I recognise the Minister's commitment to this area and her track record.  It is no surprise to me because of her dedication, work and commitment that she has managed to bring what has been a complex and difficult issue to the people to decide.  I would also like to commend the joint committee that sat over many meetings and deliberated on the wording of any proposed referendum.  The former parliamentarians of all parties who were involved should be recognised as we pass this legislation through the House.  I believe the cross-party support for the Bill reflects the maturity of this democracy and this Parliament.  However, we need to caution against complacency and ensure the people are fully informed of this debate and the implications it will have for the system of protection for children who might be at risk.  This has been going on for the past 20 years and, at last, we are seeing progress.</p><p>  I am a parent of three small children and believe it is important to acknowledge the many thousands of parents who look after their children, day in, day out and at night as well, because it is not easy to rear children in the current climate.  It has never been easy.  However, parents do what they do best, and they put their best foot forward to rear their children and give them the best chance in society.  We need to publicly acknowledge this but while we do, we also acknowledge there are difficulties in some families and there are children at risk.  This is where the weaknesses have been, although it has taken until now to acknowledge this.  We are finally giving the people of Ireland the opportunity to put that right.  This is an important point in regard to the referendum and the legislation.  It will not only be for children who are citizens of this country but for all children who reside in the country.  They will all be protected under this new legislation and the changes to the Constitution.</p><p>  I am the chairperson of a board of management of a mid-size, 250-pupil primary school in County Waterford.  I am acutely aware of the obligations on boards of management and people in positions of trust given the protection policies and school policies that have to be in place to ensure full protection.  It is only right that in the most important policy statement of all, namely, the Constitution, children's rights are put first and foremost and that the best interests of children are protected.</p><p>  We should also recognise the NGOs and advocacy groups who have always been a voice for children despite the fact the Constitution and the courts may not have heard the important voice of a small child in difficult cases.  I am happy to support a Bill that will give the opportunity for the Irish people to let that child be heard in all proceedings relating to those cases.  I commend the Bill and commend the Minister for her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.944" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="20:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600065#NNN00500"><p>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the Chamber and compliment her for the fact she has been present for almost all, if not all, of the debate, which shows her and her Department's seriousness on this issue.  I also acknowledge as a very welcome move the Government's decision to hold the referendum on a Saturday, which is particularly important for first-time voters and those who are away from home.  If the Minister takes anything from my contribution, I would urge the Government to put Saturday polling on a legislative footing.  Going forward, this is something the State should do, at a minimum, to allow people to exercise their franchise.</p><p>  Before I came into the DÃ¡il, I worked as a teacher.  Having listened to more experienced and more seasoned campaigners than myself in the teaching profession, I was struck by the fact experienced teachers could identify with a sense of accuracy when a child presented himself or herself in junior infants how that child was going to progress.  More often than not, they got it right down through the years.</p><p>  This referendum, if it protects one child, will be worth it, given the litany of scandals that have surrounded this whole area since the State was founded.  It definitely has been the pall of shame over Ireland since independence.  Successive Administrations down through the years, for one reason or another, whether for fear of outside institutions and pressure groups or just out of sheer ignorance, decided that the mantra that the child should be seen and not heard was the most important thing.  I want to acknowledge the fact children are being given a constitutional voice in this, the 75th anniversary year of the Constitution, which, by and large, has been a very robust and good document.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, children will be recognised legally as equal citizens with the rest of us.  The Minister and the Government should be complimented for this.</p><p>  Reference was made to the dozens of reports and the 20 year lapse since Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness first enunciated the need for a referendum.  We are forgetting the fact there were children behind all of those reports.  One of the images I constantly have in my mind from the Roscommon report is how the children presented themselves with lice climbing down their faces.  There was a litany of failure from the State, its institutions and people working in this area.  It is one thing to amend the Constitution but another to ensure the structures are put in place to allow the primary teacher, the social worker, the swimming coach or the librarian who might have a concern for a child to, in a very safe and responsible fashion, enunciate that concern.</p><p>  As I and previous speakers have said, it is one thing to amend the Constitution but a totally different thing to roll that all the ensuing provisions out on a day-to-day basis.  This is why the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will make a difference.  For the first time, children are not just shoved under the Department of Health or seen as an add-on to the Department of Education and Skills but are seen as equal citizens in this democracy, with a Minister whose sole responsibility is to them, and them alone.  One of the issues that has become relevant is that the collapse of the family and the cycle of abuse and neglect is not a modern phenomenon but is something that reports in the media have forced on us as legislators, both in this and previous generations.  In fairness, legislators in some cases have been dragged kicking and screaming, as has society, into modernising the institutions that are there to protect children and to ensure children are given the protection of the State they deserve.</p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy referred to the issue of adoption.  As a new Deputy, I was totally unaware of the hurdles that face families.  I have since spoken to the Minister several times in regard to inter-country adoption.</p><p>I was totally ignorant of the fact that over 2,000 children are in long-term foster care, for whatever reason, but their foster parents are unlikely to be able to adopt them under the current regime.  This referendum may give them the chance of a normal family life.</p><p> All of us in this Chamber were probably lucky enough, like myself, to have good parents who brought us up in the best way that they knew, putting their children first always.  This referendum and the legislation we are debating may only affect a small number of children, but if it protects one and if it prevents another Roscommon or prevents another child from having lice running down his face, then it is a good day's work.  I compliment the Minister for bringing this Bill forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.946" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/972" speakername="Se&aacute;n Conlan" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600066#OOO00200"><p>I am pleased to be a member of a Government which is actively pursuing a suite of legislation aimed at addressing an issue which has been at the forefront of moral, social, religious and political discourse in this country since the child abuse issue broke the surface of the idyllic society of our parents and forced us as a people to confront the demons embedded within and to accept that all is not well when a modern democracy fails to afford constitutional protection, so cherished by our citizens, to almost 20% of our population.  It reflects badly on us when those denied protection are the most innocent and vulnerable among us and are wholly incapable of protecting themselves.  I am speaking of our most treasured asset, our future, those who will carry the mantle of this nation in the future .</p><p>  The suite of legislation undertaken by this Government, the enactment of which is being expedited by our specifically designated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, is aimed at addressing the protection of children in a real and meaningful way.  The jewel in the crown of the process is the introduction of the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012, which will amend the Constitution and insert a new article, Article 42A, which will have the effect of enshrining the protection of children and expressly recognising them in their own right within the Constitution.</p><p>  In passing this Bill we are galvanizing the protection of children and ensuring the right of every child to be afforded constitutional protection in their own right.  In doing so, we are displaying a maturity and establishing ourselves as a nation where every citizen is truly cherished equally and entitled to enjoy all the rights conferred on us by our Constitution.  We are truly implementing change.  We are no longer paying lip service to the abhorrent revelations that came dripping slowly from a hidden Ireland, where abusers and predators were at best ignored and at worst, protected.  I am not referring to any particular sector of society in saying this, as child abuse spans every socioeconomic, cultural, religious and political boundary and is to be found anywhere the light fails to shine.</p><p>  As a Government we are succeeding where others have failed.  We are ceasing the practice of displaying shock and horror, practised by previous Administrations, at the horror stories and cases bursting on to the media, only to be forgotten about when the next big issue arose.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, elevated the children's portfolio to a Front Bench position as far back as 2007 and was the first to give recognition to the important position children should be afforded in Government.  He followed through on this important process by creating a new Cabinet position of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, which has been eminently filled by my party colleague, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, who deserves great credit for tackling this gaping absence in our legislation and Constitution, whereby children and the most vulnerable among us were denied the protection available to other citizens.</p><p>  The need for this protection has been highlighted by successive reports including the Kilkenny incest case and subsequent investigations, the Constitutional Review Group report of 1996, the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution report of 2006, the Roscommon incest and rape case and the subsequent report of 2010, the report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children in 2010, as well as various clerical abuse tribunals.  Almost 20 years have passed, when we had money for everything, without this gaping hole in our society being addressed.  It was not as if there were few incidences of abuse.  Last year alone, of the 30,000 child protection and welfare concerns reported, 1,500 were confirmed cases of sexual, physical or emotional abuse and that does not include the vastly more numerous welfare issues.</p><p>  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and this Government do this nation a great service and deserve the support of this House in forging ahead with these various instruments of legislation, which will finally afford protection to our children who hold the hopes and aspirations of a struggling but proud nation in the palms of their hands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-09-26a.947" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012092600066#OOO00300"><p>It is entirely appropriate that as the Minister sits here and listens to the debate, she has a copy of the Constitution in front of her.  Perhaps she carries it with her all of the time but it is particularly appropriate that she has it here tonight because, of course, it is the Constitution itself that we are seeking to change.  As we do this, it is appropriate to reflect on where the Constitution came from and the good that it has done the State to date.</p><p>  As we acknowledge the 75th anniversary of this document, which Deputy O'Donovan did earlier, it is very easy to forget what a brave and progressive document it was in the context of where Ireland stood then.  It stood as a small country on the edge of a very fraught and uncertain Europe.  There were many recognitions and systems put into that document that have served our country very well and have stood the test of time.  However, as many other speakers have commented, the one group that was not referenced at all was children.  One factor that distinguishes them is that, unlike other groups that were referenced in that document, children do not have the ability to organise themselves or to come together collectively and articulate what they are looking for in the way that many other groups, that were rightfully enumerated in the document, do.  Children do not choose their parents nor the families into which they arrive.  The environment is something that is a given for them and they have to choose how to respond to it.  With that in mind, it is an omission in the document that has not served our country well and that has had terrible consequences for children over different generations.</p><p>  When we talk about children within the amendment we are putting forward to the country, we are not just talking about children at risk.  We are actually talking about all children.  We are talking about making sure that they, as a group and as individuals, are explicitly recognised within our Constitution and that their rights are clearly called out.  This will have many consequences in the future which, in truth, few of us can foretell.  We do not know how they will develop and crystallise.  That can only be a good thing for the group that has not been recognised to date.</p><p>  The number of children we are talking about, notwithstanding what I have just said, who might be affected by this constitutional amendment in a material way is, thankfully, tiny.  However, these are children to whom we have not given the right protection or support over the years.</p><p>  One aspect of the amendment that I particularly welcome is that the threshold for intervention it sets is high enough to ensure that it will only be called in or triggered in exceptional cases, where children are not just being let down by their families but are being afforded no form of protection at all and are in desperate need of support.  At the same time, the threshold is not so low as to augment the fears of those who have concerns regarding an expansionist State or are worried about the State trying to take the place of parents.  If such people actually read the wording of the amendment, I hope they will see that such fears are groundless and will not be materialised.</p><p>  The best way I can finish my short contribution is to quote from the amendment itself.  Members have all studied the wording and I hope the people do as they contemplate how they will vote.  One particular phrase is worth emphasising, &quot;...the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents...&quot;.  We are talking here about the common good.  A philosopher once said that the way to judge the maturity and success of a democracy is by how it treats its most vulnerable.  We are dealing here with an articulation of the common good that recognises the young people who need our help the most, who offer the clearest vision possible of what the common good looks like.  The phrase &quot;endeavour to supply the place of parents&quot; is important.  The State is not looking to take the place of parents.  It has no such ambition and is not seeking to do so.  It is simply saying that in the case of those children who need our help the most, we will realise the common good by giving them all the help that we can.  Changing these words in the Constitution will allow us to do that better in the future.</p></speech>
