The combined wholesale and retail sector in Ireland employs 273,000 people which is one in every seven working in Ireland at the end of 2012.  The sector also supports employment in other related services such as transport and logistics.  A number of bodies represent different parts of the retail sector, with RGData representing independent family-owned grocery shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets.  I launched the first of AIB's series of outlook reports for the SME sector on Friday, 19 April.  It is a very detailed report on the retail sector.  As that report was focused on the retail sector and undertaken in conjunction with RGData I met with the director general of RGData at that event and on numerous other occasions.  In addition RGData was part of the local jobs alliance delegation which met with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in September 2012.</p><p>In addition, a representative of RGDATA, the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, sits on the high level group on business regulation, which I chair, so we engage regularly on issues relevant to the retail and small business sector through that forum, including the meeting on 30 January last.  RGDATA has been active in making input in many areas affecting the business climate and many of the reforms introduced by the Government have responded to these concerns.</p><p>In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs contains several measures aimed at supporting the sector.  We are currently introducing new initiatives including the rationalisation of 25 retail licences and provision of a single retail licensing system which will cut down on regulation; promoting a proposed competitive voucher scheme to assist retailers to go online and strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>There will also be the integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses.  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing an interdepartmental group to undertake a short examination of possible further measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  The group will comprise key Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  RGDATA will be one of the representative bodies which is consulted as part of that examination of the retail sector.</p></reply>

Concerns have been expressed by RGDATA and other small business organisations about the practices adopted by AIB and Bank of Ireland regarding banking charges.  For example, there has been a 165% increase in lodgment fees by AIB, the State-owned bank to small business.  I know of a practice by Bank of Ireland, one I suspect also used by AIB, of designating certain days for lodging coin and others for lodging cash.  As an experienced businessman, the Minister knows a small business will not know what day it will have to lodge notes or what day, coins.  Has the Department expressed concerns to the banks about these kinds of decisions?  The banks are making day-to-day business banking more expensive and more awkward.  Has the Minister had any interaction with the banks on this?  Is the RGDATA report quoted by the Minister earlier sponsored by AIB?</p></speech>

I plan to raise this issue with the banks.  It, as well as cheque clearances, is a significant charge for a small business&rsquo;s bottom line.  I am disappointed they raised the charges for handling cash.  Representatives from AIB and Bank of Ireland will attend the advisory group on small business, which RGDATA sits on too, to discuss access to credit.  This matter can be raised with them as a follow-on question.</p><p>  The report on retail trends launched last week by RGDATA pointed out how there has been a seismic shift to discounters.  It found that three out of four retailers are seeing consumers buying more items on special offer.  Up to 57% of retailers experienced a decrease in turnover between 2011 and 2012, while 16% reported an increase.  A key finding from the survey was that half of those who took part in it plan to improve or expand their business in the next three years while one out of five expects their business to be taken over by a family member.</p><p>  I intend to raise the issue of increased bank charges and stacked up hidden costs for small businesses with the banks at the next advisory group meeting.</p></speech>

What is happening is ridiculous.  The banks are doing the bank robbery and robbing business.  As the Government is the prime shareholder in AIB, will the Minister point out forcefully that these practices are not helping the growth of the economy and are actually destroying businesses trying to create jobs?</p></speech>

The credit guarantee scheme and the microenterprise loan fund are among those initiatives.</p><p>  The credit guarantee scheme has been live since 24 October and is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable businesses.  It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential.</p><p>  A total of &euro;299,981, including VAT, has been paid to the operator of the scheme.  The cost of the scheme will be partially offset by receipts from the 2% premium paid by borrowers.  To date, loans of over &euro;3 million have been issued under the scheme, as a result of which over 200 jobs are expected to be created or maintained.</p><p>  The second initiative is the microenterprise loan fund which was established by Government and began operating at the beginning of October to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses.</p><p>  The State provided a grant of &euro;10 million in 2012 to Microfinance Ireland, the company established to administer this scheme.  I can report that the cost for 2012 was &euro;461,000, which includes once-off set up costs of &euro;278,000.  To date, applications of over &euro;2.5 million have been made under the scheme and &euro;700,000 has been approved, as a result of which over 110,000 jobs are expected to be created or maintained.</p><p>  In relation to the cost of both schemes, Exchequer gains in terms of employment sustained and created, savings on welfare payments and increased direct and indirect taxes have been calculated at over &euro;20,000 per job.  On this basis I am satisfied that both schemes are more than balanced by the potential benefits.</p><p>  In addition to these initiatives, the seed and venture capital scheme, the Innovation Fund Ireland and the development capital scheme are helping Irish companies, including SMEs, access funding in the current difficult environment.</p></reply>

I also tabled questions on legacy debt for small businesses but his Department decided not to answer those and they were forwarded to the Department of Finance.  I ask the Minister to request that these job-centric questions be answered properly by the Department in future.</p></speech>

We tabled questions about legacy debt for the Department of Finance also.  They are specifically tailored for this Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300005#C00500"><p>One of the major breaks on this economy is debt overhang and the ability to access credit.  It is one of the reasons we in Sinn F&eacute;in have insisted time and again that stimulus by the Government is necessary.  In other words, when private investment is paralysed, the State must invest.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Government will come around to that view but the issue is how long it will take it to do that and the damage that will be done in the interim.</p><p>  It is important to state that the Government has given a number of responses with regard to credit but we should examine the size of the problem.  The Minister has put &euro;64 billion of our money into the banks.  Fiona Muldoon from the Central Bank of Ireland has stated that 50% of &euro;58 billion of impaired debt is due to the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  If construction is taken out of that, we are talking about at least &euro;8 billion, or 35%, of SME debt which is impaired.  It is impossible for those healthy businesses to survive.  Spicers in Navan, for example, had a functioning business, a product that would sell and a customer base but, unfortunately, it had diversified into property and the entire business was sunk.</p><p>  We have asked the Government time and again to deal with this issue through the banks, the organisations that got the money, but it has refused to do that.  It has brought forward a number of smaller projects and funds which make up &euro;200,000 here and &euro;2 million there but do not come near the billions of euro hampering this economy.  What has the Minister done to get the Economic Management Group to go to the banks to get this issue resolved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300005#C00600"><p>I understand the Deputy's frustration but there are issues that are not dealt with by my Department.  The presentation of a stimulus package, whether it be PPPs, infrastructure funds or whatever, is not the responsibility of my Department.</p><p>The Deputy could table a question and receive a response from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The situation is similar with regard to impaired loans.  I know the Financial Regulator is talking about setting targets for the small business sector in the same way as targets have been set for mortgage holders in terms of dealing with problem loans.  However, responsibility for that lies with the Minister for Finance.  I am not being obstructive; that is just the situation.</p><p> I agree we must be innovative in the way we create a stimulus.  If we tot up all the access to funding schemes for SMEs the Government has put in place, that will amount to &euro;2.5 billion.  Much of that is now funded from the NPRF.  In addition, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has a &euro;2.25 billion stimulus scheme in place, through PPPs and other capital programmes and NAMA has indicated that it is investing &euro;2 billion in its property folio.  These are ways - off the balance sheet - for providing a stimulus and the Government is committed to creating opportunities for job creation.</p><p> The questions tabled, which I answered, related to the cost of schemes our Department has sponsored and I dealt with that.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300006#D00600"><p>I am pleased to say that a preliminary first reading agreement was achieved on 9 April last by the Irish Presidency of the Council on the draft EU accounting directive, which we had set as a priority during the Irish Presidency and which is an important item of EU legislation.  The EU Committee of Permanent Representatives approved this preliminary agreement at its meeting on 17 April, thus preparing the way for adoption of the accounting directive on the basis of the present text.</p><p>  The directive is important in that it updates the EU's accounting legislation and provides for simplification and administrative burden reductions, in particular for small and medium enterprises.  It is one of the final outstanding parts of the Single European Market.  Also, under specific provisions of this directive, at chapter 9, information on the revenue streams which governments in resource-rich countries around the world receive from European companies active in the extractive industries and in the logging of primary forests, will require to be provided by the industries in question.  As a consequence, the populations of these countries will have this information available to them.  This acts as an accountability mechanism <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the governments in question.</p><p>  In the accounting directive, natural resource companies - large companies and public entities - will be required to report all payments in excess of &euro;100,000 to governments and local authorities in the countries where they operate.  This information will facilitate accountability of both companies and governments to citizens of mineral rich countries regarding the contracts that they undertake.  It will increase transparency of the moneys that oil, gas, mining and forestry companies pay to governments and local authorities.  Under the reforms, companies will need to publish total payments for each country in which they operate and for each project, taxes on profits or production, royalties, dividends, bonuses, related fees and payments for infrastructure improvements.  There is no exemption for disclosing these details in countries where this may breach local laws.</p><p>  The provisions of the accounting directive will take effect in the European Union two years, at the latest, after its adoption.</p></reply>

I acknowledge the work the Government and officials have done to support the accounting directive.  This is something NGOs and civil society have been seeking for some time.  The EU Commissioner, Michel Barnier, has said that local communities in resource-rich countries will finally be better informed about what their governments are being paid by multinationals etc. for exploiting oil and gas fields, mineral deposits and forests.  This directive must mean more than that they will be better informed, because these communities are losing out big time.  They should see the benefits of the resources in their countries.</p><p>  Some $1 trillion disappears without trace from developing country, abetted in the main by multinational companies evading taxes.  The disappearance of these moneys is also supported by corruption on the part of officials.  This issue has been called the ugliest chapter in global economic affairs since slavery.</p><p>Will Ireland build on what has been achieved in the directive, particularly in chapter 9, to create and support greater transparency in country-by-country reporting?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her commendation of the officials in my Department, who have done a great deal of work.  As she probably knows, painstaking work is required to get these things over the line.  I will convey her remarks to my officials.  It is clear that abuses have developed in this area.  The NGOs have been extremely exercised about it, and rightly so.  The directive creates a charter for transparency.  I understand that similar provisions are included in the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US.  We are beginning to see a commitment on a broad global basis to having more transparency in this area.  I hope that reduces the sorts of abuse mentioned by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Did the Government support the inclusion in the review clause of additional sectors, such as telecommunications and construction, that could be included in the directive?  While I accept what is being done with regard to oil, gas and mineral reserves, I think similar efforts could be made in other areas.  It is interesting that at a recent climate change conference, President Higgins outlined some figures to demonstrate the extent to which multinational companies dominate particular sectors, such as the food sector, in the developing world.  There is great scope for action to be taken in this huge area.  There is great scope for Ireland, as a well-respected country, to do more to build on what has been done with regard to tax justice.</p></speech>

I understand there has been broad-based support from the Council, the Parliament and the NGOs for what has been achieved here.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300007#E00700"><p>A Forf&aacute;s report that was published recently, Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012, indicates that business costs have decreased significantly in recent years, with overall prices in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002.  This is an important report in the context of our need to continue to build an export-led recovery.  It examines the relative importance of different areas of cost for different sectors.  The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by dramatic reductions in property-related costs, in terms of purchase and rent levels, and falling prices across a range of professional and business services.  We have also seen relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland, which fell by 0.9% per annum between 2008 and 2011.  By contrast, labour costs in the euro area increased by an average of 4.6% per annum in the same period.  While these improvements are welcome and indicate that we are moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy.  The report advises that over half of recent cost competitiveness gains are attributable to favourable exchange rate movements.  The report also indicates that upward price pressure is beginning to emerge in some areas, while rigidities persist within the economy.</p><p>  The report highlights the fact that Ireland is still out of line with our key competitors on a range of business inputs.  Despite the reductions achieved to date, labour costs remain relatively high and are over 6% above the euro area average.  Energy costs remain a cause for concern, particularly for the SME sector, with Ireland as the fourth most expensive location in the euro area for electricity.  Waste costs in Ireland are higher than those elsewhere in Europe.  Despite the recession, legal service prices are 11% above 2006 levels.  The report shows that Irish consumer prices are 12% above the euro area average.  This is a significant indirect cost for business because it puts upward pressure on wage expectations.  Another issue highlighted in the report is the impact on our competitiveness of labour taxation.  The marginal rates of income tax are 52% and 55% for employees and the self-employed, respectively.  This is higher than in many of our competitor countries.  In addition, these rates commence at a relatively low level of income.  Tax rates of over 50% on average incomes damage inward investment and entrepreneurship and can act as a disincentive to work.  It was in recognition of this issue that I said the Government must continue to keep its promise by avoiding further increases in the burden of taxes on work if we are to sustain and accelerate the transition in our economy and the jobs recovery that has begun.  We must begin to reduce the income tax burden as soon as possible, starting with hard-pressed families on average incomes.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>I draw a comparison with our nearest neighbours in the UK, where one pays 20% tax up to approximately &euro;37,000 and then a marginal rate of tax of 40% on income up to &euro;175,000.  The contrast highlights the mistake, in my opinion, of previous Administrations, under which 80% of fiscal correction was made through increases to income tax.  The Forf&aacute;s report makes a number of recommendations aimed at further improving our cost competitiveness position.  Part of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the development of proposals each year that can improve our competitiveness.  This report will be a valuable input into developing further proposals.  Forf&aacute;s is undertaking detailed work in areas such as licensing and regulation, ease of doing business and wider measures that would enhance competitiveness.  This is intended to develop proposals that can be enacted in the years ahead.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government's broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.</p></reply>

The cost of credit for new loans to Irish enterprise exceeds costs in the euro area for a range of loan types from the banks, but also from a State scheme, the microfinance scheme, which at over 8% is far higher than many euro projects.  A warning contained within the report, as the Minister will have read, is that Irish consumer prices are 12% above euro area prices.  What we are paying for food in particular is far in excess of the average in the euro area, which, in itself, is an indirect cost for business.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned 2002.  Between 2002 and 2006, in particular, the consumer price index and costs rocketed.  It was very difficult to do anything after costs had gone up but the Minister now has the chance to intervene before those costs begin rising again.  It will be difficult to lower the consumer price index unless we tackle the cost of our utilities - for example, our excessive water costs.  In light of the Forf&aacute;s report, has the Minister brought specific concerns or plans to the Government with regard to our utility costs and the cost of banking in Ireland?  With regard to the agencies within his Department, has he any proposals for controlling the consumer price index, particularly the cost of food, at a time when labour costs have come down and people are being paid less while the cost of living is actually going up?</p></speech>

The report seeks the rapid implementation of those.  In the case of electricity, while the Deputy might be better tabling a question to the Minister with responsibility for energy, I understand the ESB has been implementing a process of cost reduction.  Some of the disadvantage is in the fuel mix we have.  No doubt the ambition to diversify sources of fuel is an important aspect of long-term delivery of cost-effective electricity.</p><p>  In the area of consumer prices, I have beefed up the Competition Authority, which will be merged with the Consumer Agency later in the year, and I have put additional staff there to look at areas in which there is potential or real abuse of competition.  I am determined to see effective implementation of our competition legislation.  The issue with regard to banking is one we can discuss and I acknowledge the point that has been made.</p></speech>

It is an unfortunate reality that businesses can find themselves in difficulty for a wide range of reasons.  The company in question was an ocean energy research project in the pre-commercialisation stage of development.  The Deputy will be aware that policy responsibility for energy research falls within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>  The ocean energy development unit established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in 2009 is charged with co-ordinating the relevant activities of State agencies and initiating other measures to promote and develop this sector.</p><p>Companies in the early stage development of ocean wave energy projects are assisted by the SEAI.  Where appropriate, Enterprise Ireland works with its colleagues in the SEAI to assist companies in the commercialisation of a validated technology.  In such cases, Enterprise Ireland's role is to assist the promoters to develop their business proposition, including their funding strategy, and make introductions to Irish and international seed and venture capital funders.</p><p> I understand from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that the SEAI was liaising directly with the company prior to its closure.  I also understand Enterprise Ireland made itself available to meet the company to discuss ways in which it could be of assistance.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to prevent the closure of the company.</p><p> Notwithstanding the unfortunate closure in this case, ocean energy research remains a priority area for the Government.  This is reflected in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 under which the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has committed to finalising the offshore renewable energy development plan and related strategic environmental assessment and natural impact assessment.  This will provide a clear framework for marine renewable energy project development.</p></reply>

I realise it is piloting this technology which the Minister included in the Action Plan for Jobs and Delivering Our Green Potential.  Several documents have been produced by bodies connected with the Government.  The NESC produced a document on the Climate Change Bill in which it stated Ireland's offshore wind energy resources offered a significant export opportunity.  When we are talking about frontier technology, it is clear that it takes time to develop.  Significant expertise has been built up by this flagship company.  I accept that it was in the development stage, but does the Minister accept that it is very short-sighted not to retain the expertise built up in this company over more than a decade?  It appears there were significant delays before the SEAI made a decision, which was part of the problem.  Does the Minister also accept that the loss of this frontier technology company costs us connections with other parts of the world in which there is a significant academic input into such work?  I question whether the Government is really serious about ocean or marine energy projects or whether it is just ticking boxes.  We all accept that it will take time to develop such projects, but when one loses a company with more than a dozen years of experience that has been able to leverage European and US funding, in addition to Irish funding, it does not bode well for the future in terms of the focused approach required.  I would like to hear about the Government's response about an area in which large numbers of jobs could be created and a new export industry could be created.</p></speech>

As I said in my initial reply, this sector has significant potential.  It is also one in which the risk is very high.  When allocating funds, any State body must do so in the knowledge that funds are limited and seek to support technologies that show the best promise.  Criteria will be set for the allocation of funding.  In this case, funding was provided for Wavebob by the SEAI and Enterprise Ireland - over &euro;1.8 million was invested in the project.  It is not the case, therefore, that there was no willingness to support it during the development phase.  From my Department's perspective, a commercial business plan must be presented before Enterprise Ireland would be willing to make a further investment.</p><p>That is the ultimate test.  Many technologies are being tested and developed and in some cases are in successful test-beds.  The development of a coherent strategy for ocean technologies is about seeking to create an environment in which technologies can be tested.  However, this does not mean every single case can be successfully supported in all circumstances.  While it is regrettable that this case did not meet the criteria for the allocation of additional funding, this is inevitable in an area such as ocean technology in which the technologies are wide-ranging and the risks are clearly very significant.</p></speech>

The issue of employment creation is one that is challenging all member states across the Union.  During our Presidency we have made progress in a number of areas that can create the right environment for growth and employment.  For example, agreement has been reached on the youth guarantee which promises to provide young people with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The European Globalisation Fund co-finances education and training support programmes for redundant workers.  The Irish Presidency will continue to progress the draft regulation governing a new funding round for the period 2014 to 2020.  Work is also continuing to obtain agreement on the European Union's new &euro;70 billion research programme, Horizon 2020, including the &euro;6.6 billion for key enabling technologies programmes and the proposed &euro;2 billion programme for competitiveness and SMEs, COSME.  I will be looking for every opportunity to further the interests of Irish and other SMEs and ensure they can extract the greatest possible benefit from the funding available under these programmes, particularly with regard to expanding the scope for participation in research and innovation activity.  Deputies will also be aware that Innovation Fund Ireland and the microfinance fund are part of the measures within the Action Plan for Jobs and these are helping Irish companies to access finance in the current difficult environment.</p><p>  Together with Government colleagues, I am also working to create a genuine digital single market by building confidence in cross-border transactions and services, including reform of data protection measures and providing a pan-European framework for e-signatures.  I will continue to fully engage in the development of the European Union's common commercial policies, which I believe provides a strong stimulus for growth and job creation.  Completing the trade agreement with Canada and launching the US negotiations would be an important step in boosting exports.  Next week I will host an informal meeting of EU competitiveness and research Ministers in Dublin, the focus of which will be measures to increase employment in the SME sector, including improving access to finance.  The recent agreement on the draft accounting directive will see a reduction of the administrative burden on firms.</p></reply>

Will his Department or the Department for Social Protection be the lead Department?  More importantly, where is the budget line for the implementation of the guarantee?  What is the current position on COSME?  Is an agreement on a budget for it imminent?  At the beginning of the Irish Presidency in January the Minister, the Taoiseach and others put great store in the fact that the Presidency would be a jobs-related one.  We are now in the final months of the Presidency, or the final stretch of the marathon.  How many jobs will have been created across Europe and here in Ireland as a result of Presidency initiatives?</p></speech>

If it can be negotiated and successfully launched, the figures indicate that 500,000 jobs could be created across the European Union and, proportionately, 4,000 in Ireland.  Obviously, this will take time to deliver.  Similarly, completion of the trade agreements with Japan and Canada will be significant in terms of job creation.  These agreements could lead to the creation of 2 million jobs in Europe.  The completion of the digital market has been estimated to have had a very significant impact.  A  figue of up to 4% of GDP could be generated by having an effective digital market.  Many of these initiatives have associated job targets, but they tend to be longer term, pending completion of a range of measures.</p><p>A fund of &euro;6 billion has been earmarked for the youth guarantee scheme for the 2014-20 period.  As the fund is for areas such as apprenticeships and job placement, the primary initiative will be with the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection.  COSME has a budget of just over &euro;2 billion and a formal set of proposals will be developed.</p></speech>

We are seeing a lost generation of young people leaving our shores.  People have referred to the reduced voter turnout in the Meath East by-election, but if one looks at the statistics, one will see that approximately 5% of the electorate have left the constituency owing to emigration.  This shows how serious the jobs issue is.</p><p>  Will funding for the youth guarantee scheme be dependent on the European Union?  When will the scheme happen and is the Government of a mind to push ahead with a youth guarantee scheme if there is no EU funding or if there is a waiting period?  We made a strong point at the joint committee that a youth should not just be provided with training and reactivation programmes but that a job should be part of the opportunity.</p></speech>

It is not a phenomenon that is peculiar to Ireland.  Austerity has had a massive impact on the level of youth unemployment across Europe.  The retail sector has traditionally been a great outlet for young people to start off in jobs.  There was a time when it also provided a secondary job for many women.  It is now becoming a primary occupation and source of income for many households.  Will the Minister admit that as long as austerity continues, it will be difficult for the retail sector to recover and job losses to be reversed?</p></speech>

It might be better for Deputies to table questions to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on the operation of the scheme.  I understand programmes will be developed at EU level, with national governments seeking to develop initiatives within programme guidelines.  As always, EU funds will be supplemented by national contributions in the draw-down.  The Minister for Social Protection can give Deputies additional data on the development of the scheme.</p><p>  The retail sector is, undoubtedly, a very important employer.  The Government has shown that it is alert to the needs of the sector through cuts in PRSI and VAT, the readjustment of wage settlement mechanisms, its new initiative to get businesses to go online and the initiative of the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, to reform licensing arrangements for retail businesses.  Deputy Mick Wallace is correct that a recovery in demand is crucial and the Government has been building a sustainable basis on which to rebuild the economy.  That involves correcting the public finances, as well as an expansion into export markets and building employment.  We are seeing the creation of, on average, 1,000 jobs per month in the private sector.  We are building a strong economy which can support a retail sector.  It is work in progress and a great deal remains to be done.</p></speech>

MFI has just compiled its report for the first six months of the scheme's operation, from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013.  The full report will be published shortly on my Department's website and the website of Microfinance Ireland.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, it is my intention to ensure reports will in future be compiled on a quarterly basis.</p><p>When presenting the legislation to the Oireachtas, the Government indicated that over the lifetime of the ten-year scheme it was expected that over &euro;90 million in additional lending would be provided to 5,500 microenterprises with the creation of an expected 7,700 jobs.  From the report of the first six months of operation, of the 149 applications received by Microfinance Ireland, some 44 were approved, 58 were declined, 13 were withdrawn, two were appealed and 32 are works in progress.  To the end of March, the scheme has supported 116 jobs and 44 microenterprises.</p><p> This is a new scheme and it has yet to achieve its potential.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has been actively promoting the scheme in the context of area meetings he is conducting across the country as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  He is also taking the opportunity to meet the local enterprise offices that will promote the service in every county to discuss its promotion and their experience with it.  The Minister has discussed its progress with the chair of Microfinance Ireland and he is shortly meeting Microfinance Ireland to evaluate its experience and how the scheme can be made more accessible.  The key to promotion of the take-up of this, and other initiatives, is the establishment of the first stop shop at local level.  Work on this is well advanced and the new approach will soon be rolled out in a number of early mover centres.</p><p> Microfinance Ireland is a private limited company, a subsidiary of Social Finance Foundation, SFF.  Its day to day costs are an operational matter for the company and the board.  In accordance with the provisions of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act, the accounts of the company will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be laid before the Oireachtas.  The cost for 2012 was &euro;461,000, which includes one-off set-up costs of &euro;278,000.</p><p> With regard to the cost of both microfinance and the credit guarantee schemes, Exchequer gains in terms of employment sustained and created, savings on welfare payments and increased direct and indirect tax payments have been calculated at &euro;23,000 per job.  On this basis, I am satisfied that the costs of both schemes have already been more than offset.  In respect of leveraging additional private sector funds to supplement the State's injection in MFI, MFI through its parent SFF has begun discussions with three banks about leveraging further funds this year.</p></reply>

Many questions have been referred to different Departments and there is a suggestion in the replies that we should table questions to different Ministers.  The whole notion of the Action Plan for Jobs was a whole of Government approach.  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and other Deputies cannot be coming in to the Chamber three days every week trying to ask questions of individual Ministers.  Is there some way we can co-ordinate questions so that the Minister of State with responsibility for jobs can bring the information back?  We can discuss this again.</p><p>  I did not get the exact figure for the money lent.  Some 116 jobs were created.  Advertisements have started running to promote the micro-finance scheme only in the past two weeks even though we are six months into it.  Since it was launched, I have been calling for wider promotion of the scheme.  Yesterday, at a meeting of the jobs committee in Ballinasloe, the feedback on the scheme was that it is too expensive.  I have said this before and I am aware of the issue concerning unsecured loans, which means it must be expensive.  However, it is more expensive than what the banks are charging.</p><p>  A point that can be addressed quicker is the three-year payback.  Many people are reluctant to commit to a three-year payback given where their businesses are.  If that issue can be examined, it may make the scheme more accessible.  There remains a complete lack of awareness about the scheme.  It is too expensive and the conditions frighten people away.  What is the target in terms of the delivery of jobs?  Has the target been revised downwards given the poor take-up to date?</p></speech>

The Minister will launch the roll out of the one-stop-shop in every facility and obviously its promotion is very important.  That will probably generate engagement on the ground.  In regard to the cost of the scheme, it is a not-for-profit one.  The rate is at 8.8%.  There is a high risk to the loan.  People have been refused by the banks.  Very good evaluation is being carried out.  To ensure it is successful, it is very important there is a level of monitoring for the applicant once he or she gets the funding.  It is not the intention to erase current bank lending but loans for less than &euro;25,000 are available for sole traders who cannot avail of conventional banking.</p><p> People with start-up companies are delighted to get it.  There was a company in my office last evening which is very much depending on getting the &euro;25,000-----</p></speech>

When the Government came to power it said it would create 100,000 net new jobs.  In fact, in the past year, 1,200 net new jobs were created.  It also said it would create 10,000 net new jobs in financial services but approximately 10,000 net jobs have been lost in this sector.  This week we heard about 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing but there is no net money being brought to the table in that regard.</p><p>  It is very important that we are honest and do not over-egg what is happening here.  In the press statement on this ten months ago, the Minister promised that &euro;19 million would be made available and that 7,700 new jobs would be created.  In his reply, the Minister said 116 jobs were supported.  He never once told us about the jobs created.  Has one job been created from this so far?  If he does not have that information now, can we put in place a mechanism whereby we can measure how many new jobs are created from this?</p></speech>

They are very much determined to support small companies.  People are using the simplified application procedure operated by Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks and they can appeal the banks' decisions.  The banks are clearly supporting viable companies and, naturally enough, are not supporting non-viable companies.</p><p>  It is very easy to come up with simplistic solutions but the problem is not that simple to resolve.  Obviously, one must have an understanding of the position of employers.  It is not just a case of getting money to establish a job, as the company must have sufficient capacity and a sufficient base.</p></speech>

One might say people between 18 and 21 have chosen to take a few years out and travel the world but many people emigrating are my age and older, and they include people with children.  People are taking children out of school and emigrating because both parents cannot get jobs.  Emigration has a significant damaging effect on society.  It breaks up the families of those affected.  Significant milestones in life, such as birthdays, first Holy Communions and even weddings, happen thousands of miles away from grandparents.</p><p>  Emigration also has a negative economic effect because the youthful energetic element of the economy is being removed from it.  Football clubs are finding it hard to field teams.  The level of emigration and the pain and suffering it has caused can never be overestimated.  Emigration is a real problem and is happening daily on foot of the policies the Government is following.</p><p>  Proper job creation cannot happen in this State until we get growth levels above 2%.  This will not happen on the basis of depending on international markets.  The Government must step into the domestic market with investment.  Until this happens, we will see a stagnant labour force.  The second and important point is that the other element the Government can deal with is the costs faced by businesses, including utility and rental costs and professional fees.  These are not being tackled either.  The county enterprise boards have been in limbo since 2008 and we still have not seen the issue they face resolved.</p></speech>

It would be very simple if we could take that recipe on board.  Enterprise Ireland has had the best year ever, with exports by companies it supports topping &euro;16 billion.  At the showcase I attended in Drogheda today at 8.30 a.m., there were approximately 35 companies and they are very optimistic about the future.  It is a question of confidence.</p><p>We have two economies.  While the international economy is doing well, there is, without doubt, a great deal of pessimism about and a lack of confidence in the domestic economy.  There is a huge amount of money being saved in the economy because there is not the confidence to spend.  We have been left with the legacy of an over-supply of retail developments during the boom time.  The Government is doing all it can, including activating the new local enterprise offices and providing start-up funds.  The many initiatives taken by the Minister to support job creation are being taken on board.  It is easy for Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n to say nothing is being done, but the Government is doing everything it can to encourage innovation, research and development.  Despite what the Deputy says, the many small high potential start-up companies which I have met - I also meet people on the doorsteps - are very optimistic.  Has the Deputy met any of the high potential start-up companies?  While there are always problems in business, exports are increasing.  The Deputy did not recognise the figure of &euro;16 billion in exports achieved last year by Enterprise Ireland-supported companies and the expected &euro;1 billion in additional exports this year.</p></speech>

I have been informed by IDA Ireland that in County Donegal it supports 14 companies which employ 2,228 people in software development, systems development and the medical technology industry.  This represents an increase of 403 persons at work in IDA Ireland companies in the past two years, an increase of 20%.</p><p>  The industry base in County Donegal is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing client base to encourage it to transform and expand existing operations, while actively encouraging new investment in County Donegal in knowledge based industries and high-end manufacturing, mainly in companies in the medical technologies sector.  In October 2012 KeyedIn solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over three years.</p><p>  The challenge facing IDA Ireland is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment.  International competition for foreign direct investment has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure, as well as the availability of sophisticated, professional and business support services.  This does create difficulties for regional locations and IDA Ireland has to focus on the main regional urban centres which are where the interest of most visiting investors will focus.  IDA Ireland continues to seek every opportunity to bring investment to County Donegal.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has also assured me that it continues to focus on the designated linked gateway of Letterkenny-Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland which includes initiatives such as the north west business and technology zone, NWBTZ, which aims to promote the linked gateway of Letterkenny-Derry in line with the Northern Ireland regional development strategy 2025.</p><p><i>Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post-2014.  This analysis which will be undertaken later this year will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland's strengths in attracting foreign direct investment, changes to the European Union's state aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p></reply>

He has rightly pointed to how well existing IDA Ireland companies in County Donegal have been doing, 14 of which between them employ 2,228 workers, an increase of 400 or 20% in two years.  This shows the county is a place in which business can be done and that businesses which locate in the county can thrive.  However, during the past few years none of the new investments in the country have been attracted to County Donegal.  It attracted only one of the 88 new investments nationally last year.  Of the 61 new investments attracted to Ireland in the previous year, none was attracted to the county.</p><p>We have only had 13 visits by companies in the past five years.  That record is not good enough.  A report investigating the reason we are not getting our fair share of new investments is needed.  I have asked the CEO of IDA Ireland the question I am about to ask the Minister, to which I received a response that was non-committal.  That is reason I am putting it to the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  Will he commission a report on the reason for this poor performance in order that it can be addressed and County Donegal can attract its fair share of new investments in the country?</p></speech>

A 20% increase in employment in IDA Ireland companies is a good performance in my book.  It probably exceeds the performance achieved in most, if not all, other counties.  It is a strong performance.  I agree that we continually need to examine our strategy and IDA Ireland will undertake an indepth analysis of our FDI strategy to inform its formulation for the period after 2014.  We continually examine the sectors in which we can seize opportunities.  As the Deputy will have noted, earlier in the week I launched our strategy for manufacturing which has the capacity to have a better regional spread.  If one examines the make-up of IDA Ireland investments in recent times, there is no doubt that the investments being attracted are in sectors in which there are very deep labour market pools.  There is a focus on urban centres, but there is also a real opportunity to develop existing and new sectors.  Manufacturing is a sector that has further potential which we will be examining, but one cannot pick out one county and say, for example, that one has a strategy for County Donegal.  We need to have a strategy for Ireland to win foreign investment and then we need to position the regions to have a competitive advantage whereby they can win investors.  That is the approach and we will certainly actively continue to market County Donegal and position our overall policy to create employment in foreign owned companies.</p></speech>

However, last year 75% of investments in FDI projects were in these cities.  Only 9% were outside Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick.  The Government plays a role in this regard.  One might sometimes say it is market-led, but the botox firm located in County Mayo did not choose to locate in that county on the basis that the well turned out people of County Mayo meant it was a good place in which to locate such a firm.  German financial firms did not locate in the docklands in Dublin because they thought it was a good place from which to do business.  Governments can orientate FDI companies, but it takes political will to do so.</p></speech>

Will the Minister arrange for the carrying out of a simple exercise, an assessment of the poor performance in regard to first-time investments?  We have seen a number of actions by the Government in recent times which have made it more difficult to attract new jobs to my county.  We have seen the Minister downgrade the IDA Ireland office in Letterkenny and remove gateway status from the town.  There is also a much reduced commitment to the A5 project.  There is obviously something that has resulted in County Donegal receiving less than its fair share of new investments compared to other parts of the country.  If there are impediments, it is important that they be outlined and addressed in order that those of us involved in the political system can ensure they are tackled over time.  I ask the Minister to conduct the simple task of commissioning a report on the reason there has not been the same level of performance in County Donegal considering the number attracted to the country.</p></speech>

They fall within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar. </p><p>  There are no specific measures in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs related to parking in town centres.  However, I am aware that the impact of parking restrictions has emerged as a concern for some retailers in town centres and this concern has recently been outlined to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation by RGDATA.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures which will support the retail sector, including an initiative to introduce a single portal for business licence applications, a new scheme to help more businesses to trade online and the integration of local business supports into a stronger local enterprise office network to provide better supports for micro and small businesses.  My Department will also be chairing an indepartmental committee to consider what measures might be taken to assist the sector in the short term, for example, in the context of budget 2014 or next year's Action Plan for Jobs.  In that context, I will ask my officials to examine the recent paper which I have seen on town centre parking prepared by RGDATA in consultation with the Departments with relevant policy responsibility for this issue.</p></reply>

While they do not fall directly under the jurisdiction of the Minister of State some issues arise from the way this is distorting retail competition.  Retailers in town centres are forced to put up with these charges while they do not affect those out of town.  There are many other issues surrounding this, with policies differing between towns and counties, and often between streets within a town.  It is important that the interdepartmental committee consider this and I look forward to hearing further from the Minister of State about it.</p></speech>

Many shops in towns are closed.  The local government grants which used to fund local authorities have been reduced over the years and local authorities must generate funds from car parking fees.  That pressure would not be there if the Government funded local authorities properly.  Will the Minister of State consider the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal for a progressive commercial rate that takes into consideration the profitability of the business such that more profitable businesses pay higher commercial rates?  In the North of Ireland we brought in a commercial rate which shifted the burden from small businesses to the larger out-of-town shops.  There is no strategic plan for most town centres.  Local authorities and the new local enterprise offices should be sitting down with the retailers in every town in the country and developing a strategic plan to see how they can grow in a healthy, sustainable and uniform manner.</p></speech>

Retail Excellence Ireland published a report stating that the introduction of the property tax has negatively impacted on retail sales during the first part of the year and in its quarterly barometer the retail lobby group said that overall sales across the sector continued to disappoint during the first quarter.  Given that the property tax is not based on ability to pay does it not worry the Government that it is further reducing disposable income which is impacting directly on jobs in these town centres and shop units?</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is examining the management of local government.  The local enterprise offices will consider every aspect of business and there will be business representation on those committees.  A total of 65% of all property tax will be retained.  The tax base will be broader whereas until now it was only the business people who paid rates.  Local authorities will have more autonomy and discretion to give a derogation to a vacant unit to allow somebody occupy it without paying rates.  That will be considered under the new management structure in every local authority where elected members will have far more say in what they want to do to promote business especially in town centres.</p></speech>

It is important to encourage activity in town centres and offer variety.  Some retailers are doing exceptionally well in certain town centres.  Where the owners or proprietors personally manage shops they can do quite well but the multiple retailers and discounters have grown dramatically over the period too.</p></speech>

This relates to the availability of fodder for our cattle and is particularly acute in the dairy sector and in high intensity farming.  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Moynihan raised this last week.  Yesterday I met the Bothar Bu&iacute; co-operative and spoke to farmers who express huge frustration that there does not appear to be a sense at national level that farmers are really in an unprecedented crisis.</p></speech>

Cows would normally have been out on the grass for a long time by now but they are indoors.  I met the chairman of the farmers' committee of IRD Duhallow yesterday who told me that by his estimate 90% of farmers in the Duhallow area are without feed.  I saw on television the Dairygold Co-operative purchasing fodder for its suppliers across that region at exorbitant prices.</p><p>  The transport costs incurred by co-operatives helping their suppliers to source fodder have serious implications.  Credit facilities and lines are breaking down.  There is no fodder left in the country which is very serious.  The farming community is concerned that this point has not got across to people at national level, in government or in the Oireachtas.  The human toll is beginning to mount.  Some farmers have been hospitalised and mental health problems are growing.  People do not know where to turn.</p><p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the fodder situation is a national crisis?  Will he establish a national co-ordinating group or task force involving all stakeholders immediately with a view to addressing the issue in the short term and coming up with solutions and coming to the assistance of farmers?  Will he establish a fodder aid scheme to assist farmers who are in deep trouble and see no end in sight?</p></speech>

Obviously, significant numbers of farmers have contacted my constituency office about the matter.  I met the president of the ICMSA, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the other morning about it and have had representatives of the IFA, Irish Farmers Association, on to me on numerous occasions.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was very open about this issue last week on national radio and many occasions since.  It has arisen because of the hardness of the weather for several months.  As any farmer will tell the Deputy, farmers have been waiting for some natural heat to bring on growth.  The issue is of acute concern in quite a number of cases.  The next few days and weeks will be critical for farmers, for whom sourcing fodder is a key priority.</p><p>  The first priority is that farmers should have access to fodder for their animals.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is aware - if he is not, he should be - the relationship between farmers and their animals is very close.  One will recall the plight of a poor farmer in Athlone whose cattle were stranded and went to extraordinary lengths to see they had fodder.  It is an issue of the farming community caring for animals in the best way possible.  I saw the television pictures of the 75 loads of hay coming in from England.  The Minister and his Department have been quite open about this matter and want to hear from farmers who have acute fodder shortage difficulties.  They have encouraged the co-operatives which have been flexible with providing credit for affected farmers to give them favourable deals, selling fodder at cost price.  Feed is being sourced and will be provided for any farmer who has run short.  One cannot wait with animals in a case when there is no fodder available.</p><p>  A relatively small number of farmers have contacted the Department, despite the request to do so, if they were in acute need.  Listening to farmers, I note the co-operative spirit is very strong.  Farmers who still have silage left have helped others who do not.  Available fodder is being shared, while other fodder is being sourced.  The Minister and the Department have been in regular contact with the banks, the co-ops and the feed merchants urging flexibility and co-operation in order that farmers who need it can have access to fodder, be it silage or meal.  The Minister will again meet the chief executives of the co-ops and the representatives of the banks tomorrow when he will again urge the greatest degree of flexibility and support for farmers in distress.  Both the banks and the co-ops have urged farmers to contact them to discuss the terms they have available.</p></speech>

They have indicated flexibility and support will be available for farmers affected.  Teagasc is dispensing substantial amounts of technical and nutritional information on fodder needs arising from the severe and harsh weather conditions that have prevailed since the close of summer in 2012.  Teagasc advisers are working with farmers to provide advice on the best options available to them.</p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture has been calling for a &euro;10 million fodder fund.  Farmers have not been seeking such a fund.  What they have been seeking is flexibility, co-operation and access to fodder.  It is in these areas that the Minister, the Department, Teagasc and the co-ops are working very hard to see to it that the farming community and animals get through this difficult period safely.</p></speech>

There is a real crisis.  What concerns me about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply is that he uses every word but &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;.  He says the Minister is open.  He used the words &ldquo;acute concern&rdquo;, &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; and &ldquo;challenging&rdquo;.  The Minister did the same last week, but there is a determined effort to avoid use of the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, as if uttering it would mean the Taoiseach would have to take some action.  He mentioned everyone but the Government is taking some action on this issue.  There is a credit problem which is looming and getting worse for the millers, co-operatives and farmers.</p><p>  I asked the Taoiseach three questions.  Did he accept there was a crisis?  He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The farmers I met yesterday were very clear that there was a crisis.  Everyone knows that if those who take decisions do not accept there is a crisis, it impacts on the urgency and nature of their response.  </p><p>  I asked if the Taoiseach would set up a national task force to bring all stakeholders together to develop a national response to the crisis for many farmers who are in difficulty through no fault of their own.  I accept the matter has to do with negative climatic conditions.  However, the unprecedented nature of these climatic conditions justifies a national response led by the Government in bringing all stakeholders together.  It is not too much to ask the Taoiseach to put together a national group to lead a proper, co-ordinated response to the crisis.  Paying &euro;135 a bale, as the Dairygold Co-operative Society has had to, is not an answer.  I met a farmer yesterday with 100 cows who had enough feed to last only until today.  The crisis so far will have cost the average farmer with 70 cows up to &euro;20,000.</p></speech>

The co-ops have told us that they are playing their role but that they are concerned about the banks.  They are doing their very best to help their suppliers.  Teagasc is also playing its role.  The problem, however, is that it is giving professional advice but farmers involved are at the pinnacle of animal husbandry.  These are good farmers who have taken good advice all along the way.  However, last summer&rsquo;s weather conditions and the extended winter period have impacted on the amount of feed available.  What happened at the back end of the year will present another problem because of the extended winter period.</p></speech>

In some areas such as Duhallow, County Cork, there will be a 50% cut in milk yields.  This will reduce farmers&rsquo; capacity to take advantage of good milk prices.  The implications are fundamental for an industry and a sector for which we have great hopes.  The Taoiseach should set up a task force.  In the past, when there were isolated flooding incidents, fodder aid schemes were produced by former Ministers, including by Deputy Brendan Smith and Joe Walsh in 1999.</p></speech>

Has the Taoiseach accepted the result of the Croke Park II ballot?  Does he accept that Croke Park II is now off the table?  Does he now accept that the big stick approach of issuing threats and diktats to public sector workers has failed?  Will he definitively state that the Government threat to cut pay by 7% across the board is now off the table?  This process must be a real renegotiation rather than a face-saving exercise or a tweaking.  It cannot be like Lisbon II or Nice II.  He cannot continue to ask workers to vote again until they give him the answer he wants.  Is it a case of back to the drawing board?  Is the Taoiseach genuinely open to new ideas and other ways to close the deficit?</p></speech>

That does not alter the fact that the figures and the arithmetic remain the same.  There is a requirement to achieve a saving of &euro;300 million this year from within the public payroll bill, rising to &euro;1 billion by 2015.  In the first instance the Government has decided to ask the LRC to engage with the unions, having published the Revised Estimates, including the requirement clearly set out by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has the full backing of the Government in this matter, to determine whether there is a basis for discussion and negotiation.  The Government expects to get a response to that engagement inside two weeks.</p></speech>

He did not answer any of them, with the exception of one.  He is making it clear that Croke Park II is still on the table, and I can only take from his answers that he has asked the LRC to engage with unions and workers on that basis.  Obviously, the Taoiseach hopes there can be some face-saving or tweaking of this agreement.  I would not share that view.  We should remember that when this deal was produced, the Government agreed, alongside the trade unions, that a process of ratification would be entered into.  He voluntarily agreed to the notion that workers should be balloted on this agreement.  The workers have rejected the agreement by a decisive majority.</p><p>  When does &quot;No&quot; mean &quot;No&quot;?  Why can the Taoiseach not accept that democratic verdict?  He said he has to save &euro;300 million.  So be it, but there are other ways in which he can raise &euro;300 million.  It does not have to be at the expense of front-line workers.  It does not have to be a result of hammering the public services.</p></speech>

What exactly does that mean?  Is he asking it to test the ground with the unions to see whether they can run the vote again?  Is that the Taoiseach's thinking?  Given that he is hell-bent on finding this &euro;300 million, why does the Taoiseach put himself in a type of policy straitjacket?  Why will he not look beyond the proposals in Croke Park II to other initiatives that could raise those moneys fairly?  Perhaps there is an argument for a proportion of that to come from the cosseted upper echelons of the public sector, but low- and middle-income workers and front-line workers have told the Government definitively that they have no more to give.  Has the Taoiseach heard that?  Does he understand it?  Why will he not allow the LRC to open up the discussion in a genuine, open-minded way and listen to the proposals that many of the trade unions will bring forward as to how he might gather the &euro;300 million?

The Government was disappointed with the outcome of the vote, which, on the basis of the negotiated proposals before the trade unions, ensured that those who earned the most paid the most and that the core pay of the 87% of public workers who earn less than &euro;65,000 were not affected.</p><p>  The Deputy's party has had views about the way in which this should be dealt with.  I remind her of her proposal before the last election for &euro;3 billion in tax increases, which would have been catastrophic for this country, deprived people of any opportunity to work and left marginal rates at an exceptionally high level.</p></speech>

Her death was one the most eminent obstetrician in the country has said could have been avoided had she been granted the termination she requested.  Instead, she was left in agony with her treatment delayed until she was, basically, at death's door, because of the failure of successive governments to legislate and because of the obscene distinction between protecting a woman's life and protecting her health, a distinction the Minister for Justice and Equality correctly said has resulted in some citizens' being more equal than others.  While there is no impediment to the protection of men's lives, health or general well-being, in the case of pregnant women that is a qualified right.</p><p>  One would think, in a civilised society in which it has been found that an innocent woman has died unnecessarily and in which half of the population are not guaranteed an equal right to health, that the Taoiseach would be spurred into action.  Instead, we had the spectacle at the weekend of talk of Spanish inquisitions and of suicidal women being brought before tribunals of three, four or six inquisitors to adjudicate on their mental health.  That discussion was of itself insulting to women and their doctors.  I was going to ask the Taoiseach what he has against women, but I will confine myself to three simple questions on the issue of maternal well-being.</p><p>  On the day Savita Halappanavar's inquest finished, an inquest opened in Dublin into the death of Bimbo Onanuga, a Nigerian woman who died in the Rotunda three years ago.  This woman's family had to fight for that inquest.  Given the useful information that came out of the Halappanavar inquest, which can be used to inform our maternity services in future years, will the Taoiseach consider moving to amend the Coroners Act to ensure there is an automatic inquest into a case of death in our maternity hospitals?  Will he, against the backdrop of recent commissioned research which reveals a disproportionate number of deaths among women not born in Ireland - 40% of maternal deaths occur to women not born in Ireland - examine the situation and the data protection information in our hospitals?  Finally, will he ensure that, without delay, legislation is brought before this House to provide for abortion where the life of a woman is in danger, including a risk of suicide, on the advice of not more than two medical practitioners publicly available in our health service with State-wide access?</p></speech>

In all the comments I have made about any of these matters, I have tried to be as understanding of the position as one can be.  The situation is that there is no need for some of the language I have heard in the past, based purely on speculation, dealing with the lives of women and the lives of their unborn children.  That language is not necessary.  It should not be the case that anybody in this country refers to women as being some kind of impediment to their children and to the lives of their children.  This is much too serious an issue for that kind of glib comment and I do not accept it from Deputy Daly.</p><p>  The tragic circumstances that arose in Galway can never bring back Savita Halappanavar to her husband, who has lost his wife and her unborn child.  The jury and the coroner's inquest concluded with a unanimous verdict of medical misadventure and the jury adopted unanimously the nine recommendations made by the coroner, Dr. Ciar&aacute;n McLoughlin, who conducted the inquest with a very high degree of professional competence.  The HSE is considering the recommendations made by the coroner and some of them are already under way as part of the ongoing clinical and patient safety initiatives within the HSE - for example, the introduction of an early warning system for obstetrics and gynaecology nationally.  The HSE presented the final draft report to the solicitor for Mr. Halappanavar on 29 March for his observations and his feedback and I understand the chairman, who is independent of the investigation team, offered to meet Mr. Halappanavar whenever appropriate.  Arrangements have been made to set up that meeting.</p><p>  I do not have the details with regard to the inquest to which Deputy Daly referred in Dublin.  I suggest the Deputy request a Topical Issue discussion in respect of the data protection issues.</p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's third question on legislation with regard to the issue of circumstances in which there is a real and substantial threat to the life of a woman, that matter is under active consideration by the Government.  When the Government decides to approve the heads of that Bill, it will be sent to the all-party Oireachtas committee for its observations and for preparation of the legislation involved.</p></speech>

The words "active consideration" tell me nothing.  This House deserves that the legislation be enacted as quickly as possible, because the findings of the inquest left no doubt whatsoever.  The finding was that this woman was subjected to serious and shocking mismanagement of her treatment and that she was denied and deprived of proper medical treatment when she needed it.  Dr. Peter Boylan has been very clear that the only thing that could have saved her early on was the granting of a termination when she requested it.</p><p>  I do not know what the Taoiseach is waiting for.  Is he waiting for his daughter, my daughter or someone else's wife to be in the same horrendous circumstance that Savita's husband described?  Abortion is a health issue.  It is a human rights issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has clearly stated - and I agree with him - that this is also an issue of equality.  I am not sure why the Taoiseach feels women's lives are less valuable than men's or why their health should be unnecessarily put at risk.  That is what the findings delivered.</p><p>  I have submitted a lot of questions about Bimbo Onanuga and about the compilation of our maternal mortality rates, which are at variance with the figures.  The real figures show a higher rate than that indicated by the Central Statistics Office.  This is a concern for all of us.  At best, our figures equate to the EU average, rather than the rates we are always sounding on about.  I will raise the issues, but the Taoiseach, as the key person in the State representing half of the population, might like to fast-track some of them.</p><p>Information which can be gleaned in coroners' reports and public hearings can inform our medical practice for the benefit of all women in the years to come.  Delays in that regard do not help anybody.</p></speech>

She is well aware that each case involves the life of the mother and the life of the unborn.  The process the Government is involved in, as it follows through on the expert report, clearly takes some little time.  The information meetings held by an Oireachtas committee are feeding into the preparation of the heads of a Bill to deal with this matter in a sensitive, compassionate and understanding manner and in the right way.  When the Government clears the heads of the Bill, it will send them to the committee for a full-scale debate so that this issue can be dealt with comprehensively and in the right way.  This issue has divided Irish society on a number of occasions in the past 30 years.  There are two lives involved here - the life of the mother and the life of the unborn.  It is not a matter to be treated flippantly, glibly or with the kind of remarks made by Deputy Daly.</p></speech>

The report sets out the progress made by Government during its second year in office.  It shows a Government that is working hard for the people and with the people to rebuild our country and restore Ireland's reputation.  While the programme of work ahead is formidable, the Government has achieved much in terms of stabilising the economy and unemployment levels, creating the climate and competitiveness for growth, reducing the cost of the EU-IMF bailout and correcting the public finances.  Progress on these issues is critical for future economic stability and growth.  There are positive signs that the difficult work is paying off and confidence is returning.  Investment in new jobs by foreign firms continues to grow.  Exporting companies reported their highest jobs gain since 2006.  The value of exported goods is at its highest since 2002.  Borrowing is on track to fall below the 3% of GDP target by 2015.  The economy has returned to modest growth for two years running.  Long-term Government bond yields are at their lowest since before this crisis.  We have had success in negotiating the promissory note deal with the troika.  Our EU partners have agreed an extension of our borrowings.  That is another factor.</p><p>  The programme for Government is a detailed and ambitious programme of work for the Government over its five-year term.  The Government is making good progress on implementing its commitments.  Some of them will take longer and will be delivered over the lifetime of the Government.  In the two reports published so far, the Government has reported progress on two thirds of its commitments.  I will list some of the commitments that were delivered during 2012.  The new Intreo service was launched to help get people back into employment.  Some 11 Intreo offices have been opened under the direction of the Minister for Social Protection, including those in Arklow, Coolock, Buncrana, Tallaght and Killarney.  A further 20 offices are to be opened in 2013 and the remainder will be opened during 2014.  There has been a continued focus on job creation.  Some 92% of the 2012 jobs action plan has been implemented.  A &euro;2.25 billion stimulus in job-rich public infrastructure projects has been secured.  Among the key projects are up to 20 new primary care centres, new and replacement school buildings, the new DIT campus at Grangegorman and the new State pathology laboratory.  Some &euro;850 million is being provided to upgrade the national motorway and primary route network.  Those projects are going through the process of the stimulus programme preparations in the PPP system.</p><p>  The children's rights referendum, which strengthens children's constitutional rights, was passed last year.  Work is well under way on the establishment of the new child and family agency, with draft legislation expected to come to the Government shortly.  Ms Norah Gibbons was recently appointed as the first chairperson of the board.  A suite of legislation was enacted to enhance child protection in relation to Garda vetting and the reporting of abuse.  The future roadmap was published, setting out key reforms to be delivered for universal health insurance.  The national carers' strategy was published to acknowledge and support the work of carers.  The Constitutional Convention was established - it has met three times to date - to give people an opportunity to have a real say in reforming our Constitution.  New personal insolvency legislation was enacted to radically reform bankruptcy law and help distressed borrowers to resolve their debts while remaining in their family homes.  An action plan for the fundamental reform of the local government system - to make it more efficient, effective and democratic - was published.  A local government Bill is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.</p><p>  Over the next 12 months, the Government will continue to work to reduce borrowing levels and sustain investor confidence in this country.  We will continue to place a strong focus on creating more jobs while making sure, as far as possible, that new jobs go to people on the live register.  We will do more to accelerate progress to address the mortgage crisis to ensure individuals and families are offered sustainable solutions.  The Government will continue its reform agenda across the political system and the public service while protecting front-line services.  The Government entered into a five-year plan.  Each Minister will keep working to implement that plan.  I have no plans to revise or renegotiate the programme for Government, or to introduce a new programme.  There is more than enough work to keep everyone busy for the next three years.</p></reply>

He did not address the real meat of the programme for Government - the wishful thinking that was contained and listed in the programme.  There has been an indication, particularly on the part of the Minister for Social Protection, that the penny is beginning to drop with this Government at long last, after two years of pursuing Fianna F&aacute;il policies.  I hope it will be catching and the Minister, Deputy Burton, might be able to persuade the Taoiseach that austerity is not working here or in the EU as a whole.  Unemployment has remained steadfast at 14%.  I do not how the Taoiseach can praise that, or suggest it is a great thing.  Unemployment needs to come down.  Emigration records are at an all-time high.  The domestic economy remains on the floor.  I urge the Taoiseach to change direction.  He should listen to what the Minister, Deputy Burton, is telling him at the moment, which is that austerity is not working and will not work at EU or national levels.</p><p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that many parts of the programme for Government have been binned by the Government even though it was elected on the basis of its promises?  Does he accept that it has failed to implement the programme for Government that it placed before the House after the election?  I have asked the Taoiseach previously about the commitment in the programme for Government with regard to upward-only rent reviews for existing leases, which was supposed to be a key component of the Government efforts to get businesses back to work and retain businesses throughout the country.  Will the Government publish the legal advice to which it keeps referring to the effect that it cannot proceed with legislation to address this problem?  Regardless of whether that advice is published, will the Government ask the Constitutional Convention or an expert group to examine this issue and try to find some way around the supposed constitutional problems in this respect?</p><p>  I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the Government's record on health.  He mentioned how great the Government has been at implementing the programme for Government, but in this area it has missed deadlines and broken promises.</p><p>All we have seen is the primary care debacle.  The Government has also failed to live up to its commitment to provide for free drugs under the long-term illness scheme and the high-tech drugs scheme.  The Government said it would publish a White Paper on universal health insurance.  When is that coming?  Is it coming, or is it just another one of those failed promises?</p><p> It is good to see the Minister for Social Protection next to the Taoiseach in the House, because this also relates to her.  The Taoiseach said there were many commitments in the programme for Government.  One of those commitments was that the Government would protect the vulnerable and another was that it would maintain social welfare rates.  Social welfare rates have not been maintained if, for example, one asks lone parents, considers what the Government has done with child benefit or jobseeker's benefit - under which the number of months for which a person is entitled to the payment have been reduced - or looks at the fuel allowance or the household benefits package.  They are all social welfare payments and every one of them has been attacked.</p><p> The Taoiseach said in regard to other-----</p></speech>

Disability was one of the key platforms during the election and also in the programme for Government, which states: "We will ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced and that resources allocated reach the people who need them."  Yet on this issue we have seen, time after time, that the Government has gone after people with disabilities.  Those people have sometimes managed to force the Government to reverse the decisions it has made but it has not, as yet, reversed the decision to cut the respite care grant, reversed its cuts to the adaptation grant or said it will not abolish the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance grant, which the Government recently announced it would cut.  Is it now time to publish a new document that the Taoiseach can stand over and that is achievable, rather than the fairy tale that is contained within the current one?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300022#U00400"><p>I do not accept Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's assertions at all.  What I gave him were some of the actions that have been taken and implemented during the course of the past number of months that are having an impact on our problems here.</p><p>  I had the opportunity to visit Sligo with the Minister for Social Protection to open one of the first Intreo offices.  The office contains a combination of personnel from the Department of Social Protection and the HSE, along with community welfare officers.  For the first time, I saw the value of an integrated system under which people with different experiences are able to deal with persons who are unfortunately unemployed, in whatever category they may be.  The live register, far from being some sort of instrument under which people just go and receive the dole, is a resource dealing with people who have an enormous range of skills and competence and who, in the vast majority, are willing and want to work.  In contrast to the old system under which people would go in to sign on and draw money, there is now the opportunity for group interviews and individual interviews to see what their experience, talents and particular areas of expertise might be, to see what their wishes and ambitions are, and to try to fit those into the opportunities that are being created and will arise in the time ahead.  I must say genuinely to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that I detected a sense of energy and enthusiasm I had never seen before in social welfare offices, which are now called Intreo offices.  Another group of these offices are to be opened in 2013, and the Minister for Social Protection is in very close contact with the Office of Public Works and reports to Cabinet on the progress being made to ensure this can become a reality.</p><p>  The spend on social protection is &euro;20.3 billion.  This is money that goes directly into the economy in all its various sectors and phases.  It is true to say the Government has kept its commitment in honouring core pay rates.  It is a commitment that has and will be honoured and it is a very important element.</p><p>  The number on the live register on 19 April was 420,000.  Less than one year ago, people were talking about the number exceeding 500,000.  This is much too high but it is an impressive response from the Minister for Social Protection and across the Government in the opportunities that are being created.  The question and challenge for the Government is to deal effectively with the live register.  That is why I am glad to note that, with the continued line of strong investment coming into the country, the Department of Social protection now has a competent potential employee list that is available for any body, whether Enterprise Ireland-backed small and medium enterprises, foreign direct investment in the form of multinationals or otherwise.  Such bodies now have available to them a resource within any locality.  People have been more than surprised at the quality and range of talent and expertise that exists out there.</p><p>  The question of upward-only rent reviews is something the Government has not been able to deal with.  This was an intention of Government but, as I have said before, the formal legal advice from the Attorney General was very clear in that regard.</p><p>  I ask Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh whether I missing something here.  Last year, 2012, was the most successful year for job creation by the IDA since 2006.  I had the opportunity to engage with American investment personnel in Washington, New York and right across to the west coast, from Seattle down to San Francisco.  Among the biggest companies that have invested here in the recent past are Apple, PayPal, Eli Lilly, Amgen, SAP, Cisco and, from Ireland, the Kerry Group.  More than 13,600 new jobs were created in 2012, some 12,500 of which were created by IDA clients, which was the biggest number ever.  We have also put in place the &euro;19 million microenterprise loan fund scheme, which we hope will create more than 7,000 jobs.  By the end of March, that scheme had supported 44 microenterprises and 116 jobs from the approximately 149 applications that were received.  There was the launch of the &euro;450 million credit guarantee scheme, which has the potential to create 4,000 jobs, and over &euro;3.1 million was guaranteed under that scheme by the end of March.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, will know, one of the crying complaints I get is that small and medium-sized enterprises have no access to credit.  This scheme was created as part of the infrastructure to help small and medium-sized enterprises to do their business and to expand.  That is why we also published legislation to make it easier for viable SMEs to restructure their loans.  Some &euro;300 million has now been invested in seven new world-class research centres that are to be located in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin and will support more than 800 scientists-----</p></speech>

Yesterday, I attended the all-party Oireachtas committee in the west dealing with jobs and job creation, the retail trade, the black economy and so on.  It is only when people engage with front-line practitioners and people who are involved that they hear of the opportunities out there and discover where the blockages and impediments in the system are.  That committee has been dealing with some real and relevant issues.</p><p>One might say that one of the issues taken in hand by the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy Perry, is the complexity and difficulty involved in small and medium enterprises setting up businesses and keeping them going.  It involves the number of licences they must apply for and the red tape, bureaucracy and cost involved in that.  By the end of this year, there will be a single portal for applications for small and medium enterprises to save them money and spare them red tape and bureaucracy.  This was done in Chicago and Singapore and will hopefully be piloted in a number of areas throughout the country by the end of this year.  They are some of the issues.</p><p> Clearly, the &euro;20 billion in savings over the next ten years from the promissory note agreement was important, as were the liquidation of IBRC and Irish Nationwide, the ending of the bank guarantee scheme, deposits returning to Irish banks, the disposal of the State's &euro;1 billion holding in the Bank of Ireland at a profit of &euro;10 million, the sale of Irish Life for &euro;1.3 billion with an additional dividend of &euro;40 million paid to the State and the establishment of a new bank resolution fund to protect against future instability.  These are important issues.  </p><p> As I said in response to an earlier question, I would like to think that the stimulus package announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform last year will result in due course in a serious number of jobs in the construction of primary care centres, schools, the major development at Grangegorman in the city centre and a new and long-desired State pathology laboratory and in upgrading the national motorway network with a further &euro;850 million, all helping to create jobs and spread that money through the economy.  I agree that dealing with the national economy is the challenge facing Government because our international reputation has been restored and the international economy is running very strongly with profits, the numbers employed and exports increasing.  The line of investment into the country remains very strong which feeds into many of the small and medium enterprises who specialise in servicing those industries.  </p><p> Our challenge is to deal with the live register, the perception of which the Minister for Social Protection has made radical changes to in addition to its competence and status as a resource for employment.  We will also provide opportunities to access to credit for small and medium enterprises; cut costs, red tape and administration; and prove it can work.  It is in this way that confidence is restored, not to mention the difficulties people have experienced with mortgages.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned universal health insurance.  The future health road map was published and will lead to that.  We have said that universal health insurance would be at the end of the lifetime of this Administration.  The legislation to abolish the Health Service Executive is proceeding through the Oireachtas.  The &quot;money follows the patient&quot; proposals have been published and will enable us to move to a more equitable system of resource allocation so that people get medical care as close to them as possible based on their medical needs.  The special delivery unit piloted by the Minister for Health has made substantial progress.  At the end of 2012, there were 20,000 fewer people waiting on trolleys, which was a reduction of almost 24% on 2011.  The number of adults and children waiting for surgeries was reduced by 95 over the year.  The risk equalisation scheme commenced in 2013.  The new deal, which deals with medicines, and Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill will lead to a reduction of over &euro;400 million over three years.  These are important decisions made as part of restructuring to bring about a more effective and efficient health system.  The Government decided to make the St. James's Hospital campus the location for the national children's hospital.  The budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention increased to &euro;8.1 million in 2013, up by &euro;4 million.  A number of persons were employed to work in that body.  I could go on about different sectors but Deputies may want to ask other questions.</p></speech>

However, the truth is far from that, as well he knows.  When he is asked about the major issues facing ordinary people, particularly unemployment and the crushing effect of austerity, he very often reads out the same list of things the Government is doing for people.  One can only conclude or assume from the way he responds to these things that he believes the people out there do not really understand what a wonderful job he is doing.  I suggest that this is not the case and that the people outside understand very well what is going on and that two years after this Government was elected, it has not delivered the things people expected it to deliver in a national emergency that has not abated one iota.</p><p>  The Taoiseach knows what the key issue is because &quot;Get Ireland working&quot; was emblazoned on every Fine Gael poster in every town and village across the country.  That was the promise he made and everybody knew that this was what needed to be done.  Instead, the Government has slashed 30,000 public sector jobs and imposed crushing austerity that has destroyed thousands of small and medium enterprises and led to tens of thousands of educated and talented young people who want to work leaving this country.  The unemployment figures would be catastrophic were it not for the escape valve of emigration.  Is emigration the Government's jobs policy?  Is it the Government's policy to force people out of the country because that is the only thing making any difference to the job figures?  They would be higher now than they were when the Government came into office were it not for the tens of thousands who have left.  What people want to know is whether the Taoiseach will recognise that he has failed to deliver on the promise to make a significant dent in the catastrophic unemployment figures that are blighting the lives of 430,000 families and crippling our economy.  Is it not the case that unless the Government deals with that crisis in a serious way, we will be in a dreadful state for some time to come?  </p><p>  The Taoiseach is engaged in the classic manipulation of figures and facts when he lists off 5,000 jobs here and 500 or 10 million there but does not give the other side of the equation.  The simple fact is that unemployment was 14% when the Government came into office and it is still 14%.  According to the projections we get from the troika, the Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance, if all the Government's plans work out as well as possible, unemployment will be 13.6% in three years time.  The best we can look forward to with the Government's jobs plan is a reduction of 0.5% or 0.6% in the unemployment rate.  Is that what the Taoiseach is offering people?  If it is, because this is what the Department of Finance and troika forecast, we are looking at well in excess of 400,000 people unemployed even after we exit the troika programme in three years time.  Surely the Taoiseach can offer us something better than that?  </p><p>  Where is the strategic investment bank that was in the programme for Government and was going to deliver 100,000 jobs?  Where is the massive scheme of insulation of public buildings that could save the money the Government is trying to take from low and middle-income workers without attacking their wages?  The Government could put construction workers who are on the dole back at work insulating public buildings and saving energy costs.  Where is that programme?  Where are the tens of thousands of jobs that could be created if he did that?  It has not happened.  </p><p>Has the Taoiseach forced the banks to start lending money into the economy?  He has not.  He puts up his hands and says, "We are not very happy with the banks and what they do" but nothing actually changes.  </p><p> The Taoiseach announced seven new research centres.  However, what he does not say is that the research budget for Science Foundation Ireland is lower this year than it was last year.  The money will now be spread over these seven new centres and the existing ones which has relied on this funding.  Many research centres will have less money next year than they had in previous years.  The Taoiseach is manipulating the facts.  I ask him to say what his plan is to get the 400,000 people unemployed - not a few hundred jobs here or a few training places there - back to work.  What is the timescale?  When can we expect these 400,000 or even 300,000 of them who want to work back at work?</p></speech>

Between 2008 and 2011, 250,000 people lost their jobs in the private sector.  The Deputy chose not to mention that statistic.  He chose not to mention the mess we were left to deal with.  Some 1,000 private sector jobs are now being created per month, for which I am grateful, as it is a sign of confidence returning.  No one on this side of the House has talked about green shoots or corners being turned because there is a long and difficult road ahead.  I refer to the woman down the street who runs a small shop.  She has had five very difficult years.  In her opinion, if she were to walk up O'Connell Street with a placard stating her shop would close unless the people bought her merchandise, she would get very little sympathy.  Some 250,000 jobs went between 2008 and 2011.  That is the reason there is no magic wand to restore the numbers of jobs to which the Deputy refers.  I advise him that what he said about the numbers is incorrect.  Of the 420,000 people to whom he referred, 90,000 work part-time.  The real figure is 330,000 people who, unfortunately, are out of work and on the live register.  The second point is that the monthly movement of numbers on the live register is extensive.  </p><p>  On various occasions the Deputy was in north-west Mayo with some of his people.  I remind him that 200,000 people, mostly men, were employed there over a period of ten years.  This employment transformed the economy.  There are significant numbers of people working on major construction projects in different parts of the country, but the level of employment is nothing like what we want.  Even in the days of national squandermania, there was a cohort who remained unemployed when, technically, the country had reached full employment.  It is also a fact of life that interest rates have come down from over 14% to less than 4%.  The Deputy might not regard this as important for business, but, in fact, it is.  The agreement with the ECB and the projected savings in the next ten years are significant and also an important sign of confidence returning.</p><p>  I recently received the president of a group in Catalonia.  Over 52% of young people are unemployed in Spain.  Many have moved to Germany to work in engineering, but there is frustration and anger among the young unemployed.  We included in the MFF proposals provision for a fund of &euro;6 billion to deal with youth unemployment.  I do not like to see anyone being forced to leave the country.  There is a campaign under way in the United States to look for comprehensive legislation on immigration and pathways to citizenship.  When I was growing up in County Mayo, emigration was a normal part of life, although I do not suggest that should be the case now.  I met Irish people in China and other countries who were in those places by choice.  They want to gain experience and use their skills and talents.  I hope they will return to this country when they have gained that experience.  The people for whom I feel sorry are those who believe they have to leave because they have no hope.  That is why the Government must get the fundamentals right when sorting out the country's financial position, while also creating the opportunity and environment in which to do business.  </p><p>  I refer to a local example which caught my attention a day or two ago.  An unemployed construction worker opened a bakery in the west.  He took a course in Ballymaloe and now has 15 unemployed construction workers working in the bakery.  This enterprise attracted one of the biggest investments - &euro;200,000 - ever made in the history of &quot;Dragons' Den&quot;.  Because of the quality of the product he is producing, he is supplying multinationals and bigger stores in the country.  That has been the result of his initiative.</p><p>  Yesterday I launched four initiatives born out of current research and innovation.  While these initiatives might be small and may not be of interest to the Deputy, people are being employed, men and women who now have an opportunity to go out to work every morning, expand their enterprises and sell abroad.  I visited the offices of Google recently.  I refer to the challenge set by it last year to have 10,000 new sellers on-line within 12 months.  That objective was achieved.  Many people in towns all over the country think that if they set up a website, it will work automatically, but that is not the case.  However, the world is wide open to receive their wares and they need to be able to access that market.</p><p>  There is more than one issue.  We are all interested in hearing ideas on job creation.  That is the reason I was so pleased last year when the Kerry Group which began in Listowel in 1972 set up a world-class innovation centre in Naas worth &euro;100 million which was devoted to food research.  It will become a magnet for blue chip companies from all over the world.  It will employ young people, scientists, researchers, innovators and creators.  These initiatives send important signals about the country.  </p><p>  Nobody on this side of the House will say we have beaten the unemployment problem.  However, of all the Ministers for social welfare, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has shaken up that Department.  She has developed an understanding of the resources, talent and experience available among the 330,000 unemployed, the vast majority of whom want to work and deserve the opportunity to experience the new way of interacting with people in order that working will become a reality.</p><p>  I hope Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett will go down to his local bank manager - or bank managers - to ask him or her or them what he or she has or they have loaned in the last quarter.  New targets have been set for the banks.  The pillar banks have a target of reaching a figure of &euro;4 billion in new lending in this year.  I have talked to Deputies from the different parties, some of whom tell me that they know of half a dozen companies which were unable to access credit, perhaps because their applications were incomplete.  Other Deputies say they have proof of money being available and they can give the names of those who received loans.  It is a case of being very clear with the banks.  That is why we interact with the regulator on a regular basis.</p><p>  Ours is not a programme of austerity; rather, it is one of change and development to sort out the country's problems and deal with the issues we all want to see being resolved - unemployment and job creation.  I would like to think the next stimulus package will be used for the building of schools and primary health care centres and whatever else in order that people around the country will see that things are happening and that we will see contractors building and investing in the future for our children and those who will come behind us.</p><p>That can only happen where the economy is running efficiently to attract investment and deposits and where there is flexibility that gets people off the live register and into the world of work.  The best news a Deputy will get in his or her constituency is not simply the announcement of new jobs, but the reality of men and women having the opportunity to go to work every morning and have fulfilling jobs which allow them to contribute to local economies and to their personal lives and futures.  That is where we want to be but it cannot happen unless the fundamental problems are dealt with.  The Government is doing its damnedest to ensure that those things happen.</p></speech>

Does the Taoiseach agree that the policy of the Government on austerity is fundamental to any answer to those questions?  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has said that while we have reached the limits of austerity, there still appears to be an inexplicable preference for loading the costs of banking crises squarely onto the shoulders of ordinary people and small businesses.  She is a member of the Government, bound by collective responsibility.  Is she stating the view of the Government and is it the Taoiseach's view?  Does not her statement call for an immediate review of the programme for Government, which envisaged at least four years of the austerity which has proved to be a nightmare for ordinary people?  If austerity has reached its limits - and it has - and the Minister for Social Protection is not merely posturing, does it not mean that the further austerity measures in the pipeline should be abandoned forthwith?  Does it not mean there should be no more cuts in social protection?</p><p>  The property tax represents the equivalent of a week's income for low-paid workers and much more than that for many people on social welfare.  The power to rob people's wages and bank accounts has been given to the Revenue Commissioners.  Does not the Minister for Social Protection's statement imply that the policy should be abolished?  It means the cut of &euro;300 million this year which will affect low-income, middle-income and frontline workers in the public service should be abolished.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be highly cynical if a member of the Government made such a statement and was afforded acres of print in the capitalist media if it was mere posturing and a vain attempt to rescue credibility for a rapidly sinking Labour Party?  Does he agree that if there is any credibility to the statement, it signals a change of Government policy?  What changes will the Taoiseach announce today in view of the statement by a member of his Government?</p><p>  This is the first time I have seen the Minister for Social Protection in the House during questions to the Taoiseach, which leads me to question whether she is practising to be T&aacute;naiste or if the Taoiseach ordered her to attend for his announcement of a major change in policy in line with her suggestion to end austerity.</p></speech>

I hope the Taoiseach will reply candidly and not go all around the houses.  I spent ten years questioning the Taoiseach's predecessor, Bertie Ahern, when he rambled on and on.  The Taoiseach is better than the former Taoiseach in that regard.  I want him to answer candidly the key question on austerity and the three particular examples of it.  We on the Opposition side would welcome the Taoiseach sharing his time with the Minister for Social Protection to allow us to speak directly with her on the matter.</p></speech>

That is the context in which the Minister for Social Protection was speaking.  I do not accept that Government set out with anything other than a programme to rectify our problems and restore our country's credibility and integrity.  I have said on many occasions that the international economy is moving very much in the right direction as far as Ireland is concerned.  The difficulties other countries in Europe face represent a challenge for us also.  Our productivity levels are extraordinary and export levels have been higher than ever.  The better the shape other countries in Europe are in, the better it is for our producers and exporters.</p><p>  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the challenge is to deal with our national confidence and economy.  That is why the structural changes have been taking place, principally within the Department of Social Protection through the establishment of the new system of Intreo offices.  While they will not in themselves change the situation, their establishment is a recognition of the resources and talent which exist.</p></speech>

He does not want to pay for water or services to properties and wants to increase taxes on some mythical figure as if there were a small number of wealthy people who could sort out this country's ills.  It is absolute nonsense.  I remember joining Mayo County Council as a young fellow back in the 1970s when people paid for water and refuse collection.  They paid their rates and local authorities supplied their services as best they could.  Even Deputy Boyd Barrett when he removes himself from the Chamber knows full well that there is nothing for nothing in the world and that people make a contribution.  As far as the Government is concerned, those who have and earn most will pay most.</p></speech>

There is a requirement as espoused by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whom I support fully, for savings of &euro;300 million.

It will never happen overnight and, as I pointed out to Deputy Boyd Barrett when he spoke about 420,000 people on the live register, 90,000 people of those are working part-time.</p></speech>

Two thirds of the consolidation of the public finances occurred before this Government came to power.  The Taoiseach was then the leader of the Fine Gael Party and opposed every single measure.  He attacked our cuts to consolidate the public finances.  Along with the Labour Party, he opposed every measure and gave the impression things could be done differently.  The public is disillusioned because so many promises were made prior to the election and breached.  Examples include child benefit, respite care, and third level grants, where the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, signed a solemn pledge to the students of Ireland on the steps of Trinity College to reduce the &euro;500 increase and swear there would be no increase for the duration of the Government.  The Labour Party said it would do that and that child benefit would not be cut.  In respect of the disability aspects of the programme for Government, the breach of promise and commitment was stark from the beginning.  The Taoiseach's reply was that there was no need to change the programme for Government.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, does not agree and has clear views on the need to change the programme for Government.  Matters within the Labour Party may be responsible for that.  At the very least, the programme for Government should be corrected because it contains things that will not happen.  Budget decisions have gone against much of what is in the programme for Government in respect of disability and home helps.  Comparing the home helps section in the programme for Government with what has happened shows they are opposites.  It should be more accurate and more reflective of what is happening through Government decisions.</p><p>  There is no progress on universal health insurance.  The health insurance industry is almost in a death spiral, with thousands leaving the insurance industry.  Reserves, particularly in the VHI, are in difficulty and need capital injection.  There will be further significant cuts in health services.  There is a sense that the centre cannot hold in the health services and no massaging of the figures will change it.</p><p>  The Taoiseach referred to a figure of 250,000.  We have had a major banking crisis, which is not unique to Ireland.  It does not suit the Taoiseach's narrative to say that.  He can talk about the best year since 2006.  I was the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2006 and it was a very good year for the IDA.  That is not the whole story in terms of employment.  The Taoiseach referred to research.  Science Foundation Ireland was initiated over a decade ago and has proved very successful.  Before that, I initiated the PRTLI programme.  Combined, they transformed the research landscape in the country.  That is helping in terms of the innovation and research to which the Taoiseach referred.  It is in not within the frame of the Taoiseach to acknowledge these fundamental transformations occurred in research or in terms of the financial services centre in Dublin and its 30,000 jobs that are still there.</p><p>  With regard to disability, does the Taoiseach agree to be faithful to what is in the programme for Government and home helps or else correct it?  The programme for Government talks about the abolition of the Seanad as a clear commitment, along with an appeals court and a referendum on the patents treaty.  This would mean three referendums in the autumn.  This has not been presented to the House.  With the budget to be announced in October, and a full legislative calendar, how will the referendums be handled?  What is the timeline in terms of the Bills that must be produced and when will the information pertaining to the referendums be produced?  Can the Taoiseach give an assurance on the time to debate the matters or will he rush these constitutional changes through the House?</p><p>  Some months ago, the Taoiseach indicated to the House that he would give us early sight of the proposals.  That was in February 2011, and he said he had the details of the Seanad abolition worked out at that stage.  Recently, the Taoiseach told me he had many papers on it and I asked him to publish the papers so that we can have an informed debate on the issue.  The Taoiseach winked across the floor at me and said that he could not be doing that.  As we are getting closer to the summer, I would have thought the Taoiseach would be in a position to polish the proposals on the abolition of the Seanad and the other items of legislation.</p><p>  I recall the Taoiseach promising that he would keep report cards on Ministers.</p></speech>

On more than one occasion, I heard Deputy Martin say during those tumultuous times that there was no need for a bailout in Ireland.  His colleagues at the time had never heard of the fact that the IMF was on the doorstep.  They nodded knowingly to each other that they had not heard it.</p></speech>

There is more than enough work for everybody to carry through in the lifetime of this Government.  The future health roadmap for universal health insurance was published.  Legislation to abolish the HSE is going through the Oireachtas.  The money follows the patient proposals have been published.  The special delivery unit has made an impact.  A new risk equalisation scheme commenced in 2013.  The new deal reducing the cost of medicines by &euro;400 million over three years is in place.  There is a new agreement with hospital consultants to enhance health services.  The new national carer's strategy, which had been left lying around for years untouched by the previous Administration, was published.  There has been a strengthening of the community mental health teams.  Some 220 posts in the adult mental health service have been or are being filled and 109 posts in the child and adolescent mental health service have been filled this year and more are expected to be filled.  The unit for people with cystic fibrosis at St. Vincent's Hospital was opened in 2012, although admittedly it was begun before that.  St. James's Hospital was selected as the site for the national children's hospital.  As I said earlier, there has been a doubling of the allocation to suicide awareness, intervention and prevention.  </p><p>  Work on the Seanad is nearing completion.  There will be a number of referenda in the autumn.  The Government has not yet decided on the date.  </p></speech>

He indicated that the legislation would be introduced in the House this week.  I understand he said earlier that it is now under active consideration.</p><p>  The Taoiseach might indicate whether a Government Minister spoke to <i>The Sunday Times</i> on the Bill and gave the information on the Spanish inquisition-type approach to a suicidal woman requesting a termination.  How did the detail of the legislation get to <i>The Sunday Times</i>?  That kind of leaking is making a complex and sensitive situation worse and is not helpful to the entire process.  For the past 48 hours, people have been talking about nothing else but the information contained in <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, did not deny it as such.  If one reads his statement carefully, it is a nuanced explanation of what would not happen as opposed to what is in the legislation.  Are the heads of the Bill ready to be published?

The situation continues to worsen, against a background where there are more empty housing units in the State than ever before.  I have asked the Taoiseach repeatedly in this Chamber, during Leaders' Questions, Taoiseach's questions and the Order of Business, when this House will get to discuss the housing Bill, which was on the legislative programme for last year and which is on it again this year.

It was to effect change regarding the 100% priority given to pensioners, allowing for a better return to existing and former employees who have not yet retired.  I have been contacted by a number of people who face the winding up of their pension funds on 2 May after having made contributions to the funds for over 20 years.  They face circumstances in which only 20% of their funds will be left.  Legislation was promised to balance this out, especially given what happened with Waterford Glass.  What is the current position on the legislation?  Unfortunately, it will not come through quickly enough for the people who are to see their defined benefit pension schemes wound up on 2 May.</p></speech>

It will probably be the second or third week in July, depending on how business goes.  I do not want to confirm that because it is a sensitive Bill that requires proper analysis to give everybody the opportunity to have his or her say on it.  It is so important.

Resolution No. 2 relates to agreement of the report on directors' remuneration as outlined in the annual report 2012.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Government has a 15% shareholding in Bank of Ireland.  The current CEO at the Bank of Ireland receives a basic salary of &euro;690,000, which is well above the Government cap of over &euro;500,000.  He also receives other payments, including pension contributions, bringing his package to more than &euro;800,000 per annum.  This CEO is one of the architects of the lending bubble at Bank of Ireland.  </p><p>  The Minister for Finance has indicated his intention to abstain on the aforementioned resolution.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, that abstention is not policy and in this case is not good policy.  We need to send a clear message that these outrageous salaries by a bank bailed out by this State and its taxpayers are not acceptable.  I urge the Minister to abandon the policy of abstention and vote &quot;No&quot; in this instance.  </p><p>  I am concerned that the Bank of Ireland has lapsed into its old ways.  These excessive payments to its executives are over the top.  It has also been revealed that the bank is using market research to trick people into giving up their tracker mortgages so as to improve its bottom line and pay super salaries to its top executives.  I ask that the Minister exercise the State's shareholding to ensure this does not happen and to raise this issue at the annual general court tomorrow.</p></speech>

I also believe the Government has been too soft on the banks for too long.  It is now time for the Minister for Finance to take a stand on behalf of the public when dealing with them.</p><p>  The banks are hounding mortgage holders, refusing to give credit to small businesses and, in paying these enormous salaries, laughing in the faces of Irish people.  It is not that a cap of &euro;500,000 is too low.  What the banks are doing is brass neck greed.  We all know that the banks played an enormous part in driving this country off the cliff.  We owe them nothing.  I call on the Minister for Finance to use the Government's 15% shareholding in Bank of Ireland on behalf of the Irish nation.  </p><p>  What bothers me most about the appalling behaviour of so many banks is the undermining effect it has had on people's confidence in our institutions which, in turn, affects our economy.  For this reason alone, people would cheer at this issue being tackled.</p></speech>

I look to the Minister to ensure that the voices of the Irish people are heard at tomorrow's Bank of Ireland AGM.  I have been contacted by constituents in Bray and elsewhere in Wicklow who are struggling to make mortgage repayments.  While I accept and welcome the Government is doing what it can to assist those in arrears, it must also ensure the banks play ball.</p><p>  I was surprised to learn that the Bank of Ireland conducted market research on tracker mortgages with a view to moving customers off them thereby strengthening its financial position.  I would like the Minister to address this important matter at the Bank of Ireland's AGM tomorrow.  I am not pleased that customers are being intentionally misled.  I am concerned that Bank of Ireland is not alone in attempting this underhanded tactic.</p><p> I would also like the Minister to explain what social dividend is to be achieved, in terms of buildings or otherwise, from the support shown by the taxpayer to Bank of Ireland.  To take the example of Bank of Ireland on College Green, why has the State not repossessed that building?  Why has a request not gone in, at least, from the Minister's representatives that Bank of Ireland vacate those premises?  The building it occupies is of significant historical value as the world's first purpose-built two-chamber parliament.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to address these important matters, with urgency, at the AGM tomorrow.</p></speech>

Tomorrow morning will see the annual general court of Bank of Ireland take place, with the nation represented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The nation holds 15% of the bank's shares and, as such, is one of the biggest shareholders in the bank.  Many items will come up at this AGM, one of the most important of which will be the remuneration of its directors.</p><p>  It emerged recently that the chief executive of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richie Boucher, was in receipt of more than &euro;840,000 per annum, including salary and pension contributions, despite the cap on such salaries of &euro;500,000.  This would seem to be blatant disregard for the current economic situation in the country and further highlights the high-handed attitude to the Irish people who are struggling to make ends meet.  How can it be argued that Mr. Boucher should receive such remuneration when the ordinary men and women on the street cannot get an overdraft, an extension to a loan or a mortgage?  The bank's doors are closed to the people who need it most but it seems that is not so for its directors.  Our small and medium enterprises are starved of cash and our farmers are resorting to Teagasc and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to bail them out with funding for fodder for starving animals, only because the banks will not play ball.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Noonan, if he is going to play ball with Bank of Ireland.  </p><p>  The feeling on the street is that the big companies and the banks, as well as the big men and women, are still coining it while the ordinary man and woman are struggling very hard against all that this economic situation is throwing at them.  The word on the street is that little or nothing has changed.  It is time we put things right and the Minister has an opportunity to do that tomorrow morning.  I urge him to strike a blow for the people of Ireland, the people whom we represent, and say &quot;No&quot; to huge salaries for bankers.  I urge him to restore to the Irish people some faith that we will do right by them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1048" speakername="Arthur Spring" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300030#CC00300"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this topic.</p><p>  This is the second time I have raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  In light of the fact that Mr. Boucher, when appearing before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 1 November 2012, showed what was nothing shy of a contemptuous attitude towards this House and our position as public representatives, it is fitting that we have representation at the Bank of Ireland meeting tomorrow.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the banking licence application under the Central Bank Act 1971 defines responsibility for proper management and control of the credit institutions and the integrity of their systems as resting solely with their board of directors.  Mr. Boucher joined Bank of Ireland in 2003 and became a director in 2006.  He has been remunerated for his time as an employee, but surely to God we can question whether his appointment as a director benefited the shareholders and the State or was in breach of the Central Bank Act 1971.  I am of the opinion that Mr. Boucher should be subjected to a shot across the bow.  Every member of the public I have met would like to be at that AGM tomorrow.  Many of them have never dabbled in shares and are not shareholders, yet they have felt the full brunt of the inability of the directors to govern the bank in a prudent manner that does not go against the interests of the nation.  The people of Ireland would like to see a cap on remuneration and I think Mr. Boucher should be put in his place.  He is one of the few remaining directors in the banks, of whom 55 have been removed since 2007.  However, his position is something the people of Ireland believe is not worthy of the remuneration currently on offer.  It also shows that there is a hangover in the bank from the old banking systems.  The people of Ireland want to see a 15% execution.  They want to say &quot;No.  Enough is enough.&quot;  Let us get back to what is morally and financially correct.</p></speech>

In that regard, it might be helpful and useful if I outline the operational relationship that exists with the bank and the general policy on remuneration at the covered institutions before dealing with some of the more specific points that have been raised by colleagues.</p><p>  The relationship framework provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions.  These frameworks, which are bank-specific, are published on the website of the Department of Finance, having been agreed with our international partners, the troika.  They recognise that the covered institutions remain separate economic units with independent powers of decision and that the boards and management teams retain the responsibility and authority to determine their institutions' strategies and commercial policies and conduct their day-to-day operations.</p><p>  The current policy on remuneration at the covered institutions dictates that no individual may receive annual aggregate remuneration, excluding pension contributions, exceeding &euro;500,000 unless specifically authorised.  This overarching policy is now supplemented by the inescapable conclusion, arising out of the recently published review of remuneration practices and frameworks at the covered institutions conducted by Mercer, that as the remaining institutions still incur losses, their respective cost bases need to be reduced further.  This is essential if they are to return to profitability and be in a position to support the economy and repay the State's investment through a return to private ownership.</p><p>  On behalf of the Government, the Minister for Finance has directed the banks to come up with plans for how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State's objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of somewhere between 6% and 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.</p><p>  The Minister has not directed the specific measures that each bank should take, respecting their differing paths to profitability and the relationship with the State as explained above.  I expect to receive an outline of each bank's strategy by the end of April.  However, I expect that any measures proposed will require sacrifices at all employee levels and strong leadership to be exercised by the banks in delivering in a timely manner.  The stakes for all are high.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector of the economy.  However, it can never be forgotten by the management and employees of these banks, both past and present, that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived.  This needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.  It was in this context that the Minister decided to abstain on the resolution to consider the report on directors' remuneration.  In regard to the other resolutions, I can confirm that the Minister has voted in favour of each of them, one of which relates to the election and re-election of the bank's directors.</p><p>  In regard to some of the more specific points raised by the Deputies, I can confirm that the bank is in compliance with the existing policy on remuneration.  As I mentioned, the current policy and previous iterations of it allowed for exemptions.  It was under this parameter that the previous Government authorised a salary for the present CEO of the bank in excess of the then salary cap of &euro;500,000.  I am reluctant to discuss the remuneration details of an individual on the floor of the House.  However, such details are well known, having been published in annual reports of the bank over the last number of years.</p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that this was the position the Minister for Finance faced on this particular issue.</p><p>The strong legal advice available to this and previous Governments is that pre-existing contractual commitments have to be honoured.  In the case of the new CEO appointments at AIB and Permanent TSB, respectively, the Minister ensured the policy on remuneration was observed and it continues to be held.</p></speech>

Reducing the cost base by 6% to 10% normally affects ordinary working people in the banking sector.  I ask the Minister of State to raise tomorrow the issue of senior executives on outrageous salaries, not ordinary everyday workers.  I have grave concerns about some of the directors being re-elected to the board of the bank.</p><p>  As a shareholder, I ask the Minister to watch how the banks are returning to their old ways.  A tracker mortgage of &euro;250,000 over the period could be worth up to &euro;100,000 to the mortgage holder.  The findings of market research will be used to inform and develop attractive products to encourage tracker mortgage holders to move off the product and ultimately improve the overall profitability of Bank of Ireland's mortgage book.  That will be to the detriment of ordinary tracker mortgage holders.  We need to exercise our 15% stakeholding and I ask the Minister of State to do so.</p></speech>

The CEO is on the equivalent of nine Deputies' salaries.  I appreciate that we only have 15% of the vote in the bank, but it would send a very important message to the people if we were to use it against such a high salary.  We are in the position of having to ask public servants to take another pay cut.  It would put us in a stronger moral position when requesting them to do so and obviously we will take a pay cut also.</p></speech>

They should not be kept in a position where they are compensated in a way that is far in excess of what anybody else in society is being paid.  As a former employee of banking institutions, including Bank of Ireland, I can tell the Minister of State that many of my former colleagues are looking at the CEO of Bank of Ireland and Mr. Kane who lost bonuses in the United Kingdom because of the way he had conducted himself and is now in a position of authority in Bank of Ireland as a director.  These former colleagues and people working at the front desks of the banks face losing their jobs and are concerned, as they have massive debts.  They look at Mr. Boucher and his ilk and say he is not aware of what is morally and financially correct.  I urge the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to tomorrow morning use the 15% shareholding on behalf of the people.  We are public representatives and the public does not want to see bankers walking out with golden sunset cheques in their back pockets.</p></speech>

The firm intent of the Government is to make sure the new banking model that will be operated in this country will be sustainable and responsive to the needs of the economy.  That is clear.  The taxpayer has put enormous funds into the banks and it is crucially important that they are the engines of growth in the economy.  That requires significant cultural change in the model which virtually collapsed the country.</p><p>  It would be wrong of anyone to describe this as the Minister's position.  It is the Government's position, as is well known and clear, following the publication of the Mercer report.  We expect to receive from the covered institutions by the end of April very clear plans for how they will reduce their cost base by somewhere between 6% and 10%.  It will be a matter for the banks to bring forward these plans in a circumstance where significant de-leveraging has already occurred within the banking system following the announcement we made in March 2011 on entering government.</p><p>  It is appropriate that the greater reductions in salary would be at the top rather than the bottom, but we will wait and see what the banks will produce by the end of April.  Government policy, endorsed by all members of the Government, is that each of the institutions must produce a plan by the end of April.  The key task that we face is to return the banking system to profitability.  We are determined to do this to ensure we get our money back as taxpayers.</p><p>  While I understand the deep frustration of colleagues an know this to be the majority view in the country, we have also negotiated as part of our EU Presidency the CRD IV directive which is vitally important because it places significant limits on the entire bankers' bonus and pay culture that was at the rotten heart of the European banking system for the past decade or so.  That is a significant achievement of the Government and our Presidency.  The banks will operate under the directive when they return to profitability.</p></speech>

We can all agree that one of the potential solutions for many borrowers is the split mortgage model.  At the end of 2012 there were only 52 such split mortgages, but the evidence of the past couple of months is that the banks are beginning to offer split mortgages to varying degrees.  We know, for example, that AIB has offered 1,400 split mortgages to its distressed borrowers in the first quarter of the current year and other banks are apparently doing the same.</p><p>  The key issue I want to raise is the lack of consistency in the way in which the split mortgage model is being implemented.  I refer, in particular, to the manner in which the warehoused element of the mortgage is being treated, especially the interest rate being applied to that portion of the mortgage.  AIB does not charge any interest on the warehoused portion.  While I do not intend this to be a Bank of Ireland bashing day, Bank of Ireland is charging full interest on the warehoused portion.  As I understand it, Permanent TSB is charging 1% on the warehoused portion. </p><p>  This makes an enormous difference to borrowers.  If it is calculated that a distressed borrower with a mortgage of &euro;200,000 can repay half of that mortgage, the other half is warehoused.</p><p>As part of the Bank of Ireland solution, that &euro;100,000 will accrue interest over ten years at a rate of 4.5%, which will come to &euro;57,000.  The same customer with AIB would have no interest added to the warehoused portion, while in the case of Permanent TSB, at a rate of 1%, the figure would come to &euro;10,500.  The difference is dramatic.  The point is that split mortgages are sponsored by the Government and the Central Bank, but, again, there is a distinct lack of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which they are being rolled out.  If one looks at the other solutions proposed, we all know the terms &ldquo;interest only&rdquo;, &ldquo;arrears capitalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;term extension&rdquo; mean the same thing across the board.  It is not acceptable that, in essence, the split mortgage solution is being denied to many people through the terms and conditions attached to it.  Will the Minister give a commitment to, at a minimum, raise this issue with the Central Bank and ask if it is satisfied with the manner in which the split mortgages are being rolled out?  Will it ensure there is consistency and uniformity, particularly on the key issue of the interest rate applied to the warehoused portion of the mortgage?</p></speech>

He will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s announcement on 13 March which coincided with the Central Bank&rsquo;s announcement of additional measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks.  The objective is that 50% of distressed borrowers will have received potential solutions from the banks by the end of the year.</p><p>  As the Deputy&rsquo;s main point was about split mortgages, I will jump to that issue.  I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that the majority of lenders have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a split mortgage arrangement.  A split mortgage warehouses a part of what remains unamortised from the initial capital sum in what can be called part B of the loan.  Part B is not serviced unless the borrower's financial position improves significantly in the future, in which case the split will be revised in line with the new circumstances with the provision that, to preserve incentives, only a fraction of the new resources will be applied to the loan.  Also, the maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lender's own internal criteria.  The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower's and the lender's perspective.  All of the products offered by the banks have been prepared in the context of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears resolution strategy.</p><p>  The banks, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.  Decisions on the handling of their individual mortgages and other loans, including distressed loans, are solely a matter for the board and management of individual institutions in the exercise of their commercial and fiduciary responsibilities.  In respect of the covered institutions, under the relationship framework agreements the Minister for Finance has with the covered banks, responsibility for commercial policy and day-to-day operations remains with the boards and management of the banks.  The Minister for Finance does not have any involvement in such decisions.  He has no role to play in the decisions the covered banks make on the treatment of individual loans.</p><p>  We do, however, engage on the macro-policy response.  The Minister for Finance recently met board representatives from the three covered institutions to receive an update on the progress each institution was making in dealing with their distressed mortgage holders.  The Department of Finance is also meeting the main mortgage lenders regularly to assess their progress in addressing the banks' mortgage arrears strategies and meeting the targets set by the Central Bank in offering sustainable, long-term mortgage solutions to borrowers in difficulty.  This is part of the regular ongoing engagement the Department has with the institutions as part of the overall policy response.</p><p>  In summary, the Government is making significant progress to address the problem of mortgage arrears and believes the ingredients of a transparent resolution process for borrowers are now in place.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath has made a sensible point on how the banks deal with split mortgages.  Now that we have targets in respect of these solutions, it is important there be uniformity in the way these products are rolled out.  I will raise the matter with the Central Bank to see what engagement it can have with the covered institutions.  It is in all our interests, particularly those with distressed mortgages, that we make progress in this area.  Issues could arise if one were to create a dichotomy in the products available owing to which bank one was dealing with.  It is a fair point.</p></speech>

Split mortgages are a really good solution for many people with distressed mortgages.  However, if one is going to hammer one group of customers with a full interest rate while others get a good deal through interest-free warehousing, we are not going to achieve the consistency and fairness we want in bringing about a resolution of the mortgage arrears crisis.  I have outlined the stark difference if one warehouses a figure of &euro;100,000 for ten years between Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB at &euro;57,000, 0% interest and &euro;10,500, respectively.</p><p>  In the case of the Minister&rsquo;s script, it was more of the same about not getting involved in the detail.  That is what has been wrong up to now.  If we leave these issues to the banks&rsquo; own devices, they will not solve the problem.  It is welcome that some of them are rolling out split mortgages, with AIB claiming it will reach a figure of 1,400 by the end of the first quarter.  I hope a good share of customers take up this offer because it is a good one.  It is welcome that the Minister will raise this specific issue with the Central Bank and I hope he will come back to me on it.</p></speech>

It is in the banks&rsquo; interests to make progress on it.  If they are bringing forward solutions that will offer no support to people, we are not going to hit the ambitious and exacting targets we have set in terms of mortgage resolution.  As we are so heavily involved in the banks, there is a responsibility on us to make rapid progress on the issue.  Already in the first quarter between 3,000 and 4,000 split mortgages have been raised across the institutions, which is good progress.  If we see that number rolled out in each quarter of the year, it will make a significant difference to the 100,000 families who are in an appalling situation and whom we are all interested in assisting.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she has been unavoidably detained and relays her apologies for not being able to attend the Chamber.</p><p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this pertinent and relevant issue, particularly when the matter of the unbelievable weather-related conditions many farmers have faced has been raised today and last week.  While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, it is regrettable that the Minister for Social Protection could not attend to reply to this Topical Issue matter which cuts to the hearts of many rural families.</p><p>It is predominantly an issue that affects people in small holdings on bad land across many counties, including my county where farmers with dry stock in small holdings were unable to save hay or silage last year.  This year they are at the stage where they cannot get it, and many of them cannot get the supports that were available for farm assist.  As the Minister of State is aware, to qualify for farm assist a farmer has to be on the lowest rung of the ladder in terms of income.  I raise that because the income levels of many of the people who would qualify for farm assist have been affected dramatically, even in recent weeks.  Given the county he is from the Minister will appreciate that input costs, particularly for beef and dairy farmers, have gone through the roof in recent weeks.  There is no access to fodder on the island.  We know it must be imported.  I do not like using the term but this is a critical situation for many people.</p><p> I have just left my office where I spoke to a farmer who not only has to contend with the fact that his income is down but he had the veterinarian from the Department out to his farm today.  He has lost four animals in recent weeks and the veterinarian has put that down to dietary-related illnesses.  Dietary-related illnesses means the cattle are not getting the nutrients they require to keep them alive.  In addition to that he has the cost of disposing of the carcases of the cattle that died on the farm.  He then must account for that to the Department.</p><p> This is not a political issue.  It is an issue affecting farming families up and down the country.  I implore the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come together on this issue and try to come up with a scheme of humanitarian assistance.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, together with his colleague, the Minister for overseas development aid, committed &euro;21 million over three years for developing countries through the World Food Programme.  A humanitarian issue is quickly developing on this island which is threatening animal husbandry and animal welfare, and I do not say that lightly.  If farmers cannot feed their cattle, sheep or any of the animals on their farm and they are left with no alternative other than to watch them, as we have seen in some instances up and down the country, starving in sheds, somebody must intervene to protect those animals and to protect the farmers because their psychological health is suffering.  </p><p> I heard the president of the Irish Farmers Association speak on a radio programme today and he was very responsible in terms of what that organisation is doing.  I had a good deal of engagement with the farming organisations over the weekend, as I am sure did other Deputies, but this is a major issue and if it is not addressed in a coherent way in the coming days between the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, particularly for those on the lowest rung of the income ladder, namely, those on farm assist, we will be facing a major issue.  I appeal to the Government to intervene in this issue on humanitarian grounds for farmers who have nothing more to give.</p></speech>

It is an appropriate time for it.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Social Protection who is otherwise engaged and for whom I am deputising.</p><p>  The farm assist scheme referred to by the Deputy is based on jobseeker's allowance.  It was introduced in 1999 to replace smallholder's unemployment assistance for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  Budget changes over the past two years have brought the more beneficial treatment of farm assist claimants relevant to the treatment of other self-employed persons who would be claiming jobseeker's allowance to an end.  This ensures greater consistency in the treatment of all self-employed persons in both farm assist and jobseeker's allowance.</p><p>  The 2013 budget changes increased the amount of means from self-employment which is assessed against the claim from 85% to 100% and discontinues means testing disregards for child dependants of claimants.</p><p>  The headline rates for farm assist are being maintained, therefore, farm families with the lowest income will be least affected by these changes.  Farm assist remains a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cashflow issues due, for example, to bad weather can ask his local welfare office to review the level of means applying to his claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and considers gross income from farming, less any expenses necessarily incurred.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current position.</p><p>  It may be noted that the farm assist means test continues to offer distinct advantages to farmers.  For example, payments received under the agri-environment options scheme or special areas of conservation schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income, the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded and 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded, with the balance being assessed as means.</p><p>  In addition, farm assist participants can participate in the rural social scheme.  This scheme provides additional resources to maintain and improve local amenities and facilities in rural communities.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fisherpersons, while participants experience opportunities to improve existing skills or develop new skills, and perform valuable work in the community.</p><p>  Any proposals to change the existing structure of the scheme would be for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></speech>

The Minister is right that income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator.  The problem is that the allocations being made are on the income achieved in 2012 but anybody farming in 2012 was feeding cattle with silage or hay cultivated in 2011 when we had a good summer.  My county has had 19 months of almost continuous rain.  A farmer told me at the weekend that he should not be entitled to an acreage payment but a litreage payment because there is so much water on the ground.</p><p>  I am aware the Government has &euro;108 million available for farm assist and that the saving this year was projected to be &euro;3.75 million, which is approximately 3%.  That can be achieved, but it must be pushed down the road, so to speak.</p><p>  I note from the Minister's reply that there is flexibility regarding this issue.  I ask, through the Minister of State's office, that the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would introduce some flexibility in terms of that &euro;108 million within the next 24 to 48 hours to ensure that either farm assist can be advanced to people who actively need it or that something is done with the single farm payment.  </p><p>  This is not an issue for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Social Protection.  It is a humanitarian issue.  If this country can afford to give &euro;21 million to the World Food Programme over three years for developing countries, it behoves us to try to do something for our own farmers whose animals are starving in their farmyards.  That is not an exaggeration.  If anybody in the Department wants me to give them the details of farmers who currently cannot feed their farmers, I will gladly do that but I appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence to get the Ministers for Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come up with some scheme, be it an advance on farm assist, an advance on the single farm payment or a restructuring on the saving for farm assist that can be made within the remainder of the calendar year for 2013.</p></speech>

It has been horrific these past couple of weeks and driving from our constituencies to the capital we wonder whether the spring will come at all.  Thankfully, the first visible signs of spring are here today.  Hopefully, this issue will be addressed by the improvement in the weather.  Farmers who find themselves in this situation can approach their local welfare officers to see whether any further assistance can be given.  That said, I will convey the points made by the Deputy to the Minister.</p></speech>

The Minister will be particularly aware of the proposal, supported by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to allow a &euro;60 million project to proceed in Galway Bay.  While there is support for the project, particularly from the local processing sector, the project has also led to considerable opposition from some quarters, including those engaged in traditional fishing, who are concerned about the impact which the farmed fish will have on wild stocks.  I also understand that Inland Fisheries has expressed its reservations.</p><p>  Before a decision is made by the Minister I hope that we have a much wider debate on the proposal, one that involves all of the relevant bodies, groups and businesses which will be impacted if the farm goes ahead as currently proposed.  The debate should include not only the relevant State authorities, but also the presentation of evidence from people concerned at the possible impact on wild stocks, a concern they say is based on research pertaining to similar fish farms in other countries.  It is vital that such evidence is considered, as any depletion or contamination of wild stocks would have a detrimental impact on already existing fishing enterprises and on tourism and domestic and overseas anglers.</p><p>  I am not opposed to fish farms and there are many instances where they have had a positive impact on local communities and have brought jobs.  However, I have concerns over large projects and the impact they might have.  I also understand there has been a suggestion that the project could be based onshore rather than in the bay and I wonder if any consideration has been given to that.  I hope the Minister takes all of the concerns on board and that there is a fuller debate.  What is required is a debate between the industry, the traditional fishermen and the scientists on the experience in other countries, such as Norway, Chile and Scotland, because this is a very contentious issue, particularly in Galway Bay.</p></speech>

All applications for marine-based aquaculture licences are considered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in accordance with national and EU legislative provisions, which include: Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997; Foreshore Act 1933; the EU Habitats Directive of 92/43/EEC; the EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC; and the Consolidated Environmental Impact Assessment Directives 2011/92/EU.  The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.  All submissions received on foot of the consultation process are given the fullest consideration by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  The EU birds and habitats directives are an important consideration for the licensing process.  In 2007, the European Court of Justice issued a negative judgment against Ireland for breaches of the EU birds and habitats directives.  At that point, the systems and data were not in place to enable consents for aquaculture in compliance with the relevant directives.  As most aquaculture activity takes place in areas designated as special areas of conservation and-or special protection areas for birds, known as Natura 2000 sites, it is necessary to gather a substantial amount of scientific data in the bays.  This data must be obtained in respect of the benthos and the birdlife of the bay under examination.</p><p>  Once the data collection is complete, habitats maps are produced and conservation objectives are set by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is then necessary to undertake an &quot;appropriate assessment&quot; of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas, in the context of the conservation objectives, before any new licence can be issued or any existing licence can be renewed.  This process represents a major investment by the State to ensure the continued sustainable development of the aquaculture industry while maintaining the maximum protection for our coastal environment in accordance with the requirements of national and European legislation.  An additional factor is that all fin fish aquaculture licence applications must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.  Because of issues associated with Natura 2000 areas, a substantial backlog has built up in the processing of applications for new licences and renewal of existing licences.</p><p>  A crucial factor in addressing the backlog is the availability of appropriate assessments for sites located in Natura 2000 areas.  The first stages of the work plan agreed with the EU Commission has focused, by necessity, on the collection of necessary benthic, ornithological and other data relevant to Natura sites.  This data is required for the development of conservation objectives in those sites.  This setting of conservation objectives allows the sites to be appropriately assessed.  In summary, the availability of appropriate assessments will enable the progressive roll out of licensing determinations in line with Natura obligations providing all other licensing requirements have been met.</p><p>  The steps in the process are as follows: -----</p></speech>

I represent the concerns of traditional fishermen, islanders in the Aran islands, inshore fishermen and anglers and other concerned groups in regard to the proposed project off the Aran Islands.  This project is raising huge concern and there is a serious worry that it could contaminate the wild salmon.  Like me, the Minister of State is well aware of the tremendous industry the wild salmon used to be for our coastal communities.  That industry is in recovery, but there is concern that if there is any contamination, through sea lice or whatever, that would cause a further depletion of our wild salmon stocks and would be detrimental.</p><p>  I fully appreciate there is huge emphasis on trying to create jobs, but it should not be jobs at any cost.  If this project is to go ahead, it should be done following a full debate between the people involved, the traditional fishermen, the companies involved, like Bord Iascaigh Mhara which is behind the project, and all concerned stakeholders, including Inland Fisheries Ireland, anglers and scientists.  We need an open, full debate so that people can be satisfied that if we are taking this step, we are doing so with the right information.</p></speech>

This is a landmark project.  It is the result of many years of detailed and comprehensive work by officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Company Law Review Group and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is the largest substantive Bill in the history of the State, spread out over 25 Parts and 17 Schedules and comprising 1,429 sections.  It was recognised at an early stage of the process that a mere consolidation of the existing Companies Acts would be too limiting in light of the reforms that are necessary to sustain Irish competitiveness with respect to company law.  Instead, an overhaul and restructuring of the company law framework was embarked upon.  The result is a Bill that consolidates, simplifies and reforms company law to provide a state-of-the-art framework for all businesses operating in Ireland, whether domestic or foreign.</p><p>  The principal objective of the Bill is to restructure, consolidate, simplify and modernise company law in Ireland, and in doing so to improve Ireland's competitive position as a location for business investment.  This reform seeks to strike a balance between simplifying the day-to-day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies, such as creditors and investors and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime to ensure compliance.  Any modernisation and reform of company law must be viewed against the backdrop of the fact that limited liability itself is a concession by the State to business, and must therefore be tempered by robust regulation to protect creditors' interests and to ensure this concession is not abused.</p><p>  The simplification of company law proposed in this legislation is consistent with the principle of maintaining high standards of shareholder and creditor protection and robust corporate governance.  It is intended that by making company law more accessible, coherent and reflective of business practice, Ireland's international competitiveness will improve and ordinary businesses and companies throughout the country will find it easier to establish and operate.  It is not intended to water down compliance as we simplify the law and make it more intelligible.  If the law is more accessible, it is more likely to ensure respect and compliance.  Although a process of simplification has been undertaken in drafting this Bill, it is a large and complex piece of legislation nonetheless.</p><p>  Company law is technical by nature.  The last major review and consolidation of Irish company law was over 50 years ago, in the lead-up to the Companies Act 1963.  Since then, there have been 15 amending Acts and numerous statutory instruments which are required to be read as one with the Companies Acts.  In that time, Ireland has taken on EU obligations in relation to the harmonisation of laws.  This has inevitably added to the volume and complexity of Irish company law.  Company law involves balancing many conflicting and possibly competing interests.  The legislation must balance these interests, including creditor protection, shareholder protection, corporate governance and incorporation and registration of companies.  This necessary balancing of interests undoubtedly contributes to the intricate nature of company law.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the complexity of the existing body of legislation, it was considered that company law could be simplified.  This Bill seeks to break company law into distinct principles and areas and remove or lessen administrative burdens, where possible and appropriate, bearing in mind that the public interest will sometimes require the introduction of additional regulation.  Some new provisions will reduce burdens on business and simplify the day-to-day operation of a company, thereby offering tangible benefits to the ordinary businessperson.  Changes in a number of procedures have been introduced to take account of technological and organisational developments in the conduct of business and communications and emerging best practice in corporate governance.  This will lighten the regulatory burden, particularly on private companies, while balancing the interests of members, creditors and the public.  This streamlining of the law will bring the Irish company law regime into the 21st century and ensure Ireland maintains a competitive edge as one of the best places in Europe and the world in which to do business.</p><p>  The Bill is the culmination of many years of work by my Department and the Company Law Review Group, CLRG.  The group is a statutory body that was set up in February 2000.  Its role is to advise the Minister on the reform and modernisation of company law.  The group includes all relevant stakeholder interests, with members from Government Departments, professional bodies including solicitors, barristers and accountants, employer and business interests, regulatory bodies; trade union interests and individual legal and finance practitioners.  The group has published 14 reports since its inception 13 years ago.  All of these reports have been available to access free of charge on its website.  By making its reports publicly available, the Company Law Review Group has ensured its decision-making process is transparent and the reasoning behind any recommendations issued by it can be dissected.  The general public and interested groups have been free to make submissions to the CLRG to express views or bring matters to its attention.  All such submissions are given due consideration.</p><p>  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the members of the CLRG for the sterling work they have done in shaping the Bill before the House today.  I understand that some of them are with us today.  Their interest in this work has endured to the start of the lengthy process of having this legislation passed.  In early 2007, the CLRG submitted its general scheme, which represented the outcome of more than six years of work.  In July 2007, the Government approved the formal drafting of a Bill along these lines.  The next significant milestone came in May 2011, when Volume 1 was published in draft form on my Department's website.  This gave all interested stakeholders an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed new legislation, to interrogate it from a technical perspective and to prepare themselves for its introduction.  Submissions were welcomed.  They were considered by the CLRG, by the Department and by me.  A number of suggestions were accepted and are included in the Bill as published.</p><p>  One of the principal innovations of the Companies Bill is reflected in its general structure.  For the first time in Irish company law, the most common company type - the private company limited by shares - is placed at the centre of the legislation as the default company.  The architecture of the Bill is inspired by the reality that almost 90% of companies currently registered at the Companies Registration Office, CRO, are private companies limited by shares.  Existing company law is peculiar in that it presupposes that the public limited company is at the centre of corporate life in Ireland, whereas in reality less than 1% of registrations are public limited companies.  Historically, legislation has never clearly distinguished the law applicable to private companies from the law applicable to public limited companies.  This has resulted in small businesses being faced with an apparently massive company law code, when in fact a considerable amount of it has no application to their particular business enterprise.  There is a world of difference between the one-person private company formed by a tradesperson and the large publicly listed limited company.</p><p>  Therefore, Volume 1, containing Parts 1 to 15 of the Bill, sets out to ring-fence the law applicable to the most common company type - the private company limited by shares, or &quot;the new LTD company&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.404" nospeaker="true" time="19:10:00" ><p>Again reflecting the simplified structural concept, Volume 1 is arranged to reflect the life cycle of the company, beginning with how a company is set up, followed by the provisions which apply when the company is in operation and, finally, the provisions which are relevant to closing the company down.

  Volume 2, comprising Parts 16 to 25 of the Bill and its Schedules, goes on to state how the law contained in Volume 1 is applied, disapplied or varied for each other company type.  These other company types are the designated activity company, the public limited company, the guarantee company, the unlimited company, the unregistered company and the investment company.  There are legitimate users of all the different company types laid down in the Bill and it is imperative that Irish company law should facilitate business and the wider community by making appropriate provision for different types of companies.

  For the new limited company, the Bill contains a number of significant reforms.  This company will have the same legal capacity as a natural person.  The current ultra vires rule does not apply to this new company type - the ultra vires rule is the legal doctrine whereby a company must have an &quot;objects clause&quot; in its memorandum of association.  This &quot;objects clause&quot; lists the activities which the company has power to undertake, with the consequence that any other activities are regarded as being beyond the powers of, or ultra vires, the company.  In practice, this can lead to companies drawing up exhaustive objects clauses to be certain they have the relevant powers, and can in some cases lead to legal disputes as to whether a company actually had power to undertake a certain activity.  Removing the need for an objects clause will both ease the administrative burden on companies and provide certainty to third parties, such as lenders, who will no longer have to examine extensive objects clauses to determine whether a company is acting within its powers.

  This company type will be allowed to have only one director.  Under the current law, a company must have at least two directors.  Even if one wishes to establish a business as a company on his or her own, he or she needs to find an additional person to act as the second director.  Removing this requirement will make it easier to start a new business.

  The new limited company can have a minimum of one member and up to a maximum of 149 members.  The 149 upper-limit is linked to the requirements of EU prospectus law, which governs the offer of shares to the public.

  The new limited company will have a single-document constitution, in contrast to the current law whereby every company must have two documents - a memorandum of association and separate articles of association.  A further benefit of the new legislation will be that the extensive and detailed provisions which every company currently needs to include in its own articles of association will now be brought into the main body of the legislation and will apply to each company by default.  However, most of these provisions can be modified by an individual company, if required to suit their specific needs.

  The new limited company will no longer be obliged to go through the formality of holding a &quot;physical&quot; AGM, whereby all of the members have to convene in one location at the same time on an annual basis.  Instead, the members will be able to hold a &quot;written&quot; AGM, whereby all of the matters which must be dealt with at the AGM can be approved by written procedure.

  The Bill contains a codified version of the fiduciary duties to which directors are currently subject by a combination of the common law and statutory provisions.  This brings all of these duties together in a single identifiable place, making it easier for directors to understand their responsibilities and more difficult to deny their existence.  This also addresses one of the recommendations of the Moriarty report in regard to company law.

  The Bill contains a &quot;summary approval procedure&quot;, which is applicable to a number of activities - for example, reduction of capital - which under the current law might require the company to undertake the burdensome and expensive process of securing court approval.  The new &quot;summary approval procedure&quot; incorporates safeguards in regard to directors' liability in circumstances where the procedure is used without proper justification.

  For the first time, all offences under company law have been streamlined under a new classification procedure which operates on the basis of four categories of offences, with category 1 being the most serious.  This will bring a structure and consistency to the offence provisions throughout the legislation.

  For the first time, it will be possible to merge two Irish private companies under the new Bill.  The procedure for this is modelled on the EU cross-border merger regulations, which are regarded as relatively straightforward to operate by the business and advisory community.

  Small companies will be able to apply directly to the Circuit Court for examinership instead of having to go through the High Court.  This will make examinership more accessible and reduce costs.

  A number of innovations which will apply to other company types include the following.  As already mentioned, each company type will have its own dedicated Part within the Bill, thereby improving the accessibility and visibility of the law for all users.  Part 20 enables any company to convert from its existing company type to any other company type which can be formed under the Bill, in contrast to the current law, which contains restrictions on  conversions.  This provides flexibility and greater options to companies which face a change in their circumstances.

  For the first time, guarantee companies will be able to avail of the audit exemption.  This innovation will be of significant benefit to the sectors which tend to use the guarantee company structure - for example, companies in the voluntary sector, charities and residential management companies - while at the same time recognising the particular circumstances applying to guarantee companies in allowing a single member to object.

  I now turn to the actual substance of the Bill.  Due to the unprecedented size of this Bill, it is not possible within the allocated time to give a detailed explanation for each of the 1,429 sections, as Members will be pleased to hear.  Instead, I will give an overview of the 25 constituent Parts of the Bill, along the way highlighting any significant changes to the law and explaining the policy behind these changes.  The supplementary information provided to the Deputies contains a more detailed overview at chapter-by-chapter level.

  Part 1 consists of 14 sections and is largely devoted to housekeeping.  It explains the structure of the Bill and it defines terms which are used throughout the Bill.

  Part 2 makes provision for the incorporation and registration of the new model private company limited by shares - the new limited company - and provides that any one or more persons may form such a company.  The distinction between a memorandum of association and articles of association has been abolished in this Part for the new model company type and these two documents are combined into a single document called a &quot;constitution&quot;.

  The most significant aspect of this Part is the provision for the conversion of an existing private company limited by shares to a new model private company limited by shares.  Following the enactment of the Bill, existing private companies limited by shares will have to decide whether to opt in to the new regime for private limited companies or to opt out by becoming a designated activity company or other company type.  Companies that do not elect to opt into the new regime will not be able to avail of the many advantages associated with the new model private company limited by shares, such as the ability to have only one director, the one-document constitution and the possibility to avoid a &quot;physical&quot; AGM.

  There are three ways in which an existing private company limited by shares can become this new model company type.  The recommended option is for the members of the company to adopt a new constitution by special resolution.  Schedule 1 sets out a template for this purpose to assist the company.  As an alternative to the special resolution, the directors can send the new constitution to each of the members and deliver a copy to the Companies Registration Office.  If the directors fail to take any action, the company will be deemed to have a constitution at the expiry of the transition period.  A company is entitled to opt out of the new regime and can do so by converting to a designated activity company or other company type.

  Part 3 consolidates all existing law relating to shares, share capital and certain other instruments.  At present, this law is set out across the three main Companies Acts.  Many provisions from Table A of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1963, which are commonly inserted into the articles of association of a company, are now incorporated into the text of the Bill and apply unless the company's constitution provides otherwise, thus reducing the amount of detail required in the constitution of the company.

  Part 4 deals with corporate governance and provides for the duties and responsibilities of directors and other officers as regards their appointment, their proceedings in regard to the company and its members and the ways in which the activities of the company on a day-to-day basis are conducted.  The procedures for corporate governance currently contained in the standard articles of association for a company limited by shares have been incorporated into the body of the Bill.  Additionally, the new limited company may adopt in its constitution such additional powers or restrictions as the company may require, so long as these provisions do not conflict with the main body of law in the Bill.

  This Part permits the new limited company to have a single director.  It also allows such a company to dispense with holding an AGM, where agreed unanimously by the members.  Provision is made for unanimous written resolutions, thus allowing a company to pass resolutions, including special resolutions, in writing.  This Part also sets out the new summary approval procedure which deals with restricted activities such as the giving of financial assistance for the acquisition of shares, making reductions in company capital, varying company capital and giving loans to directors and connected persons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300037#KK00100"><p>This reduces the burden and expense for companies that previously may have had to secure court approval for certain transactions.  Additionally, it simplifies and streamlines the current methods of effecting such transactions.  To ensure balance, it incorporates safeguards in respect of directors' liability if the procedure is used inappropriately.  Greater detail on the summary approval procedure is provided in the Deputies' handouts.</p><p>  Part 5 codifies for the first time in Irish law all the duties of directors and other officers of the company.  Up to now, these duties were to be found in the common law and in various statutory provisions.  They are set out now in their entirety for the sake of clarity and it is expected that this innovation in company law will promote compliance with such duties by directors and company officers.  Also dealt with in this part is the directors' compliance statement, which is now being introduced into law as recommended by the CLRG and approved by the Government in November 2005.  The requirement in these provisions applies to all public limited companies, except investment companies, and large limited companies.  It places on obligation on directors to make an annual statement in their directors' report, acknowledging that they are responsible for securing the company's compliance with its &quot;relevant obligations&quot; and confirming that certain things have been done or, if they have not been done, explaining why they have not been done.  Failure to prepare a director's compliance statement will constitute an offence under the Bill.</p><p>  Part 6 contains provisions regarding the accounting records to be kept by companies, the financial statements to be prepared by them, the periodic returns to be made by companies to the Registrar of Companies and the auditing of financial statements of the companies.  It also covers other matters related to auditors, particularly rules governing the appointment of statutory auditors and their removal from office.  To a large extent, the requirements are unchanged from existing law; however, the relevant provisions have been redrafted to make them easier to understand, in order to improve compliance.  One of the significant changes in this part is that the audit exemption has been extended to a group situation, so that in order to avail of the audit exemption, the company must be a small company or must be a group of companies that, taken together, fall below the threshold requirements for a small company.  In a case in which the exemption applies, at least 10% of the members of the company may still request that an audit take place.</p><p>  Part 7 contains provisions regarding debentures and charges and introduces a number of changes to the current law.  The thrust of the changes is to simplify the registration and deregistration of charges while clarifying the rules for the priority of charges.  A new two-stage procedure for the registration of charges is proposed.  It provides that an initial notice can be sent to the registrar stating the intention of the company to create a charge, followed up by a more detailed notification within 21 days of the creation of the charge stating that fact.  In this way, it is envisaged that lenders may be more willing to advance funds if they can achieve an enhanced security priority over a company's assets.  The rules governing the priority of charges have also been significantly changed in that, where the priority of charges is not governed by other regulation, such priority will be determined by reference to the date of receipt by the Registrar of Companies of the prescribed particulars.  This is in contrast to the current position whereby priority is deemed to be governed by the date of creation of the charge.  The CLRG was of the view that this practice is unfair and it was recommended that priority be given to the creditor who files first in order to minimise the potential for fraudulent abuse and thereby protect providers of finance.</p><p>  Part 8 deals with receivers.  It substantially re-enacts the current law on receivership as contained in the Companies Act 1963, as amended.  There are, however, some new provisions that set out the powers and duties of receivers.  Receivers are now given certain specific powers in this part in addition to those conferred on them by court order or the instrument under which they were appointed.  Conferring statutory powers on receivers is intended to alleviate many of the problems arising from poorly drafted debentures.</p><p>  Part 9 contains provisions relating to the reorganisation, acquisition, merger and division of companies.  The main innovation in this part is the provision for the first time in Irish law of a statutory mechanism whereby two private Irish companies can merge so that the assets, liabilities and corporate identity of one are transferred by operation of law to the other before the former is dissolved.  A further innovation is that a merger can be effected without the necessity for a High Court order.  Where a merger meets the requirements of the legislation, it is proposed that the summary approval procedure can be utilised to effect the merger, which can be expected to result in a significant saving of time and money.  The provisions dealing with divisions are also entirely new and have been drafted to mirror the corresponding provisions in this part on mergers.</p><p>  Part 10 contains the provision relating to examinerships.  It largely reproduces the provision on examinerships as contained in the 1990 Act.  A recent recommendation from the CLRG to me as Minister advised that changes be made to the law in order to facilitate access by small private companies to the examinership process.  The proposed amendment would allow such companies to apply directly to the Circuit Court to have an examiner appointed, so that they would not be required to apply to the High Court first, as is currently the case.  Small private companies will still have the option to apply to the High Court directly for examinership if they so wish under the Bill.  It is hoped that the immediate impact of this change will be lower costs and greater accessibility for small private companies to the examinership process due to the fact that it eliminates the requirement for any High Court involvement and all the associated costs.</p><p>  Part 11 consolidates and modernises the law relating to the winding up of companies.  In the first instance, the law relating to winding up has been reordered in a more logically coherent way and greater consistency has been introduced between the three different methods of winding up - members' voluntary, creditors' voluntary and court-ordered.  This is most evident in the changes to the court-initiated mode of winding up, which will reduce the court's supervisory role in favour of greater involvement for creditors.  Further changes are the introduction of new professional indemnity insurance requirements for liquidators and the requirement for a person to be qualified before acting as liquidator of a company.  </p><p>  Part 12 combines into one part the many diverse provisions of the current law regarding the striking off and restoration of companies.  The new provisions set out in one place all of the reasons a company may be struck from the register and, in another, the procedures for restoration to the register.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement will be empowered to require the directors of a company that is being struck off to produce a statement of affairs.  These directors can be required to appear before a court and answer on oath any question relating to the statement.</p><p>  Part 13 substantially  re-enacts, without any significant amendments, the law regarding the appointment of inspectors to companies and seeks to codify all law relating to the investigation of companies.  In keeping with the stricter approach to the enforcement of company law, Part 14 brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions, a change which will provide greater transparency.  A director may apply for relief from a restriction order at any stage during the restriction period but the Director of Corporate Enforcement must now also be included as a notice party in any application for relief.  A new provision is inserted whereby a company is prohibited from utilising the summary approval procedure where that company has a restricted director.  A new four-tier categorisation of offences is introduced.  It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions in the case of the most serious offences - for example, prospectus and market abuse offences - all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme.  The Deputies will find details of the scheme in their information packs.  A further new provision has been introduced which provides that, following a person's conviction for an offence under this Bill, the court may order that the person remedy any breach of the Bill in respect of which he or she was convicted.</p><p>  Part 15 contains provisions relating to the Registrar of Companies, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the CLRG.  For the first time, the powers and duties of both the Minister and these bodies are brought together in one coherent group of legislative provisions.  </p><p>  Part 16 makes provision for a type of private company to be known as a designated company, DAC.  The law in volume 1 applies to DACs as it does to the new LTD, subject to the exceptions set out in the table of disapplications and any other made in this part.  There will be two types of DAC under the Bill - a private company limited by shares and a private company limited by guarantee, having a share capital.  The primary and defining feature of a DAC will be the continued existence of an objects clause in the constitution of the company. </p><p>This is in contrast to the "new LTD company", dealt with in Volume 1 of the Bill, the constitution of which will no longer contain an objects clause.</p><p> The DAC limited by shares will be the closest type of company to the existing private company limited by shares under the current law.  During the transition period, existing private companies may elect whether to opt into the new regime for private companies or alternatively, to retain their objects clause by converting to a DAC.  Alternatively, an existing private company that does not wish to opt in to the new regime can do so easily by following the procedure laid down in the Bill.  It is envisaged that entities which would welcome the DAC include special purpose companies, for example, those incorporated for joint ventures or for use in a financial transaction.  However, the Bill does not restrict the availability of DACs to persons engaged in such activities.</p><p> Part 17 of the Bill is concerned with public limited companies, PLCs.  The law in Volume 1 applies to PLCs as it does to the new model private company limited by shares, subject to the exceptions set out in its table of disapplications and any other adaptations made in this Part.  The key difference between public limited companies and private companies is that only PLCs will be permitted to list their shares an a stock exchange and offer them to the public.  It is provided that the authorised minimum issued share capital of a PLC must be at least &euro;25,000 or such greater amount as the Minister may specify by order.  A PLC is now permitted to have as few as one member and there is no maximum number on the membership of such a company.  A PLC must have at least two directors.  A PLC is obliged to establish an audit committee and corporate governance provisions for certain PLCs are set out.</p></speech>

I am not reading quickly enough.</p><p>  Part 18 makes provision for companies limited by guarantee, not having a share capital.  Such companies are known as CLGs.  The law in Volume 1 applies to CLGs as it does to the new model private company limited by shares, subject to the exceptions set out its table of disapplications and adaptations made in this Part.  Since guarantee companies do not have a share capital, members of such companies do not have a distinct economic interest in their capital.  It is for this reason that CLGs are a popular type of company for charities, sports and social clubs and management companies.  A CLG may be exempt from the requirement to use such a suffix to its name, for example, if it has a charitable object.</p><p>  In a guarantee company, the members' liability is limited to such amount as they undertake in the constitution of the company to contribute to assets of the CLG in the event of its winding-up.  The audit exemption is now being extended to guarantee companies under the Bill if a company fulfils the criteria for a small company.  It is expected that this will benefit many guarantee companies that are charities or sports clubs, etc.  Any one member of the company is entitled to object to the exemption and thus force a company to carry out an audit.</p><p>  Part 19 makes provision for unlimited companies.  This Part is structured in such a way that it covers both private unlimited companies and public unlimited companies.  In this regard, three different types of unlimited companies are being catered for - the private unlimited company with a share capital, ULC, the public unlimited company with a share capital, PUC, and the public unlimited company that has no share capital, PULC.  All three types of unlimited company already exist.</p><p>  The law in volume 1 applies to unlimited companies as it does to the &quot;new LTD company&quot;, subject to the exceptions set out in the table of disapplications and any other adaptations made in this Part.  All types of unlimited company will be permitted to have just one member but will be required to have at least two directors.</p><p>  Part 20 makes provision for re-registration of companies.  A company will generally be permitted to re-register as another type of company, subject to complying with the requirements applicable to the latter company type.  Re-registration will involve the passing of a special resolution and the delivery of certain documents including a compliance statement to the CRO.  Additional requirements may apply, depending on the type of company, following re-registration.</p><p>  Part 21 makes provision for the registration and disclosure requirements of external companies, also referred to as foreign companies or overseas companies, which have been formed and registered outside the State but which have a connection with Ireland.  The company law review group has proposed that the law in relation to external companies be modified from the current position which provides for both the concept of &quot;place of business&quot; and the concept of &quot;branch&quot;, to a position where the new law would provide only for the &quot;branch&quot; concept.  By not retaining the concept of &quot;place of business&quot;, it is hoped to remove the uncertainty of the current law whereby it can be unclear whether a particular company is a branch or a place of business.  The consequence of this will be that external companies can elect to register as a branch and will thus be required to file accounts.</p><p>  Part 22 deals with unregistered companies and joint stock companies and the application of the Bill to companies formed or registered under previous Acts.  It also provides a mechanism for an unregistered company to register as a PLC.  The most important unregistered company in Ireland is the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland.</p><p>  Part 23 contains the provisions relating to prospectus law, market abuse law, and transparency law.  In particular, provisions are set out regarding the consequences of a breach of a measure forming a part of any of these, and requiring a company with traded securities to prepare a corporate governance statement.  For the sake of clarity, these provisions are housed in a stand-alone Part rather than in Part 17 of the Bill on PLCs, as originally envisaged in the general scheme.</p><p>  Part 24 of the Bill makes provision for the establishment of companies as investment companies, currently provided for under the 1990 Act.  In order to be permitted to operate, these companies must be authorised by the Central Bank.  Such companies are a key constituent of the set of legal structures under which the international collective investment funds industry operates in Ireland.  An investment company is a type of PLC.</p><p>  Part 25 of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions that do not naturally fit in any preceding Parts of the Bill, such as foreign insolvency proceedings, the prohibition on partnerships with more than 20 members and certain public auditor requirements.</p><p>  In conclusion, I am delighted with the significant benefits which the Bill will bring to all companies, big and small, across the country.  It will make it easier to run a business as a company.  An entrepreneur will be able to start a company with a single director.  Time will not need to be spent on convening and holding a formal AGM.  There will be no need for ordinary businesses to be tied up with objects clauses and articles of association, although the Bill will retain these concepts for those companies that need them.</p><p>  This Bill will enhance Ireland's competitive position as a place in which to start or to grow a business.  Indeed, it will feed directly into the Government's aim to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  I look forward to working with Deputies on progressing this Bill to enactment.  I believe it will bring significant benefits to companies and to business life in Ireland.  </p><p>  I wish to thank all those who have worked on the drafting of this Bill.  The House has only seen the tip of the iceberg of work which has been done.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I thank him also for the information on the Bill provided by his office over the past number of days.  I compliment all the officials involved and all those who have been involved since 2000, the members of the Company Law Review Group.  I suspect they feel like parents seeing their child go off to school for the first time - they have nurtured and cared for this child and they will worry what will happen next.  I assure them we will look after it.  We will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage and in the interests of the child's education we might make some suggestions on Committee Stage.</p><p>  I previously expressed frustration at the slow pace of the preparation of the Bill.  However when preparing my contribution I read the 1962 debate.  The then Minister introduced the Bill on 14 November 1962.  He apologised that the preparation of the Bill had taken rather longer than he had expected.  The Opposition spokesman, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, paid tribute to the work of the company law reform committee which had been set up in 1951 and reported in 1958.  The legislation eventually came to the House in 1962.  Everything changes but many things remain the same.  I commend the phenomenal job of work.  The Bill is an excellent example of tidying up legislation while maintaining very strong legislation in all areas.  The legislation has been simplified but the message must be that it is not being made easier to evade one's responsibilities as a company director or company operator.  The Minister made it clear on a number of occasions that the Bill is designed to provide easier access to information and to legislation.</p><p>People's responsibilities in providing for that ease of access are far clearer now.  There can be no question of evading their responsibilities on the basis of a failure to understand.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill on Second Stage.  The other State agency involved is the Health and Safety Authority, with which I was threatened if I sent someone from my office to collect a physical copy of the Bill from the Minister's Department.  It has probably fallen through the floor in the Minister's office so we have used the online version.  It is a credit to all of the work done on the Bill that there has been very little criticism of it given the impact it will have on company life.  The manner in which the Company Law Review Group communicated its work consistently during its tenure and in which the Minister has engaged with interested bodies has ensured a general welcome for the legislation.  There is now encouragement and a demand that legislators get on with its implementation.  The Opposition spokesman in the 1962 debate, Liam Cosgrave, proposed a special committee.  The Minister had the same proposal but it is not going to happen.  We will work to enact the legislation and when it has been, the Minister will have a responsibility to educate people about it.  There is a danger that the extent of changes is so great that many organisations will seek to make a quick buck on it.  While we are all in favour of enterprise, the LEOs and the enterprise board structure should be implemented at an early stage to educate people and companies as to the changes which are being made.  The voluntary sector must be involved also as some of the most significant changes hidden in the Bill relate to making the work of voluntary organisations a great deal easier.  A great deal of work must be done to provide information on the legislation and to let people know that things have changed and will be much easier.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes anything that makes it easier to do business and create jobs.  It is vital that any legislation be clear and accessible, which is a test the Bill passes in most respects.  As the first report of the Company Law Reform Group pointed out, company law reform has generally been driven by crises, of which we have seen many in the last few years, the need to comply with EU directives and regulations, important innovations in peer jurisdictions and lacunae identified in the course of company law investigations or tribunals of inquiry.  It is significant that some of the recommendations in the Moriarty report are included in the legislation.  Deputy Bruton is the first Fine Gael Minister to acknowledge the report, which is a welcome development.  The establishment of the Company Law Review Group in 2000 made clear the desirability of reviewing the companies code on an ongoing basis.  The review process must continue when the legislation is passed.  We must not leave a future Oireachtas in the position we are in now of having to introduce a massive Bill.  Future Oireachtais will have to commit to ongoing review.</p><p> The review group was tasked to simplify the Companies Acts to create greater clarity and transparency in the companies' code and to increase its accessibility for business people.  It has done so.  In proposing simplifications, the review group recommended an increased focus on the needs of small private limited companies, in which respect it fully endorsed the think-small-first approach favoured by the Company Law Steering Review Group in the UK.  The principles to be followed are that the law should be clear and accessible; that there should be no undue sacrifice of accuracy and certainty in an attempt to make the law superficially more accessible, and that legislation should be structured so as to ensure that the provisions applying to small companies are identifiable.  I welcome the way the relevant law has been broken up into sections.  As the group made clear, a body of law that affords protections to shareholders and creditors, while legislating for the orderly administration of solvent and insolvent entities, can never be really simply.  There is no doubt that the Bill passes all of the tests while retaining a high bar for people who enter into the company law sphere.  Locating all provisions in one Act will reduce complexity for all end users.  In terms of competitiveness and our international standing, the legislation will be among the newest and, possibly, clearest regimes in Europe.  Clarity in the years to come will depend on the range of amending legislation.</p><p> The Bill does not alter drastically basic concepts of company law including limited liability, shares and membership, the roles, duties and obligations of directors and other company officers or the liabilities of companies to creditors and employees.  The major changes are geared towards streamlining mechanisms which allow companies to be easier to operate and do business with.  Changes addressed to the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i>for companies limited by shares grant companies the full, unlimited capacity to carry on any business or do any act, which is not contrary to the general law, and will result in greater simplicity and certainty for people doing business with them while reducing the time and expense involved in company formation.  The reform will not apply to public limited companies.  In recent years, there has been a great deal of public frustration that the investigation of breaches of company law has been slow.  Breaches have been so technical that in many cases that investigating authorities did not have sufficient resources to investigate.  We must ensure that the Bill is proofed against such breaches.  There must be a review clause in the Bill to ensure that the legislation is reviewed and amended on an ongoing basis to ensure that trends in business, company law internationally and the legal business can be tracked without having to wait for a long legislative process.</p><p> Regulation is essential for the proper functioning of society.  Whether through primary or delegated legislation or more informal arrangements, rules provide clear guidance and a solid basis for stability and progress.  Some regulators have a primarily economic function to ensure the harmonious use of a shared resource and to guard against anti-competitive practices in particularly vulnerable sectors.  While regulation is often necessary to achieve a country's social, economic and environmental objectives, it also imposes costs on businesses, consumers, Government and the wider community.  It may be that the way in which some regulations have evolved has led to a situation where they have become unnecessarily complex and costly to comply with.  It may also be that the originally intended benefit of regulations can be achieved more simply and cheaply.  The administrative burden of regulation can be significant, especially for small businesses.  As well as imposing the cost of dealing with red tape, regulation may cause businesses to adjust production processes in a way that adds to costs.  Inappropriately designed regulation may also have adverse effects on innovation and entrepreneurship while reducing productivity and competition.  I emphasise that reducing the burden is not about deregulation or making regulation less stringent.  Examples of good practice already put in place include the online motor tax system and online revenue services, which show the benefits which can be achieved by reducing administrative burdens without altering the substance of the regulations themselves.  In many ways, the operation of those regimes provides a good template for the implementation phase of the Bill.</p><p> The World Bank's 2013 report on doing business compares domestic regulation for firms worldwide and puts Ireland 15th of 183 countries for ease of doing business.  It is worth pointing out that those countries that come ahead of Ireland in the survey were not necessarily those with a reputation for having deregulated economies.  All of the Scandinavian countries rated ahead of Ireland, with Denmark and Norway in the top six, Finland in 11th and Sweden in 13th place.  There were areas in which we scored particularly well.  We came joint first in making contracts enforcement easier in terms of the number of procedures involved.  We came sixth in the protection of investors and in payment of taxes.  We came tenth in relation to the ease of starting a business.  The provisions of the Bill will allow us to improve the ease of starting a business.  Where we did not do well was in electricity access, registering property and, ironically enough, trading across borders.</p><p> I welcome the provisions in the Bill which deal with examinership and aim to reduce its cost burden to open the process to small businesses.  Almost 1,000 jobs with small firms were saved through the examinership process in 2012, representing a year-on-year increase of 67% on 2011.  The legal costs of examinership could be cut by up to 50% through the Bill's provisions to make it a more accessible and affordable option for SMEs.  This has the potential to double the number of jobs that are saved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.411" nospeaker="true" time="19:50:00" ><p>Anything that can assist in saving jobs in SMEs and can assist viable SMEs get through a difficult trading process is to be welcomed.</p><p>Companies, along with many other institutions, have taken a battering in recent times.  There is no sense in us putting much work, in the coming weeks and months, into the Bill unless the enforcement side of the Department is beefed up.  The enforcement side and the resources available to the Companies Registration Office are insufficient given the number of cases being fought in respect of breaches of company law in recent years.  I appreciate it is a time of constrained resources but if we are to rebuild confidence in the business community and implement the spirit of the Bill in making it easier to set up a business, we must examine the resources available to company law enforcement within the Minister's Department.  The difficulty in introducing the legislation is that people will use the big change to justify reckless behaviour.  The message must go clearly from the House that it will not be tolerated.  The same message must go from the Minister's enforcement agencies in their public utterances in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Various groups have welcomed the Bill, including some that do not often welcome the measures of this Government.  The ISME chief executive, Mr. Mark Fielding, welcomes the requirement for one director to start a business.  It will assist many people.  The Minister referred to sole traders and we all know people who drag others into the company process, which leads to difficulties, for the sake of making up the one extra person.  Mr. Fielding also points to the anomalies and expense added by the confusion that company law represents for small businesses.  He is hopeful the cost and burden of running a small business will be substantially reduced if the proposals are implemented.  The Small Firms Association has acknowledged significant benefits by reducing red tape and making company law obligations easier to understand.  The obligations continue to exist and the bar is high but they are more accessible and understandable.</p><p>Legislation often appears in the House with the best of intentions and we see it through Committee Stage and the Seanad and then various agencies add to it when it comes to be implemented.  They goldplate the legislation.  We are particularly good at goldplating EU regulations.  I hope we do not goldplate the Bill to the extent that its provisions, its cost saving measures and accessibility revert to the current position.  Goldplating the Bill in its implementation should not create barriers for those accessing the benefits of the Bill.  It is vital the Minister ensures that does not happen.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and I compliment all involved in it.  I am sure many involved in the Bill have retired from the Department and we think of them and wish them well.  I assure the officials and the Minister that we will look after the child as it goes through the school process.  We will table a series of amendments to improve the Bill on Committee Stage but, generally, we are supportive of the Bill.  The sooner we can get it implemented and the sooner companies, business people and those who want to start businesses at this time can gain the benefit of the Bill, the better.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; tar &eacute;is Bille &iacute;ontach, tabhactach and cuimsitheach a chruth&uacute;.  </p><p>  I fully endorse the approach taken.  It is unusual that the Minister and I are on the same side for three Bills in a row.  I am sure normal business will resume soon enough.  The work done by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, the Department, the Minister and previous Governments has led to this Bill.  It is an impressive Bill with multiple facets facing companies and ensuring the highest standards in corporate governance.  The best place to address issues is among those closest to the issues.  The approach of bringing together such a diverse and inclusive group of legal practitioners, representatives of various strands and sectors of business, and trade unions to address a common concern is a new benchmark in developing legislation.  It should be replicated elsewhere.  I am sure many representatives who served on the CLRG never thought this phase would end but the legislation is now with us.</p><p>  The CLRG had over ten years to develop the ideas and work with the Department on drafting of the legislation.  Given the impact and scale of the legislation, I hope the Minister will allow significant time for its discussion and debate.  The implications of the legislation are deep and profound for business, the community and the wider sector.  It is reputed to be the largest item of legislation tabled in the State and we should give it due consideration.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in comes at this legislation from a positive perspective.  We share the aims of the Bill and will work to ensure its timely process through the Oireachtas.  The points we raise and the amendments we will propose are for the purpose of simplification and streamlining the process and reducing cost to business, while maintaining the highest level of commercial probity and governance.  I hope the Minister will take on board the points we raise, provide clarity, review our contribution and, where possible, amend the legislation.</p><p>  Over 12 years ago, the CLRG was tasked with the mission to bring forward proposals to develop company legislation.  Its mission statement was &quot;to promote enterprise, facilitate commerce, simplify the operation of the Companies Acts, enhance corporate governance and encourage commercial probity&quot;.  The legislation, as presented, addresses these matters in a comprehensive and detailed fashion.  Central to the legislation is the need to simplify the legal framework.  For seven years, I worked in business consultancy with businesses starting off and plotting their way through every stage of commerce.  For many businesses, it was very difficult to navigate the legal framework governing the area.  This simplification is welcome.</p><p>  Recent times are littered with cases in which corporate governance and commercial probity were secondary to the reduction in regulation and oversight and the elevation of the pursuit of profit at all costs.  Society is paying a dear price for that.  We have seen how the banking sector and property development benefited and profited from sharp practice.  We have seen how auditors passed company accounts as solid only for the company to collapse shortly after, leaving huge debts and having an impact on downstream SME creditors that makes it impossible for them to struggle and survive.  Through this, we saw workers losing their jobs and livelihoods.  We see daily cases of directors in front of the courts pursued for assets that appear to be lost in myriad companies and subsidiaries.  The business practices and ethos of the past brought this State to its knees.  It provides cases studies to compare the effectiveness of the legislation. </p><p>  The key test is the difference the legislation has on our society, on reigning in sharp practice and on promoting sustainable regulated frameworks for business.  Will the legislation promote reasonable, responsible and open business?  I am also mindful that entrepreneurs face major costs in business start-up.  Start-up is the key time for enterprise in our society  Many people have ideas but not the wherewithal to put the ideas into concrete and bring them to fruition.  Each week, I am contacted by SMEs across Meath and across the State with regard to meaningless bureaucracy and replication of administration.  There is a balance between proper oversight and regulation and bureaucracy.</p><p>The Minister stated this legislation would save &euro;6 million per year in professional fees for start-ups.  I would say the figure would be less.  If businesses had been fulfilling previous guidelines and legislation and we were going into a different sphere, there probably would be a difference of that amount of money.  However, in many cases, businesses changed their practices to suit the reality in which they were existing.  The legislation had become archaic and businesses had moved on.  The Government could do more to reduce costs in many other areas, including utilities, property and transport, but they are cases for another day.</p><p> I will focus on the role of private limited companies which account for 90% of company types and the simplification of the business constitution.  The need for the bulk of businesses to have detailed objectives and articles of memorandum had been a hoop through which many business continually had to jump and it had become less relevant to their day-to-day work.  The simplification of this process will promote greater flexibility for existing companies while easing the process for start-ups.</p><p> Given the flexibility offered by the new form of private limited company, will the Minister outline the benefit to companies of the designated activity company, which sectors would most benefit and the expected take-up levels?  I can see the sense of, and agree with, the reduction of directors down to one as a business practice.  People were just finding names to put down on paper.  Many people agreed to become paper directors without knowledge of what this entailed and of their responsibilities or their liabilities.  The allowance of a single director should end this practice and ensure the actual director is identified and has full knowledge of the business.  However, writ large on this matter are the corporate governance issues that can arise with a single uncontested director.  It is important to ensure it is not abused.  How will the new system ensure a full separation from vested interests and the cross-payment of contacts to companies in which the director may have an interest?  Who will hold the single director to account?  Will this be the role of director of corporate enforcement?  I will return to the issue of compliance later. </p><p> I welcome the inclusion of the full list of responsibilities of directors in the legislation and while there is considerable case law behind these responsibilities, I remain concerned as to the vagueness of some concepts.  I refer to the behaviour of directors, such as the requirement to act &quot;honestly an responsibly&quot;.  These subjective terms will be further tested in case law but more could be done to enhance corporate governance and commercial probity. </p><p> One such aspect is the full disclosure of material and access to company information.  Will the legislation provide that a director must list all other companies in which he or she may have a beneficial interest?  Does it ensure that the contracts and payments between related companies are at market value?  Will directors be personally liable to provide full information and access to all financial records to auditors in the preparation of annual accounts?  </p><p> This point is central to the sharp practices which have been allowed to develop and the inaction between auditors and directors.  The auditor process is seen to be an independent assessment of the business when, in fact, it is only a &quot;true and fair&quot; reflection of the information provided.  Company directors can claim a clean bill of health by non-disclosure of material information and auditors can claim they were only working on the material provided.  We have audits which can be free of responsibility or liability.  As we have seen, the public has paid the price for this accounting and legal grey area in the past.  </p><p> Surely the highest levels of corporate governance should entail that there is full disclosure of information and that the books are fully open for auditors.  Will the Minister ensure the legislation fully reflects the need for openness and that responsibility for full disclosure rests with the directors with relevant legal sanction and that auditors are liable for their findings if they have failed to ask the right questions and make a full and accurate report? </p><p> It is clear that the defence of &quot;true and fair&quot;, with the caveat of the information provided, has failed business, failed the economy and failed workers, consumers and creditors.  It would be of benefit if, in addition to the annual accounts, the audit was to include an assessment of corporate governance and listing any labour court findings or other legal judgments in regard to the company directors.  Such an approach to audit would be reflective of the scale of the enterprise.  We are seeking a process that would be proportionate in cost and in terms of the size of the company.</p><p> In addition, while the legislation includes the criminal sanctions against directors, I hope the Minister and the Department will clarify the process by which a director will be liable for non-disclosure or abuse of position in  regard to any vested interests.  The business and organisation of companies has changed much in the past decade and this reflects the need for this legislation.  The development of joint enterprises and the widening the investment bases is reflected in the legislation with increasing numbers of investors.</p><p> Directors of a company can be found on two or more continents.  However, the legislation still holds with the practice of the company stamp signature.  I understand a company must have a signature but this increasingly online world and the environment in which we live makes this physical manifestation of a signature a little bit outdated and obsolete.  Will the Minister outline the reason for continued reliance on a company stamp and if the legislation will fully provide for electronic signatures? </p><p> More than 90% of all enterprises in this State are in the SME sector and account for 78% of employment.  While they account for 50% of all turnover, this turnover has a greater impact on the domestic economy than the multinationals and financial sector because these SMEs are part of the ecosystem of the economy.  When one business fails, it often has a far more negative impact on the rest of the SME sector, costing more jobs.  </p><p> Most of this business is based on goodwill and reliance on audits and tax compliance to ensure payment is certain.  Given how the current banking crisis is being played out in the SME sector, credit is tight and cash flow for many is on a knife edge.  It is clear SMEs cannot carry any additional debt.  Given that the Government has claimed that all policies will be SME-proofed to ensure they do not have an negative impact on the sector, I am concerned that this legislation has raised the level of winding-up petition to &euro;10,000.  Many SMEs would be out of business before they would reach this level as a creditor.  Will the Minister review this level and reduce it to fully reflect the needs and recent experience of SMEs?  This is not to promote a race to litigation but to ensure that businesses are paid and non-viable enterprises do not continue to trade and drag down other enterprises.  This week I worked with a business which was sub-contracted to another firm which had not paid tax for approximately four or five years.  The sub-contractor was never aware that was the case and had invested in his company while this process was occurring. </p><p> I had hoped the Bill would include a clause on prompt payments.  This is another area causing significant problems in the economy.  Many businesses are not getting paid on time and the larger companies are using more muscle to ensure they do not have to pay on time and are using that cash flow for their own purposes in their businesses.  I urge the Minister to review this position and include a provision, as called for by the SME sector.</p><p> In regard to the credit crisis facing the SME sector, I raise the issue of mergers and divisions.  We welcome the clarity the legislation will bring to the process.  The process of mergers, as laid out, is sensible, straightforward and clear.  I hope this will allow for companies to merge when it is in their best interests and in a fashion which is timely and cost-effective. </p><p> As the Minister will acknowledge, many viable businesses were encouraged to diversify into property and were incentivised to invest in developing their premises.  These debts are now undermining enterprises and the relationship with the banking sector.</p><p>We heard Ms Fiona Muldoon state recently that half of the &euro;58 billion in impaired debt was within the SME sector.  Much of it is related to the construction sector but approximately 35% of the non-construction sector SME loans are impaired.  Many good, healthy businesses with good products and customers are being dragged down by their marriage to that debt.  In this legislation we are looking for a system for the separation of performing viable enterprises from their impaired property assets.  Has the Minister a view on this?  Could it form part of the process of dealing with legacy debt in the SME sector?</p><p> As I stated, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the objectives of this legislation and the majority of the proposals made in it.  It supports fully the need to promote enterprise and ease the process of establishing and running a business.  It is clear that the Irish, both here and abroad, are entrepreneurs, workers and businesspeople and, if given half a chance, will create, build and enjoy profits.  We support a Government that creates an opportunity for the people concerned to establish businesses and promote employment here in Ireland.</p><p> This legislation begins to shape a legal framework for enterprise development.  We need policies on investment by the Government to promote sustainable enterprise.  In itself, a robust legal framework for the economy will not create growth or employment.  In the recent past we have seen the growth of start-up businesses, but we have also seen, unfortunately, an increase in business closures.  I fully accept that not all businesses will succeed and that the changing operating environments will make some businesses redundant.  Business failure is a component of the enterprise culture.  We should not stigmatise or be afraid of business failure; it happens and we need to provide legislation to deal with it.</p><p> With regard to this process, I have some concerns about the legislation that I hope the Minister will address.  The legislation includes changes regarding charges, property and debentures.  I would like the Minister to confirm that these changes will not materially affect the claims for redundancy by workers arising from business closures.  Will he confirm that the position of the workers made redundant will be such that they will be regarded as priority creditors?</p><p> As the Minister will acknowledge, some businesses may face a challenge to survive.  At times, we need to protect these businesses and give them a process of rebuilding, restructuring, etc.  The process of examinership offers the protection of the courts during this period of business transition.  Recently, many retailers have entered examinership as a way to address the cost base.  B&amp;amp;Q is an example.  Upward only rents undermined its business.  In this case, the examinership process is an area in which the stakes are very high.  The closure of the business and a large-scale loss of employment is one of the possible outcomes if the landlord fails to engage meaningfully in the examinership process.  However, the process is extremely costly and not an option for many SMEs.  I note that the Minister is aware of this.  I hope that legislation will be brought forward to reduce the cost of the process such that some SMEs will be helped to continue to trade.</p><p> Will the Minister clarify whether he believes the legislation fully meets the need of SMEs for an examinership-lite option for smaller businesses.  The other option for businesses in crisis is a process of receivership, which is the last option for many.  However, the recent example of the publishers of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>entering receivership and coming out at the other end over the period of a weekend is a concern.  The outcome of the process appears to be that the beneficial ownership of the company remains but the printing contract was cancelled and reassigned to another provider.  I am aware that this case is with the courts, but I hope the Minister will address the issue to ensure receivership does not become the norm for businesses seeking to break contracts without compensation and changes to beneficial ownership.</p><p> Given the time constraints and the size and import of this legislation, I have only had the opportunity to raise some of the technical matters of concern.  I will address the other issues during Committee and Remaining Stages.  I hope the Minister will provide support for the committee, through his Department, by way of advice and information.</p><p> The changes envisaged in the legislation can make the legal framework for business simpler and more cost-effective.  The legislation also has the potential to enhance corporate governance and commercial probity.  While the vast majority of businesses work well and to the highest standards, a few will pursue sharp practices for profit and other SMEs will pick up the cost.  Central to the success of legislation will be the compliance and support of enterprises.  I ask the Minister to resource fully activities such as those of the county enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland and other organisations that support enterprise development.  These bodies will make good the changes envisaged in the legislation.  They will educate businesses in order that they will understand the legislation fully and run healthily.</p><p> I ask the Minister to re-examine the supports and information available for businesses to deal fully with this process of transition.  He should ensure directors fully understand the changes.  There is a need for robust compliance mechanisms to ensure the responsibilities of directors are met fully and adhered to.  This should not be a matter for businesses at a time of crisis.  It must include the auditing process and an overview of governance in an operating business.</p><p> Will the Minister confirm that additional resources will be made available to the Office of Corporate Enforcement?  The annual report should list judgments, including Labour Court judgments against a company or directors, and also an assessment of corporate governance.</p><p> As I stated, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the objectives of the Bill which it approaches from a position of seeking practical changes that would improve it.  It looks forward to many hours of discussion with the Minister on it.</p></speech>

A commitment the Minister made before his election was to introduce it.  In the short time available to me I want to speak on the benefits to SMEs afforded by the Bill.  Sadly, it does not address the issue of companies dealing with workers' rights.  The Minister may well say this should not be part of the Bill, but, having spoken to many trade unionists and company representatives, I believe it should.  SMEs provide more than one third of all private sector employment in Ireland.  As we know only too well, the financial crisis is having a severe effect on them.  </p><p>  There is much to be welcomed in the Bill.  Many of the changes it proposes to introduce should help small and medium-sized businesses, in particular.  I especially welcome the changes that will allow for some of the 12,500 private companies limited by shares which are established every year to incorporate more easily.  This will result in an average saving of &euro;1,200 in professional fees in each case.  Anything that can be done to save jobs and keep businesses trading is welcome.  The Bill's introduction of an affordable examinership regime will make the process a more accessible and affordable option for SMEs.</p><p>  Under current legislation, only 1% of SMEs are using the courts to enter into examinership to try to trade out of their difficulties owing to the high costs they would face.  I certainly hope it is true, as some industry experts are predicting, that the Bill, once enacted, will double the number of SME jobs saved this year.  Perhaps the Minister might go into some detail on why he believes this will be the case.</p><p>  The sad reality is that no matter how many companies or jobs are saved by opening up the examinership process, hundreds of companies will be lost, having gone into receivership.  Approximately 2,000 company insolvencies last year resulted in receivership or liquidation.</p><p>This was a 43% increase on the previous year.  We need to find out the reason for this and to examine in more detail what can be done to help companies which want to remain in business but are finding it difficult, because of existing legislation, to do so.  The Minister should as part of this Bill introduce measures to protect workers in this instance.  It is appalling that we are allowing a situation to prevail whereby staff who have lost their jobs have to engage in sit-ins to obtain moneys owed to them.  As the Minister will be aware, workers are often the most vulnerable when a company goes into receivership or liquidation.  In such circumstances workers should be paid first.  Currently, this is not the case.  Invariably employees are not the cause of a small or large business going bust yet when a liquidator is appointed they are the last on the list to be paid.  It is wrong to allow this treatment of people who often have given many years of service to a company.</p><p> In one case in which I was involved - a pound shop in Waterford which went into liquidation - the liquidator told the employees that the store would be cleared out and that everybody from the ESB, gas company and product manufacturers would be paid and they would not.  This is fundamentally bad treatment of people who deserve better and who had no hand, act or part in a company going into liquidation in the first instance.  Often the amounts they are owed is very small.  It may only be a week's wages, holiday pay or over-time payments, which amounts are not extraordinary in the larger scheme of a company going bust.  I accept and understand that companies run out of money and go bust.  However, it is wrong that we do not have in place legislation to protect workers where this happens.</p><p> A case in which I am currently involved relates to workers who are still fighting for redundancy payments three years after the company closed despite that an employment appeals tribunal ruled in their favour.  I dealt with another case involving a UK based company which ceased its Irish operations and left its workers high and dry.  I am currently dealing with another company, the workers of which were told it was going into liquidation, that they could do nothing about it and that the company would try to get them their statutory redundancy but which the following day re-opened under a different name having taken on new employees for less money.  It is fundamentally wrong that people can be treated like this.  I agree that companies are suffering and that we must do everything we can to help them remain profitable and in existence in the current circumstances.  Anything we can do to help them must be done.  However, we also have a responsibility to the many people who helped such companies become profitable and remain open, many of whom have taken a 24% to 30% cut in wages.  These people should not be thrown on the scarp heap and left to fend for themselves.  It can take up to six months to get a hearing with an appeals tribunal and up to six or seven weeks, sometimes longer, to obtain a social welfare payment.  These workers have families and children but are being left to fend for themselves while we enact legislation to ensure companies, their management and directors are treated well.  I am not too sure if what I am proposing can be provided for in this legislation or would need to be addressed by way of additional legislation.  However, I ask that the Minister give consideration to it.  The Minister needs to get his act together in terms of the introduction of tighter legislation to protect not only companies, which I accept should be protected, but their biggest asset, namely, their workers.</p><p> The Department of Finance conference last week was told that the chief barrier to growth for all small and medium sized enterprises is not as one might believe access to credit but an inability to find consumers for their products and services.  I did not want to let this opportunity pass without making reference to this issue.  The drop in demand for goods and services will be exacerbated as long as the Government continues to hack away at the incomes of low and middle income families.  Small and medium sized businesses are our largest employers.  As I have stated previously, the biggest problem with which SMEs are faced having paid rates, rent and workers' wages is a lack of customers coming into their shops an so on to purchase their products.  It is important not to let this opportunity pass without saying that.  Under Croke Park II, some workers were asked to take a reduction in pay that was equivalent to the 11.7% they had already lost.  I strongly urge the Government, if it wants businesses to succeed, to bear this in mind before proceeding with any further public sector pay cuts or austerity measures.</p><p> I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this lengthy Bill, all of which I have not had time to read.  It is important we make it easier for companies to produce, display and sell.  Small companies will say that legislation, regardless of that for which it provides, means nothing if the consumer does not purchase the products produced, be it tea, a car or a meal.  As I stated earlier, I do not have a problem with this Bill but would welcome a response from the Minister to some of the issues I have raised, including on the SMEs and companies which go into receivership or examinership.  I ask also that he consider the introduction on Committee Stage of amendments to compel companies which go into liquidation to look after the rights of the employees who worked for them and helped to build them and who are often the last to be looked after when a company goes bust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300043#QQ00200"><p>As a small businessman of 32 years and sole trader who transferred to a company a year ago, I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am also involved in a number of companies limited by guarantee, which are a different animal altogether.</p><p>  I welcome the efforts being made in this area.  I heard the contributions made by the Minister and main spokespersons.  This legislation deals with issues such as over-view, examinations and so on, all of which are necessary.  I was shocked to hear that the Bill comprises 15 Parts and 1,300 pages and that a copy of it costs &euro;109, which is an enormous amount of money for any businessman, director or member of the public.  The cost is excessive and the Bill is too lengthy.  Very few directors would have time to read its 1,300 pages.  One could read a novel by the late Maeve Binchy or even Deputy Shane Ross's book on the bankers quicker.  I do not seek to promote any book above another.</p><p>  Bureaucracy is creating huge difficulties for businesses.  We have been constantly told over the past 15 to 20 years, or even longer, that this level of bureaucracy is required under EU regulation.</p><p>I have found on inquiring about the position in other EU member states that while EU regulations might be introduced here, we tend to add a number of statutory instruments to them.  We have a great knack for making the position cumbersome and more difficult.  The banking crisis, which is a huge problem, came about because of a lack of regulation.  The regulations that were in place were not enforced, and previous regulators and others were well paid but did not do their job; rather, they allowed people to run amok.  I hope some effort will be made under the legislation to address this issue but I do not have huge faith in that being achieved due to the lack of due process for anyone on foot of the banking scandal and the collapse of our economy.  Those senior people and some big business people who flouted the law with impunity are still laughing all the way to the bank.  Ordinary people - especially, in this case, ordinary workers, as Deputy Halligan said, and those with SMEs - are carrying the can and feeling the full brunt of the law.  I expect every businessman, whether he be a sole trader or the owner of a company, to obey the rules, act responsibly at all times, pay his taxes, ensure health and safety considerations are up to date and provide for the safety of his employees in the workplace.  </p><p> The Minister, who meets representatives of companies every day of the week, will know that we have suffered from over-regulation and over-emphasis by entities such as NERA, and it has gone over the top.  As with everything else, rules were needed; 1913 was the year of the Lock-out with the trade unions, and they were badly needed and fought to be recognised, but, ironically, there are cases now in which the pendulum has swung too much the other way.  We have a culture of over-regulation; there are too many institutions and agencies dealing with small business employers and their employees.  </p><p> It took from 1958, the year I was born, to 1962 to introduce the current Act, and I appreciate that it needs to be changed, but I cannot accept the sheer volume of reading material, regulations and all that is in this legislation.  However, I accept that many of the reforms in it are badly needed.  The company law review group has introduced countless reports and has been working on the legislation for a long time but we, the legislators, must be conscious in dealing with the legislation in this House and in the committee that it must be workable, it must be manageable and it must do what it says on the tin.  What it says on the tin is that we must have tight and stiff regulation, penalties and reporting procedures to ensure there will be no white-collar and big business tax evasion and none of what has happened previously, but we cannot expect to do that while the Competition Authority and the companies organisation are understaffed.  The Minister inherited that problem but we should know what is needed by now with the amount of sheer blackguarding that went on and the number of rogue companies and businesses that went off and did not pay anybody.  Senator Feargal Quinn's Construction Contracts Bill is still foundering in that efforts are still being made to bring it in to protect the many subcontractors.  I raised that issue here two and half or three years ago, the morning a big company in this city went bust and left more than 600 subcontractors stranded.  We must remember that a subcontractor is not an item; he or she is normally a sole trade or the owner of a small company with a number of employees, who all have families.  There is a huge human cost involved.  Subcontractors all have workers, as Deputy Halligan said, and responsibilities.  The way that legislation has been flouted is not good enough.  </p><p> The new Companies Bill has some significant reforms and I will not say that it has not.  The new LTD company, as it is termed, can have a minimum of one member and up to a maximum of 149 members.  I welcome that, because there are people who want to set up in business.  They have great ideas and enthusiasm.  Our young people have the drive, passion, qualifications and energy to create businesses and they have amazing new ideas and technologies of which we would never have thought.  I salute the many entrepreneurs, whether they be sole traders, farmers, shopkeepers or hairdressers, or, on the construction side, the small builder, the sole trader or the people with trades who set up their own business and have done tremendous work.  However, their businesses have been hammered and decimated in the past two or three years.   They need some protection, and I welcome that part of the legislation.</p><p> For the first time, guaranteed companies will be able to avail of the audit exemption.  This innovation will be of significant benefit to the sectors that tend to use the guaranteed company structure, such as companies in the voluntary sector - I am involved in many of those - voluntary sector charities and residential management companies, while at the same time recognising the particular circumstances applying to guaranteed companies in allowing a single member to object.  That is very important as there must be provision for one member to object.</p><p> This Bill is long overdue.  Previous speakers have been complimentary about the people in the company law review group for the hard work they have done.  That is great and I am delighted about that, and I know they engaged in public consultation, but we have to make it easier to do business.  In terms of the figures available, we rank 15th in the world for ease of doing business.  I would not have thought that was the case.  If we are 15th in the world, that is wonderful, but I do not believe it is the case.  Deputy Coffey, who is in the Chair, might not like to hear the figure I have seen quoted by his former employer, which is that we are 95th in terms of access to electricity and power.  That was not the fault of Deputy Coffey or his colleagues.  They were the people on the ground who were doing their best, but again, bureaucracy and monopolies came into play, and that is never good.</p><p> Up to 90% of businesses are in the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector and they rely hugely on the goodwill of their families, their staff and many of the agencies with which they deal.  All of them have been hit with the tsunami of the banking crisis.  Many of them did not get into huge debt and had limited overdrafts.  They had built up those overdrafts and worked hard to get recognition from the bank manager and bank personnel who knew them to secure those facilities but, unfortunately, that all counts for naught now, as they cannot avail of any type of credit.  Many of them who have overdrafts get phone calls on a daily or weekly basis asking them to come into the bank for a chat.  When they go in they find out that their overdraft, which they had built up over the years because of their good record with the bank, is the problem.  They paid back all the loans they got but they are now being asked to halve the money they got from the bank or the bank will have to take it from them or offer them a term loan instead.  People have little choice in that regard because all the negotiation is being done in one direction.  They come out of the bank with a term loan under their belt, so to speak.</p><p> To add insult to injury, I believe the banks are accumulating all arrangements in such cases and presenting them to the Minister who is present and the Minister for Finance and his officials as new lending.  It is a farce.  It is a con job.  I know that, and the Minister and everybody else knows it.  That is unfair.  Deputy Coffey would know about that.  Deputy Fleming knows there is a huge crisis in agriculture that is not recognised by Government or anybody.  It arose because of inclement weather, with a bad summer, a long winter and a very difficult spring.  I was surprised and delighted to hear the Minister's ministerial colleague, Deputy Coveney, say that the banks were ready and waiting for farmers to go in to them, but that is not true.  Even if they take off the Wellingtons and wear their best suits to go in to the banks they will not get past the counter.  They will be told they have no credit rating because they cannot sell their stock; the stock they currently have are unfit to be sold.  I do not want to digress from the Bill, but that is a symptom of what is going on in the banks.  The farmers are not getting money, and where they have got money to buy meal and forage the banks are screaming at them to give it back, but they cannot give it back.  I salute some of the co-operative companies - Dairygold and others - that have recognised this and the co-operatives that have looked after farmers.  We are in the midst of a huge crisis that is across the board as regards finance.  </p><p> I would have thought a lack of finance was the biggest problem facing people but, having listened to previous speakers and noted what was in the report published last week, I have heard that while there is a lack of finance, the ordinary people - the punter, the man in the shop, the housewife, the husband or whoever - do not have money to spend.  Austerity is not working.  The IMF has recognised that.  The biggest problem for companies is to try to keep their doors open and pay the rates, rents and staff while their shops are empty.  They will be empty if a further &euro;300 million is taken from the public service and not from many other areas, so that we will not have to deal with the elephant in the room, which is banking.  We will have to examine the monopolies in our country.  I might mention CRH, which is a huge monopoly.  I meet those in companies that are being put out of business on a daily basis.  The Competition Authority is toothless, or else it has gone to the dentist and got all its teeth pulled and has only bad dentures, because it is toothless and ineffective.</p><p>It does not have the staff, the wherewithal or the power to tackle big business which is crucifying small to medium-sized businesses.  There is a huge cartel in that industry which needs to be blown asunder because there is too much appalling misery in small companies, by which I mean those employing up to 100 people, and sole traders.  There is a monopoly in this and other areas of the economy, which I am sure the Minister sees every day of the week when he meets business people.  We must get around this and have to be able to support small businesses.</p><p> The winding-up process costs &euro;10,000, which is a lot of money.  Small businesses, sole traders, farmers and subcontractors have to be protected.  I do not know where they will find solace in this Bill, although it has still to be debated on Committee Stage.  I do not know how they will read and understand it or how changes can be made that will suit them.  The legal costs of examinerships are prohibitive for companies.  In many cases. however, examinerships have worked.  Some have failed, but they are a half-way house.  More must be done in the Bill to curtail the newest industry in the country - receivership, which is an abomination.  I do not see any change in this document to the Supreme Court ruling that a company director cannot stand in court without having a barrister or solicitor.  People cannot afford solicitors and barristers who do not come cheap.  They must, if they are able, be allowed to represent themselves in court.  They will speak under oath and should be entitled to do so.  That is a big shortcoming of this legislation.  I hope to submit amendments on that issue because this is wrong.  There has been an outrageous explosion of smash and grab receiverships.  Some of the big companies involved in receiverships are the ones that did the accounts some years ago for the companies in receivership.  It would make one dizzy.  We are on a spinning top, spinning around.  The Minister knows who and what I am talking about.</p><p> Is there anything in this document to deal with sheriffs?  It is an outdated title, but they are stalking the land at a ferocious pace.  There does not seem to be any clarity or proper legislation for them.  Are they legal at all?  Most of the documents they bring when they come to people's homes which they cannot enter without permission are not even stamped.  I have tried to find out for myself, but will the Minister check if sheriffs operate legally?  I salute the county coroner in Tipperary.  Some time ago a sheriff visited a small business man in his shop at 1 p.m. to demand money with menaces and at 2 p.m. a customer found the man dead in the shop.  At the inquest the county coroner for Tipperary and Laois described it as State terrorism.  That is what it was.  There is State terrorism up and down the country.  Sheriffs and agents are making agreements with people, writing them down, signing them and tearing them up next day.  There is no good will.  This issue must be dealt with.  We cannot deal with ordinary people and make them pay if we cannot deal with State terrorism.  That State terrorism has increased and grown legs and ordinary people, including company directors, managers, sole traders, farmers and others, are living in fear and dread of the people concerned who think they are mighty and right all of the time.  If companies are not allowed to challenge them in court without legal representation, they will go nowhere.</p><p> I do not see anything in the Bill to tackle that problem or empower the Competition Authority and other such bodies.  There are only seven or eight people in the Competition Authority and very few investigating officers.  All of the power is on one side, terrorising families and small businesses.  Unfortunately, garda&iacute; are accompanying sheriffs.  Garda&iacute; think everything is legal because there is a sheriff and that he or she is acting on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, a bank or whatever else, but a lot of the documents they have are not worth the paper in the bathrooms here.  They are only made up and not stamped. </p><p> Are the banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and others, legal entities?  I do not think they are.  We have many banks selling their loan books and everything else to other companies.  If I have a lease agreement with or a loan from the Minister, it is with him or his company, but he can sell it on to somebody else who writes menacing letters to me looking for the money.  That is wrong, illegal and would not stand up anywhere.  This is happening wholesale.  There have been buy-outs and sell-outs of loan books and everything else.  It is a complete and utter racket, almost equal to what is happening with receivers.  At the rate the receivers charge per hour, they have a licence to print money.  When they go into a company, they plunder it.</p><p> Examinership is a fairer system, which is why we must preserve and protect it.  The examiner looks at a company with a view to saving it and keeping the workers employed.  I would say 90% of receivers are out to rape businesses and they make a fortune out of it.  That is totally wrong and disgusting, especially when some of the companies involved were advisers to Anglo Irish Bank, the IBRC.  Now they are receivers.  The workers who were in the former Anglo Irish Bank, the IBRC, to help the receivers obtain the loans back from people who should not have borrowed and did not repay the loans are expected to have goodwill, yet they are being treated with disdain, not receiving the redundancy package that was promised.  It would be only a small sum of money in the overall scheme of things.</p><p> While I welcome this document, it is too long and unwieldy.  We all know from attending meetings around the country as part of our job that any meeting that continues for three or four hours loses its impact.  The same is true of any document that runs to 1,300 or 1,400 pages in its short version.  Will it do what it is expected to do?  Perhaps the Minister should read it again.  He could bring it in stage by stage.  It has to deal with the problems I have mentioned and if it does not, it is not worth the paper it is written on.  I know it costs money to print, but if it costs the ordinary layman in the street or an ordinary employee or company director &euro;109, that is prohibitive and will put them off.  They could buy ten novels or thrillers for that price.  The Minister knows what are the real problems in our society.  I did not even mention the development companies which are being subsumed into the county councils which are not pro-business and never were; they are regulating agencies.  The county enterprise boards are being subsumed into Enterprise Ireland.  I have the height of respect for the boards, particularly the one in south Tipperary and its staff, as well as for the development companies.</p></speech>

We have a clear picture now of a Minister who talks a good game but fails to deliver on the big occasions. </p><p>  In the 2012 budget he told us he would secure &euro;75 million in savings in 2012 and &euro;150 million in savings in respect of allowances by the end of 2013.  At the time, I recognised the current system was unnecessarily cumbersome and was in need of being streamlined.  However, the process put in place failed to achieve the targets set.  In fact, by October of last year, the Minister had to admit the savings he had achieved to date would only be a fraction of his original targeted amount.</p><p>  The Minister must bear the lion's share of responsibility for the outcome of last week's vote.  His words certainly did no favours to those unions which were attempting to sell the deal to their members.  In his article on 5 April in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, he upped the ante considerably in a manner that may have been a significant contributing factor.  It is worth reminding the Minister what he said:<blockquote>In the absence of these measures, a straight pay cut would require a greater ask to reach the same target.  Public servants, that under this agreement face a gross reduction in pay of, say 4%, could potentially see that increase to 7% in the absence of an agreement.  The &euro;300 million savings to the pay bill are in this year's budgetary arithmetic.  Those savings will have to be made from the pay bill - the money simply is not provided for.  Similarly, the &euro;1 billion savings will have to be achieved by 2015.<br /><br /><br />  If they cannot be made within the confines of an agreement with the public service unions, they will have to be made unilaterally.  This will require legislation.  The precise nature of that legislation will be considered if that eventuality arises.</blockquote>  I have seen the Minister's performance in the run-up to the Croke Park II vote described as swashbuckling in some quarters.  If that is the case, his appearance on last Tuesday night's &#8220;Six One News&#8221; can only be described as extraordinarily meek by comparison.  He looked somewhat shell shocked as he told the nation, &#8220;I will be taking a phone call from the troika tonight to explain what happened.&quot;  It is extraordinary to find that the Labour Party, once so closely aligned with the trade union movement, now appears to be so out of touch with public sector workers.  He went on the claim that he would run out of money before the end of the year if &euro;300 million in savings were not achieved.  This is despite the fact that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, currently has &euro;30 billion in cash.  I am not recommending he dips into those reserves but it is extraordinary to claim the State will run out of money when it has such reserves.  The statements are mutually contradictory.</p><p>  What we have not seen from the Minister as yet is any serious analysis of why the deal was rejected or what can be done to rescue the situation to prevent it descending into the same level of farce to which the review of allowances last year descended.  The unions opposed to Croke Park II launched an equality audit of the proposals which focused on the impact of changes in working conditions.  These issues did not receive as much attention as the pay-cut elements of Croke Park II but I believe they were the decisive factor in the rejection of the agreement.  Among the issues the audit highlighted was that the provision for additional hours would have a considerable negative impact of people with caring responsibilities be it for children or parents.  In worst-case scenarios, this could force carers out of the workplace or put significant additional financial burdens on them.  Restrictions on job sharing and flexitime are also likely to have been a considerable factor in the heavy defeat which the proposals suffered.  When the draft agreement was published by the Labour Relations Commission, I met young mothers working in the public sector in Portlaoise who were crying at having to work extra hours and spend much less time with their families.  Work-life balance was a significant factor.   The audit stated:<blockquote>These proposals discriminate on the family status ground because they will disproportionately disadvantage men and women with caring responsibilities in the public sector - the Employment Equality Acts prohibit direct and indirect discrimination on a number of grounds including gender and family status.  It could further be a matter for the European Commission to adjudicate on, given the provisions of the equal treatment directives on the ground of gender.</blockquote>  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the Government's proposals was the very harsh impact they would have had on front-line and shift workers.  Everyone understands the critical nature of the services they provide, yet the Government felt it was acceptable to target them for a disproportionate slice of the overall savings for which they were looking.  Two different workers with the same current take-home pay would have seen vastly different changes in their income depending on the extent to which they work shift and overtime.  The 24/7 Alliance produced detailed analysis of the loss that would be suffered by different categories of workers.  In the case of a staff nurse, the reduction in earnings allowing for the theoretical cost of having to work additional hours and the increment freeze is approximately 11.4% of pre-agreement total pay.  For a paramedic, the effective loss would be 9.7% and 9.1% for a care assistant.  For a Garda it would be 5%.  I know the Minister will dispute these figures.  However, he disputes the number of Sundays worked by some categories of public workers saying it is fewer than 26.  He also played a little bit of fun and games with the statistics by talking about the average pay cut.  Included in this figure by the Minister are those who will not get a pay cut at all.  That means he is trying to reduce the overall average, notwithstanding some people would have a disproportionate higher cut than the average.</p><p>  These represented a massive additional hit to workers who have already contributed very significantly to reducing the public sector pay bill.  We did not get a clear rationale from the Minister as to why he was proceeding in this way.  In fact, what we did get was black propaganda as he publicly stated those unions who had remained in the talks had been able to get a better deal for their members while his officials briefed about a supposed &euro;300 million pot of gold which would be available to sweeten the deal for those unions who supported it.</p><p>  We believe it is imperative the Government urgently engages with public sector unions to seek an agreed approach to public sector pay.  The absence of widespread industrial unrest has marked Ireland apart from other countries.  The Government's approach has put this at risk.  We believe it is possible to conclude an agreement which achieves the necessary savings while achieving fairness and social solidarity.</p><p>  I welcome the announcement that the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission has been asked to make contact with the parties in the coming days to establish if there is a basis for a negotiated agreement.  I hope tonight's motion has had the effect of galvanising the Minister into action.</p><p>  Unfortunately, since the rejection of the agreement, his words have spread further confusion.  Last week, when I asked the Minister what actions he now proposed to take, he indicated that most of those who would have been subject to pay cuts under the agreement would have seen their salaries restored after 2016.  However, for those workers who were being asked to work longer hours, see reductions in overtime payments or the abolition of the double pay rate on a Sunday, no such assurance was forthcoming.  This is symptomatic of what can only be described as a divide-and-conquer strategy.  Last week, he claimed those earning over &euro;65,000 will only have to take a temporary pay cut and will have their salaries returned at the end of the agreement.</p><p>However, the Minister has given no such commitment to those people who work on Sundays and nor did he give a commitment to the people being asked to work additional hours, most of whom are on low pay, that those extra hours worked would be of a temporary nature.  Instead, he looked after the high paid workers by telling them they would have to take a cut but it would be restored to them in 2016.  That is my understanding of what the Minister said here last week.</p><p> I accept the need for reform and modernisation in the public service.  The Croke Park model is still the best one to achieve that and we support the principles that underpin it.  If a new agreement is to be negotiated and put to public sector workers, it cannot be voted on in the absence of full disclosure of all relevant facts to all parties.  By that I mean the various letters issued to individual trade unions by the Minister's Department, public sector management and the Labour Relations Commission.  We are aware of at least ten letters having been issued shortly after the deal was negotiated, and I understand further clarification would have issued later.  I asked the Minister to disclose those and he refused to do so, stating that it is not the normal practice.  The Minister has regularly stated that he is in favour of freedom of information, yet he is hiding behind the old practice of not disclosing matters that are part of the labour conciliation process.  This is the first time a deal has been voted down in terms of pay agreements at national level and the circumstances require all correspondence regarding that deal to be published.  How can the Minister expect the Parliament to move forward with legislation if he is concealing facts as to the clarifications and implications of that deal?</p><p> Further savings are needed, and an agreed framework is the best way to bring that about.  It is worth noting that the vast majority of savings achieved to date have been from measures introduced by the previous Government.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, claimed that, &quot;A totality of &euro;2 billion has been taken out of the public sector pay and pension bill as a result of the measures since 2008 and the measures that Brendan Howlin is introducing now&quot;.  However, the reality is that the Government has not up to now introduced any significant measures to control the public sector pay bill.</p><p> The claim of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that the Croke Park agreement was &quot;an extraordinary tool for change&quot; and that most of his European Union colleagues would give their right arm to have such an agreement rings hollow given his ham-fisted approach to the recent talks and their aftermath.  The country wants and expects good public services.  Good industrial relations and a shared commitment to reform are a cornerstone of the delivery of such services.  The Government must learn the lessons of its failure to deliver this agreement.  It must be open to hearing what public sector workers have to say and respond in a transparent manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="21:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300047#UU00200"><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il motion before the House takes stock of where we are now, reflects on the errors made and clearly recognises the need to achieve the savings required in a fairer way.</p><p>  The fact that the Government has today decided to move part of the way along the road suggested by our motion and by our party spokesperson by asking the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission to make contact with the parties in the coming days is a welcome development and a recognition of what our party spokesperson on public expenditure, Deputy Sean Fleming, has been saying since the announcement of the vote last week.  The only way to begin to undo the damage caused by the &quot;No&quot; vote is to go back to negotiations, treat all public servants equally and respect their goodwill towards the process.</p><p>  With our party spokesperson, Deputy Fleming, I welcome that the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Mulvey, has been asked to intercede, but his involvement will only bear fruit if the root causes of the rejection of the Croke Park II deal are fully recognised.  Our motion seeks to achieve this as it outlines clearly the issues, the challenges and the need to progress beyond the current impasse.  </p><p>  The serious and difficult position triggered by the &quot;No&quot; vote is of the Government's own making.  It could have been averted if the Government had taken wiser counsel and adopted a less confrontational strategy in the first place.  The scale and impact of what has happened is significant.  Last week's rejection of the Croke Park II proposals was the first time in over a quarter of a century that trade unionists have rejected a national agreement.  </p><p>  What could have brought them to discontinue the long-standing practice of industrial harmony in this country that was beneficial to all?  As set out in this Private Members' motion, it was a combination of issues.  First, no sooner had Fine Gael and Labour Ministers taken up their portfolios than a large number of them were undermining the contribution of the public service while spinning behind the scenes about perks and privileges.  </p><p>  Second, most of those Ministers ignored the progress and savings achieved under the original Croke Park agreement.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is exempt from that criticism as well.  I remember a comment he made that was fulsome in regard to the Croke Park deal.  Third, the Government adopted a divide and conquer approach that targeted public sector workers on the front line, leaving them to bear a disproportionate burden.  All of us in our every day work, and people in society in general, recognise that many of those front-line staff are in the most challenging and demanding sectors of the public service.  They are the people we rely on 24 hours a day, seven days a week to deliver services for us in many difficult circumstances.  That was coupled with leaked details of an unspecified honey pot that would be available to sweeten the deal for unspecified sectors of the public service.</p><p>  Fourth, when it became clear that points one to three were not working, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Government produced the big stick of a 7% across the board pay cut that would be pushed through the Oireachtas if workers did not support his proposals.</p><p>  Nowhere in this strategy did we see the fairness and equality that was needed to win the support of the public service in general.  Deputy Fleming, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, repeatedly called for full disclosure of all side offers but those particular details were not forthcoming from the Department or the Minister.  That full disclosure is an essential first step if the Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform are to have any chance of restoring good faith with the public sector.  So, too, is acknowledging the basic unfairness in some elements of the deal put forward so far.</p><p>  It is difficult to figure out the reason the Government and its supporters, at various levels of public representation and in unions, could have urged and advocated acceptance of a deal that impacted negatively on women and family life.  It should never have allowed a deal where two people on the same income according to their payslip would have seen a considerably different impact on their take-home pay depending on how it is made up between core pay and overtime.</p><p>  The Labour Party's hard-ball, divide and conquer approach to the Croke Park II deal contrasts with its near silence on the Croke Park I deal.  We will recall that in the autumn of 2010 the then Deputy Eamon Gilmore, as leader of the Labour Party in opposition, was singing a different tune.  At that time he felt that union members should be left in peace to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the agreement and make their decision accordingly.  A few months before that he was telling the Labour Party conference he wanted a government that would &quot;change the way the system works and be prepared to change the system if necessary&quot;.  It is now April 2013 and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, and his Ministers are cajoling and warning workers to accept the deal or take a 7% across the board cut.  It seems that rather than Labour changing the system, the system has changed Labour.</p><p>  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is one of the fairest members of the Government, to ensure that every effort is made to bring about an agreement.  It is necessary that the Government engages fully and urgently with public sector unions and seeks an agreed approach to public sector pay.  From 1987 until now we have had industrial peace in this country that is for the benefit of all our citizens.  I believe it is possible to reach an agreement that achieves the necessary savings while at the same time ensures fairness and social solidarity.</p></speech>

Over the past 26 years the social and industrial partnership relationship has brought a huge dividend and we have had industrial peace around the table.  Irrespective of the partnership's shortcomings, the long-term goal for the nation is to retain social partnership and ensure any agreements are negotiated.  That is the right way to go forward politically.  We must acknowledge the huge sacrifices that have been made by the public service.  While there is an ongoing debate in the context of the public versus the private sector and the pros and cons of both sides, those who work in the public sector have made a huge contribution to Irish society.</p><p>  When we speak about foreign direct investment, one of the first points made is that we have an educated young workforce available.  Our education system, developed over the decades since the foundation of the State, has led us to a situation where we have a high standard of education for our young people.  People who work in the education sector, school teachers, principals and those in the third level sector, have contributed and invested much of their life and work in creating an education system of which we can be proud.  It is very easy to say one section of these workers is cleaning out the system and that there is another building it.  However, when we look at the strengths of our system and society which have been developed over the years, we must acknowledge that the people working in the public service have contributed enormously.</p><p>  Since the crash in 2008, people in the public sector have made sacrifices in the form of the pension levy and pay cuts.  These people are good, conscientious citizens who work hard and believe it is their social responsibility to do what they can to ensure Irish society develops in a positive way and they are willing to make sacrifices to achieve this.  There are always some who say the sector is willing to pay, but not us.  However, by and large the public sector has contributed and made huge sacrifices.  In the areas of innovation and expertise within the public sector and State services, such as in Forf&aacute;s and training authorities, there has been ingenuity with regard to contributing to savings.  This must be acknowledged.</p><p>  We all remember the negotiations for Croke Park I and remember that some people behind the scenes were critical of those negotiations and agitated against them, but the deal worked and we tried to move forward with Croke Park II.  I feel the failure of the negotiations had to do with the language used in handling them.  All of society is vulnerable currently, and negotiations relating to pay cuts and conditions need to be framed in language that will bring people with us.  Just as in 1987, when the first model for social partnership was introduced, an initiative that was also being developed elsewhere and which was introduced here successfully, it is vital the language used is moderate, considered and appropriate.  The media always wants to find an angle on partnership, but that leads us to a tangent to which we do not want to take those working in State services.</p><p>  In many instances, the morale of people working in State services is on the floor and what we need to be able to do is to bring those people with us, because they have the greater good of Irish society in their hearts and minds as they go to work each day.  We must also be conscious of those people who work in our front line services.  These people risk their lives for citizens on a daily basis and they must be recognised in a special way.  However, the language that was being used in the context of &quot;sweetheart deals&quot;, whether these deals were real or imaginary, inflamed the emotions of ordinary, decent public sector workers.  Statements were being made with regard to what would be done in 2016 and elsewhere, rather than what would happen in the here and now.  </p><p>  I welcome the initiative to bring both sides together now under the auspices of the Labour Relations Council to see whether there is any middle ground or whether any initiative can be introduced in regard to partnership, because it is the only way forward.  The only way forward is to have an agreed solution.  We need industrial peace in the country.  We face significant challenges throughout the country on a raft of issues and the last thing we need is for a disagreement to open up which could have been avoided if moderate language had been used, if consideration had been given to the people involved and if respect had been shown to those at the coal face, whether people in the public service from nine to five, those on weekend work, those working 24/7 or those in our health service, justice or school systems.  All of these people deserve and need our respect because they do a hugely important job for the State.</p><p>  I commend the motion drafted by Deputy Sean Fleming to the House.  It is a considered and calm motion which highlights that we believe industrial peace is vital for well-being and security of the State.</p></speech>

This is a difficult and traumatic time to try to negotiate an agreement that will be acceptable to all.  Last Saturday I met with retired psychiatric nurses who outlined for me their position and what they feel about what has happened.  We can only squeeze so much out of people.  As the Minister knows, I respect his position and I appreciate that he is dealing with a poisoned chalice and is trying to do the impossible.  However, at the end of the day it is all about fairness.  Deputy Moynihan was correct when he stated this is a considered and calm motion, not a motion that picks politically at the Government.  The motion has been well thought out and tries to bring about a situation where a mutual agreement can be found that will be acceptable to all.</p><p>  I have attended many meetings of the 24/7 group, who rightfully feel they have been targeted enough in the past.  Retired people also feel they have been targeted enough already.  All of these people are struggling daily with their budgets and that is the situation.  Take, for example, a young garda who borrowed money for a mortgage during the height of the boom.  He now finds himself in an impossible situation where he is paying a mortgage for a house that cost &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 but which is worth only &euro;120,000 and he has a young wife and kids.  Other people were trying to better themselves.  They had been doing well in the public service and they borrowed money on the strength of that.</p><p>Nobody can blame anybody for trying to better themselves.  I would certainly support every person who ever tried to do that.  Having got caught when the investments they made went wrong, they are now relying on their jobs to assist them with their payments.  One cannot blame them for being angry when the money from their jobs is being cut.</p><p> I agree that a terribly difficult balancing or juggling act has to be performed.  That is why I thank Fianna F&aacute;il from the bottom of my heart for bringing this motion before the House.  It is right, proper and prudent that this matter is debated in a cool and thoughtful manner.  Deputies on all sides of the House should get to make their contributions.  We have to try to achieve what needs to be achieved in a fair way that is acceptable to all.  I agree with the part of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion that calls on the Government not to rush to &quot;legislate for an across the board 7 per cent cut&quot; in the manner that was suggested in this House by the Taoiseach and two or three Ministers.  I do not think it would be right to rush into anything like that.  I genuinely do not think it would be fair or proper.</p><p> At all times, we have to think of the young families, the middle-aged people and the people who are facing retirement.  Last week, I met a deputation of retired psychiatric nurses who made a great case when arguing that they could not bear any further cuts in their pensions.  The Government must listen to all of those arguments and take them on board in trying to achieve an agreement that is fair and equitable for all.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il again for proposing this motion.  I hope everybody who wants to make a contribution will get an opportunity to do so tonight and tomorrow night.  I am grateful to the Minister for being here to listen to our viewpoints.  I know he takes his job seriously and earnestly.  It would be a mean person who would not stand up here and acknowledge that he is doing his best in difficult circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="21:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300049#WW00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which is timely in light of what happened last week.  It is fair, rational and well thought-out.  It underpins something that is critically important in the overall context of public sector reform.  Real reform should involve more than paying reduced salaries to public and civil servants.  The only way for real reform to come about is by means of engagement.  It is clear that the carrot and stick approach, which almost involved threatening and intimidatory behaviour towards the end when it was suggested that the pay of public servants would be cut by 7% across the board if the deal was not accepted, was not helpful at the best of times.</p><p>  Social partnership has served this country well.  I think most political parties support it.  Obviously, Fine Gael is quite happy that it has fallen at this juncture.  It was never ideologically, emotionally or politically attached to it.  At a time when this nation is still vulnerable and is trying to restore confidence internally, domestically and internationally, industrial unrest is the last thing we need.  I hope the skills of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, more importantly - I do not mean any disrespect when I say this - the State industrial relations apparatus, including the Labour Relations Commission, are used to find a way through this impasse when those involved sit down together.</p><p>  I cannot claim to have an indepth knowledge of the internal workings of a union like the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and others have.  However, my impression is that this proposal was rejected because there was a perception that lower-paid workers, front-line workers and those who carry out a great part of public duties as they deliver services were being unfairly targeted.  That might be an unfair perception, but that is certainly how it seemed to an outsider looking in.  For all those reasons, it is important for us to acknowledge that nurses, garda&iacute; and others who deliver front-line services on a daily basis would have been most unfairly affected by these proposals.  The Minister was right when he said the core pay of people under a certain level was being protected, but he should accept that the vast majority of people who do shift work, who provide front-line services and who work outside the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. would have been unfairly affected if these proposals had been accepted.  That has to be acknowledged when the negotiating table is revisited.</p><p>  I suppose the area in which I have the most interaction with unions at this juncture is the health care sector, as my party's spokesperson on health.  There was a genuine concern that the graduate scheme which was announced last year would undermine the nursing profession by requiring some of our highly qualified, motivated and committed nurses to start working on lesser pay than their peers with the same responsibilities.  Such schemes genuinely undermine our workers.</p><p>  I understand the difficulties the Minister is facing.  I recall the difficulties we faced when we were in government.  The Minister and his colleagues might not have acknowledged them in the same way when they were in opposition.  Perhaps they exploited them.  We can put that aside.  The key issue is whether these people feel they are valued by the State.  The best way to reward them is to accept the important role they play in the delivery of public services.  I think that role has been undermined.  I have previously made the point that it is inherently unfair to ask a generation of people who are now coming out of college - they were in primary or secondary school when certain decisions were made, supported and encouraged - to carry the can for the difficulties we presently face.  I accept that we started it to some extent.  It is intergenerational solidarity in reverse.  We are asking those who are coming out of college to accept being paid less for something they had no hand, act or part in.  They did not even vote in the relevant general elections.</p><p>  To be quite blunt about it, I do not think this matter has been handled in a wonderfully diplomatic way.  I expected more from the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  I would have expected other members of the Cabinet, who will remain nameless, to have handled it in a ham-fisted way.  In light of his background and his membership of the Labour Party, I expected the Minister to have a more intimate knowledge of the workings of the trade union movement.  Any renegotiations should be based on parity and fairness.  The Government should not ask people who were kids in secondary school or college when certain decisions were made, and who may never have voted, to carry a disproportionate burden as the State tries to address the difficulties in its public finances.  That is something that should be acknowledged.</p><p>  I find that Irish people are inherently decent and fair.  When union members were asked to vote for this proposal, in effect they were asked to rubber-stamp the imposition of an unfair burden on those who provide front-line services and those who have just joined the public service or are about to do so.  The unfairness of the proposals that were presented should be acknowledged when the Labour Relations Commission, the Government and others enter into overarching negotiations.  If the Government removes the threat, that will represent a signal that it values public services, particularly front-line services.</p></speech>

On two occasions, Deputy Martin's Government cut the pay of public servants unilaterally - no negotiations, no votes, just cut.</p><p>  There is no doubt, and I say this honestly, that I would prefer to be standing in front of this House this evening defending the outcome of a negotiated process and the need to implement the LRC proposals to reduce the cost of the public service pay and pension bill by &euro;1 billion over the next three years.  That was not to be.  I do not doubt, though, that if it had been passed, there would be many opposite who would be opposing me, although not necessarily some of those who spoke earlier, who actually have an understanding of these matters.  However, I still believe that the LRC proposals were fair and balanced, and, in particular, fair and balanced to the public servants involved.  They protected core pay and allowances where those allowances were part of core pay.  I have spent two years defending the Croke Park Agreement.  I have spent two years explaining why, in many instances, allowances are part of core pay.</p><p>  In terms of the comments just made on intergenerational solidarity, one of the core objectives of this set of proposals was to end the disparity that had developed in recent years in that regard.  The proposals segmented the workforce into four income categories and treated each differently.  Those earning in excess of &euro;100,000 would suffer permanent losses in pay.  Those between &euro;65,000 and &euro;100,000 were afforded a path to pay restoration following the expiry of the agreement.  Those under &euro;65,000 suffered no loss in core pay.  In the zero to &euro;35,000 and &euro;35,000 to &euro;65,000 categories, the treatment of increments was similarly progressive.  Central to the agreement was a series of productivity measures which reduced the need for cash savings.  This was a complex deal, much more complex than Croke Park I because it strove so hard to be fair and balanced.  The negotiators, particularly from the trade unions, worked hard to achieve that balance.</p><p>  The proposals were also, I believe, fair to the taxpayer.  We have not heard much about the taxpayer in this debate so far - in fact, I do not believe the taxpayer was mentioned by any of the Deputies opposite.  The taxpayer is entitled to have public services that reflect the 24-7 nature of the modern world.  I regard that as important as ensuring that the public service reflects best practice in the treatment of its workforce.  The proposals also made good on a strong desire of mine to replace the two-tier pay scales introduced by Deputy Martin's Government, the very point that was just referred to opposite.</p><p>  Let me put it on record that I accept the decision of public servants in the ballot.  I do not believe this decision constitutes a rejection of collective agreements by them but, in the absence of an alternative agreement, that is the space we now find ourselves in.  I have heard some teacher unions' representatives defend their move towards strike ballots by claiming they are not the &quot;aggressors&quot;.  I find the language strange.  There are no aggressors here, merely a Government seeking to make good the huge hole in the public finances caused by Deputy Martin's party.  This issue arises solely because of the place we, as a people, collectively find ourselves in.  The public finances - or in normal parlance, the employer - remain in a perilous position.  Were this the private sector, there would talk of job losses and jobs would be on the line.</p><p>  I was concerned about some of the information imparted during the ballot process and felt it necessary to make some statements during the debate.  Deputy Fleming and others have sought to make some noise about those comments, and we have heard them again tonight.  Why this is so in Deputy Fleming's case, I am not sure, because his only point of substance was to demand &euro;50 million more in savings this year - that was his contribution on the politics programme on the Sunday before the ballot was announced.  Nor is there any evidence that he read what I said, although he did accurately quote it tonight, finally.</p><p>  My message was a simple one.  The savings required were and are real, and in the absence of the desired agreement to pursue them in a negotiated fashion, they would still have to be made and there is no escaping that.  That remains my position.  It was for clarity on this issue, so people would make very difficult and momentous decisions that affected themselves and their families while knowing the full facts, that I made the statements I made, with a rigorous appraisal of the State's finances and laying out the quantum of savings I genuinely believe are required from pay and pensions.  Some of those who left the talks on the eve of the agreement had been aware of scale of the challenge for well over a month at that stage.</p><p>  Listening to some union leaders commenting since the vote, it seems there is now a groundswell against austerity.  Austerity is a nice phrase to hang your hat on, so let us deal with that one.  I am not a believer in austerity.  I believe in a more coherent anti-austerity strategy across Europe, which would be a good idea not only for Ireland but for all of Europe.  If President Barroso needs an ally in this regard, given the comments he made yesterday, he certainly has one here, in me.  The key threat to Ireland successfully exiting its programme of assistance is the economic environment in Europe itself.  I am not a dreamer either, however.  I have been in politics long enough to know the damage done to a small country like ours by not being able to pay its way.  Burgeoning deficits in the 1970s - Fianna F&aacute;il again of course - undermined our viability and led to the inevitability of an imbalance in our books.  As we found out then, who will invest in a country in a permanent sense of crisis?  We dragged on that recession unnecessarily because we did not take the necessary corrective action early enough, which is the fault of all parties.</p><p>  This State is pursuing anti-austerity policies by any definition.  We continue to run up a sizeable budget deficit each year despite our enormous debt burden.  The size of the budget deficit is being reduced in a steady and rational fashion.  The Government has already added a further year to that timetable by negotiation with the troika, but the idea that we can push that debt burden higher and higher on a permanent basis defies reason and mortgages the future for the next generation of Irish citizens.</p><p>  I know the measures the Government has to take are unpleasant.  God knows I do not want to be the bearer of bad news.  I wish I was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in good times rather than the most awful times in our history.  These measures are difficult for people to accept, and I understand that, but this will be the final push to secure the exit from Deputy Martin's troika programme.</p><p>  On a side issue, Deputy Fleming is much taken with the idea that letters of clarification issued during this process.  I find his fascination with the issue to be strange.  He seems unfamiliar with the normal practice of industrial relations, at least as practised by his own party.  There are numerous letters of clarification in existence in regard to the original Croke Park deal negotiated by his Government.</p><p>  Today, the Government had an initial discussion on the implications of the rejection of the proposals of the LRC.  In line with our overall approach, which is that we much prefer to achieve the reductions that are needed in pay and pensions by way of negotiation rather than by unilateral expropriation, the Government decided to ask Mr. Kieran Mulvey of the LRC, who facilitated the talks process in January and February, to make contact with the parties to see whether there is a basis for a further engagement that might lead to an agreement.</p><p>He will do that exploration over the coming days with both sides and report in time to allow for a further discussion and decision by the Government.  I do not want to put a timeframe on his work but we estimate it will be about a fortnight.  The Government is certainly willing to talk to staff representatives who are prepared to reach a realistic compromise with the Government on how to make these demonstrably needed savings.  The reality of the budgetary timetable is such that time for any discussions is running out.  I hope this satisfies Deputy Fleming.  It certainly meets his dual requirement of holding open the door to a negotiated solution while remaining clear about the scale of the fiscal challenge to be met, although, as I pointed out earlier, he wants to make deeper cuts this year.</p><p> Indeed, looking at Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget material from last year, one can see a sense of <i>faux</i>outrage at the Government's strategy that is manifest in tonight's motion.  It is no harm reminding the House of Deputy Fleming's commitments made less than six months ago on this talks process.  This is what the Fianna F&aacute;il pre-budget proposal said.  It was the published, official position of Fianna F&aacute;il for this year's budget:<blockquote>We believe the pay and pensions bill is not falling fast enough and an additional &euro;350m needs to be achieved in 2013.  However, should agreement with the unions not be reached by March 1st 2013, the Government will have to consider a range of measures to achieve this additional level of savings including: a reduction in the sick leave, including uncertified sick leave bill of &euro;50m; an average cut of 5% in actual allowances to save &euro;75m; deferral of increments for 2013 to save &euro;170m, with no increments payable above &euro;100,000; accelerated targeted redundancy in administrative and management grade numbers to save &euro;30m; additional working hours and a change to work practices.</blockquote>So said Fianna F&aacute;il six months ago.  This House is well used to Fianna F&aacute;il's year-zero approach to anything that took place between 1997 and 2011 but it appears that on this occasion, a special exemption is being made for 2012.  Earlier today, Deputy Fleming led a walkout of the Opposition from the Select Sub-committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, having falsely accused the Government of doing what his party had advocated - same old Fianna F&aacute;il.  </p><p> In conclusion, as a Government and as a society, we are now facing an extraordinarily serious and daunting challenge.  It is certainly the most serious challenge we have faced in generations and is probably more serious than any challenge except those faced by the founding Government of the State.  We are entering a critical period of our engagement with the troika, which I met this evening at 6 p.m.  We are moving to discuss our exit from the bailout programme.  Adherence to our budgetary targets remains as important as ever if we are to achieve this critical national goal.</p><p> Despite a media furore about public service pay, since taking office, this Government has remained wedded to walking the route of co-operation with public sector workers.  We want to work with trade unions that want to work with us.  We would like to afford public service workers the protections of a collective agreement and certainty.  It is for that reason that the Government decided today to ask the Labour Relations Commission to talk to all the parties involved to see if, even at this late stage, there is any possibility of an a negotiated outcome which meets the Government's and the country's spending targets.  I thank Mr. Mulvey and his team for accepting this task.  They contributed hugely to this process in the original discussions.  They are respected by all the parties involved and I know engagement with them will be honest and constructive.  For those reasons, I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

As outlined by the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il and its leader do not come to this issue with a clean pair of hands.  The party that had no compunction in unilaterally slashing the pay of public sector workers is now attempting to pose as the new best friend of the public service.  Its hope that the Irish people and public sector workers have short memories is as vain as this motion is nakedly self-serving.  Like the Bourbons, Fianna F&aacute;il has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  Public servants do not need to cast their memories back too far to recall a party that at the stroke of a pen took thousands of euros per year from their pockets without even the fig leaf or the courtesy of attempting to engage with the trade unions on an alternative approach.  The Government can do without Fianna F&aacute;il's advice on this matter.  The conduct of Fianna F&aacute;il on this and other critical issues of national importance is the equivalent of the arsonist who starts chucking stones at the fire brigade while telling the garda&iacute; that the blaze had nothing to do with him.  It is incomprehensible and a distraction from the main issue which has been concentrating the minds of the Government and many trade union officials, namely, the question of how we can resolve this major challenge in a fair and equitable manner.</p><p>  This motion makes extraordinary, inaccurate and downright misleading claims about the fairness and equity of the proposals voted on by public sector workers in recent weeks.  I do not intend to go into any great detail about a set of proposals that were, all things being equal, objectively fair and progressive in that they took more from those who had more to give and asked those earning under &euro;65,000 to make concessions on the productivity side but not on the core pay side.  All that being said, public sector workers have given their view on the proposals and the Government and I completely respect the outcome of the ballot, as has been iterated by the Minister.  While the outcome of the ballot demands that we seriously and earnestly reflect on the ramifications and the way forward, the mathematics and the required quantum of savings have not been altered.</p><p>  I have huge respect for colleagues in the trade union movement who stayed the course and worked with the realities of the situation that confronted their members, as most progressive trade union leaders do.  They confronted the situation as they objectively found it and worked under very challenging circumstances to ameliorate and mitigate the more egregious aspects of the propositions as originally tabled.  I welcome the fact that the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission will engage with the public sector union leaders to scope out the prospect and potential for engagement.  In this light, I believe trade union leaders would be reluctant to sacrifice some of the hard-fought gains extracted from the recent process - protection against outsourcing and excessive reliance on agency staff, no compulsory redundancies, protection of core pay for lower and middle-income workers and, crucially - if the House needs to be reminded - the benefits and opportunities provided by the system of collective approach traditionally taken in this country in recent years to the setting of wages and conditions in the public service.  There is a limit to the amount and depth of reform that can be achieved by alternative approaches outside of arrangements arrived by collective agreement.  I know this is a factor that will inform all our considerations in this House and those of the Government and unions in the coming days and weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="21:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300051#YY00300"><p>Like many Members of this House, I am disappointed that the Croke Park II proposals were rejected by the unions, but now that they have been rejected, it is important that we properly explore the reasons they were rejected and consider the views that were shared in order to determine the best course of action.  There is no easy option to be taken.  A total of &euro;300 million in savings must still be found from the public pay bill.  After the significant cuts to pay in recent years, there are no easy avenues to take on this occasion, and the necessary cuts will be a cause of great concern for many public sector workers.  The pay and pensions bill currently accounts for over 35% of all public spending and so, in order to bring the public finances back to a more sustainable level, that bill must be tackled.  The savings necessary for this year are significant in terms of getting public spending back on track but are also important in ensuring that Ireland's finances are put on a more sustainable footing in years to come.</p><p>  At all times the Government has endeavoured to proceed on the basis of consensus, and thus a lengthy negotiation process took place before the proposals rejected last week were finalised.  The proposals rejected last week would have seen &euro;1 billion in savings delivered through a range of pay and productivity measures as well as workplace reforms.  The aim of the proposals presented last week was to protect lower-paid public servants and would have protected the core salaries of the 87% of public service workers who earn under &euro;65,000.  That fact has been lost somewhere in the fog of debate surrounding this issue.  Protecting the pay of those who earn under &euro;65,000 was a significant element of the deal rejected last week, and this core protection was a key reason many public service workers opted to vote for the proposals despite the many harsh measures they contained.</p><p>  If legislation is the route pursued, although I hope this will be a last resort, it will institute pay cuts for public servants, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the Judiciary, and will also involve cuts to pension payments of former public servants.</p><p>There was a perception abroad that front-line workers were going to bear the brunt of these cuts.  However, the LRC proposals were, in fact, fairer than the perception.  For example, a staff nurse working 22 Sundays and public holidays and twilight shifts every two weeks would have seen a reduction of 3.8% in gross pay or 2% in net pay.  Similarly, a garda on the maximum point of the scale would have seen a drop of 3.6% in gross pay or 2.3% in net pay, while a primary teacher on the tenth point of the scale would have seen a a reduction of 3.5% in gross pay or 1.9% in net pay.  However, there are two points that are not represented by these figures.  First, many of the families concerned are already in considerable financial distress, having borrowed at the height of the property boom.  They now find themselves in negative equity and struggling to make mortgage repayments.  Second, the impact of workplace reforms on teachers whose supervision and substitution arrangements are being totally overhauled has to be noted.</p><p> Another misconception relates to the number of public servants on very high salaries.  As most public servants are only too aware, there are very few positions at the top end of the pay scale.  Some 1% of public servants are paid over &euro;150,000.  Under the proposals rejected last week, a senior public servant on &euro;175,000 would have faced a reduction of 7% in gross pay or 5.9% in net pay.</p><p> It is welcome that the Government has requested the head of the Labour Relations Commission to contact the various parties involved to establish if further negotiation can yield results.  Perhaps a teasing out of the exact reasons people voted &quot;No&quot; might point towards a possible solution to allow progress to be made in the coming weeks.  </p><p> One element of the entire set of proposals that needs to be looked at is pensions.  I note that the LRC recommendations do not relate to pensions currently in payment as the trade unions do not have a mandate to negotiate for pensioners.  It is the Government's stated intention to require public service pensioners to make a further contribution, ensuring an element of burden-sharing by higher paid pensioners.  It will remain incredibly difficult to sell this deal while former Taoisigh, politicians and bankers enjoy huge pensions.  This element needs to be tackled.  Many of those at the root of the problems we are facing have, apparently, sailed off into retirement without as much as a backward glance at the trail of destruction they have left in their wake, free to enjoy over-generous pensions paid by a nation which simply cannot afford such generosity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="21:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300052#ZZ00200"><p>The result of the ballot must be accepted by all of us.  I acknowledge that it was very difficult for public servants to be asked yet again to accept any pay reduction or a worsening of their conditions of work.  Like others, I recognise that public servants have made a very great contribution to efforts to tackle the appalling financial state in which the country finds itself.</p><p>  I commend the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for his work in this area.  He strove night and day, with very respected and hard working trade union leaders, to come up with a fair and equitable arrangement which, unfortunately, has been rejected.  I have no doubt that part of the reason for the rejection was that people were completely and utterly fed up with austerity, and that goes for every one of us.  The more we can persuade the central European authorities to loosen the purse strings to enable Europe's economy to expand again the better because this will help us to get out of what is a very difficult situation.</p><p>  It is clear from the details of the proposal that the Government was attempting to deal with the need to save &euro;300 million this year in as fair a manner as possible.  This is evident in the fact that only salaries greater than &euro;65,000 a year were to be cut in terms of core pay.  Politicians were rightly included in that pay cut, with other public servants such as doctors and judges who are also very well paid.  One of the commendable aspects of the arrangement was the effort to ensure fairness for lower paid workers.  For example, the position of younger teachers who had been disadvantaged was strengthened.  Deputy Gerald Nash referred to others who similarly had their positions protected.</p><p>  The problem dates back to when Fianna F&aacute;il negotiated with the troika.  Some cuts were not assigned to any particular area.  The result of that complete and utter fudge by Fianna F&aacute;il and also the meltdown in the public finances over which Fianna F&aacute;il presided is that the Government needs to reduce the public sector pay bill again.  This is a case of handling another unexploded mine which Fianna F&aacute;il passed on to the Government. </p><p>  I welcome today's news that in deciding how to achieve savings of &euro;300 million the Government has requested Mr. Mulvey to make contact with the unions to explore the possibility of holding talks.  I am convinced that the best way to deal with this issue is through negotiation.  It is far better than trying to ram through legislation and imposing something on workers who understandably are upset and unhappy.  It worth remembering that when Fianna F&aacute;il held the reins, it imposed a 7% reduction and cut the national minimum wage by &euro;1, thus taking &euro;35 to &euro;40 a week from the lowest paid workers, most of whom are women.</p><p>  The Government's proposed approach would help to guarantee industrial peace, which is obviously preferable to conflict and confrontation.  Whatever happens, it is vital that the 13% of public servants, including politicians, doctors and judges, bear the brunt of the cuts as was the case under the original plan.  Increments for higher paid civil servants should also be frozen.  It is highly regrettable that the Government has had to return to the situation where more public service pay reductions are necessary.  It is my hope this will be the last time they will be asked to accept reductions.  </p><p>  There is a very important message in the financial mess from which we are trying to escape.  It points to the need for a new type of politics with a sound economic base.  The societies in Europe which are most equal and fair are the Nordic countries.  These are also the countries that keep very tight control of their finances.  They do not allow themselves to go seriously into the red, whereas we have tended, particularly when led by Fianna F&aacute;il - it is very hard to resist that urge - to try to buy the electorate, rather than trying to sell it an idea as to how society should be organised, whether it be in the area of health or education, for example.  We need to get away from this type of politics.  We need to begin with a determination to maintain our economic base as strong as possible and then build as fair and equal society as possible.</p></speech>

Those on the Government benches are lauding the Croke Park deal.  Apparently, it was fair, progressive and equitable.  The message seems to be coming from the Government that anyone with an ounce of wit would have understood that it was so.  When workers came to vote, they had considered the matter very carefully.  It is all very well for Deputies to say the pain would not have been so bad for a nurse or a garda.</p><p>Nurses, garda&iacute;, teachers, front-line workers generally and clerical officers took out their calculators and did their sums and their conclusion was that the agreement was not equitable.  They were not prepared to sign up for it.  The Government can stick to its line of argument in respect of the deal, but to do so is academic.  The Government should remember, as it congratulates itself for not acting unilaterally and commends itself, as it does in its amendment to the motion, on its early and open engagement with public servants, that it made the choice to summon the unions to the table and agree a process which included an open and fair ballot of public and civil servants.  It defies logic that a Government that freely entered into the process and insisted that unions come to the table should set its face against the democratic verdict of the workers.</p><p> I do not believe, as some in the House may, that public and civil servants are lacking in the judgment department.  They looked at the deal, including pay and flexible work arrangements, and said &quot;No, thank you.&quot;  It is not because they are irresponsible.  Let us remember that over the last number of years, 30,000 public servants have been lost to the system.  Bear in mind that we face a further loss of 10,000.  Public and civil servants have heard the mantra of doing more with less repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>as they struggle in accident and emergency departments or continue to process medical cards and disability allowances.  It is the trite response and position of Government.  It should be borne in mind that this set of workers have had an average cut of 14% thus far.  In the case of new entrants, cuts have been as high as 25%.  It is not a sector of workers who have got off scot free - far from it.  Nevertheless, the Minister lauds himself as being &quot;wedded to walking the route of co-operation with public sector workers&quot;.  It is very interesting language.  I imagine the marriage will be very short-lived.  The Minister is wedded to this form of co-operation, yet he stands time and again, including this evening in the House, to point the finger at public and civil servants and tell them they got it wrong.  The Government has asked the Labour Relations Commission to intervene.  According to the Taoiseach, the commission has been given a two-week timeline to decide whether there is scope for a negotiated settlement.  The interesting thing is that the Government has clearly said to the LRC that it is still Croke Park II.  I can only gather from the Taoiseach and the Minister that those are the clear instructions.  While the workers have voted the deal down, the Government is trying a ruse to rehash it.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his colleagues correctly castigated the Fianna F&aacute;il administration for unilaterally savaging the pay of public and civil servants, but they have fallen short on that score in the wake of the rejection of Croke Park II.  Some members of Government, particularly the Minister, were vociferous in threatening workers and their unions with a 7% cut across the board.  In all of the reflection and discussion since the rejection of the Croke Park II, nobody has come out to say that threat has been withdrawn.  It is disgraceful, dishonourable and mind-boggling from an Administration that is wedded to walking the road of co-operation with unions.  It is not a very co-operative stance for the Government to take.  Not only has the Government failed to withdraw the threat of unilateral action, it has moved through the Houses of the Oireachtas to have the Revised Estimates considered and rubber-stamped by select committees.  The Revised Estimates have the Croke Park cuts hard-wired into them.  The Minister made reference to the fact that the combined Opposition left the Select Sub-committee on Public Expenditure and Reform today as a mark of protest at the fact that the Government - which is, let us remember, wedded to walking the road of co-operation with the unions - has decided to include in the Revised Estimates the very measures workers rejected comprehensively.</p><p> I predict that the Government will try by some ruse to get Croke Park II through.  While it is very critical of its predecessor, the Government has not only adopted its policies, it has also taken on a number of its bad habits.  One of its chief bad habits is the inability to understand that when a democratic process returns a verdict of &quot;No&quot;, &quot;No&quot; is the categoric answer.  That is what the workers have said.  I imagine the Government will try to find some tweak or manoeuvre to get this through.  It will not succeed.  As a last resort, the Government, particularly the Labour Party, will keep the option of legislating for cuts.  Everyone must understand that the workers who have resisted this deal by democratic ballot will resist, quite correctly, any attempt by Government to impose a legislative cut unilaterally.  To do so would be bad politics and bad form.  To claim that one is anti-austerity as a member of a Government that has heaped austerity on low- and middle-income families in particular is nothing short of a bad joke.  Everybody has been hurt.  Workers in the private sector have taken a significant hit.  Those families we refer to as the working poor know all about austerity but so too do low- and middle-income workers in the public and civil service.  The CPSU, which represents clerical officers, rejected the deal by 87%.  It is more than definitive; it is overwhelming.  They are not wrong.  They knew full well the implications of the deal for their pay packets and their working lives.</p><p> The Minister with responsibility for Croke Park, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will no doubt attempt to revive and resuscitate the agreement.  I wish him nothing but the best of bad luck in his endeavours.</p></speech>

It complains about "the inconsistency of treatment of different categories of public sector employees".  To call for fairness and balance in the aftermath of the rejection of Croke Park II is typical Fianna F&aacute;il manoeuvring and reeks of hypocrisy and political opportunism.  When it was in power, Fianna F&aacute;il could have introduced reforms to benefit low- and middle-income workers, but it did nothing.  Its legacy is, rather, a public service that is bloated at the top with overpaid bureaucrats while the vast majority work for low and middle incomes.</p><p>What makes Fianna F&aacute;il's Private Members' motion even more nauseating is the fact that in 2010 when the party was in power, 2,855 public servants were in receipt of family income supplement because they could not survive on the poverty wages that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and his party stood over.  So let us not be fooled by Fianna F&aacute;il's recently discovered bleeding heart.  When in power, the party is as ruthless, anti-worker, and pro the <i>status quo</i>as Fine Gael any day.  Since Fine Gael has come into power, the number of public service workers in receipt of family income supplement has increased.  Under Fianna F&aacute;il it was 2,855 in 2010 and, as of April 2013, it is 3,339, an increase of 484 workers under the current Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  If evidence were needed that Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are two sides of the same coin, this is it.</p><p> In government, both parties are prepared to preside over a public service where over 8% of workers are officially classed as the working poor and dependent on Government hand-outs for basic survival.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour have no problem with almost 9% of hard working public servants earning poverty wages.  If both parties were genuinely concerned about low and middle income public sector workers, they have had many opportunities to address the huge gap in terms of pay between the high earners at the top and the bulk of public servants, who are middle and low income workers.</p><p> Before union members voted on Croke Park II, Sinn F&eacute;in was of the view it was a bad deal for ordinary workers.  It was a bad deal for nurses, teachers, garda&iacute;, clerical staff, support staff, ambulance and fire crews and all the other occupations that make up our public service.  Public sector workers have now spoken and Sinn F&eacute;in commends them on their stand against austerity.  They are put to the pin of their collar and can take no more.  One third of the public sector earns the average industrial wage or less.  Another two thirds can be defined as middle to low income.  These workers and their families did not bring the country to the edge of economic ruin.  They did not borrow millions during the boom years.  They did not live lavish lifestyles or surround themselves with expensive trinkets bought on borrowed money.  These are ordinary women and men who work long and often unsocial hours to put food on the table and a roof over their families' heads.  Austerity is not working and the socialising of private debt is bad economic policy and damaging to society and the body politic.</p><p> There is another way.  If the Government is serious about reform of the public sector, it should eliminate runaway pay at the top and gold-plated pensions.  In its budget proposals for 2013, Sinn F&eacute;in suggested a third tax band of 48% on individual incomes in excess of &euro;100,000.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports ordinary public sector workers and will continue to oppose any and all efforts to cut their pay or alter existing agreements that would have a negative impact on their working conditions.</p></speech>

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this important debate on the public sector, the Croke Park agreement and the broader economy.  I am not surprised by the rejection of the Croke Park II proposal.  Most public servants I know are hopping mad because of the way they were treated by the Government.  That is the harsh reality.  Even moderate people are fuming because they have taken a major hit.  Now, the Government wants them to take more in an economic climate where people's backs are to the wall.</p><p>  Some of the comments and publicity I hear about public servants gets up my nose.  Most of the Ministers, commentators and politicians would not last five minutes in an accident and emergency unit, in a disadvantaged school, or on duty on a Sunday morning stopping fighting and anti-social behaviour as part of ambulance or fire-fighter teams and being abused and attacked trying to help people in the wider world.  That is the reality for many public servants.  They are right to be angry and to make their views known.</p><p>  Does the Government realise the difficulties the proposed changes to conditions of employment will have on many families?  Does it realise the inconsistency of the treatment of different categories of public sector employees under the Government's proposals and the disproportionate impact the proposed measures would have had on the pay and earnings of front-line and shift workers?  Is the Minister of State aware of the major sacrifices made by public sector employees and pensioners in recent years?  Is she aware of the ongoing savings being delivered by the Croke Park agreement, the significant benefit to the economy and the need to ensure further reductions in the public sector pay and pensions bill occurs in a fair and structured manner?  Is she aware of the importance of a shared commitment to reform by all stakeholders in the delivery of public services?  Is she aware of the major negative impact for SMEs because of cuts and reductions?  I support the motion in calling for the immediate engagement by the Government with public sector employees, confirmation that the Government will not legislate for a 7% cut in public sector pay, and full disclosure of all relevant facts prior to the conclusion of the new agreement on public sector pay.</p></speech>

This is the party that cut the wages of workers.  It is the kettle calling the pot black.  I am opposed to the Private Members' motion and the Government amendment.  Both motions target public sector workers for major cuts, amounting to &euro;300 million a year and &euro;1 billion by 2015.  Public servants have been unfairly targeted and they have already lost 14% to 22% through wage cuts.  They have already had the so-called pension levy and lost 30,000 through redundancies in the service, with more to follow.  There were some 6,000 redundancies in the health services and there is also a moratorium on recruitment.</p><p>  The rejection of Croke Park II is a blow to the Government and to the overpaid trade union bureaucrats.  It is the beginning of a rank and file fightback to take back the unions from bureaucrats, many of whom were in league with the Government's austerity programme.  Workers have rejected austerity and they resent being forced to shoulder responsibility for a recession they had no hand, act or part in creating.  Trade union leaders would be betraying those who voted &quot;No&quot; and said they had enough of austerity and cuts if they were to enter talks again.  The talks will only focus on how cuts are to be distributed across public sector workers.  There must be no concessions to the cuts agenda.</p><p>  Following the Croke Park II vote, trade union leaders have no mandate to enter talks on the cuts agenda.  If the trade union leaders want the introduction of progressive taxes, they should refuse to let the Government off the hook.  They should refuse to enter talks and launch a campaign of all public sector workers seeking the tax changes identified by ICTU.  If they really believe austerity has failed, they should lead a campaign for a real alternative.  Unfortunately, the reality is the trade union leaders are more concerned with protecting the Labour Party in government than advancing the position of their members.</p><p>  It is a pity the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, left the Chamber.  It is shameful that a Labour Party Minister would attempt to cut pay and pensions, undermine the working conditions of workers and threaten them with cuts through legislation of 7%.  What would Connolly have thought of that?  What would Jim Larkin, who led Dublin workers 100 years ago this year in the 1913 Lock-out, think of it?  What would Helena Moloney and Delia Larkin, founders of the Irish Women Workers Union in 1911 to support the rights of women workers, think of that?  What would the founders of the Labour Party in my home town of Clonmel in 1912, just over 100 years ago, think of it?  The Minister should consider his position and he should resign.</p></speech>

The combined wholesale and retail sector in Ireland employs 273,000 people.  The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  A number of new measures of particular assistance to retail businesses under pressure have been introduced by this Government including: the introduction of the Micro Finance Loan Fund and Credit Guarantee Scheme; reform of wage setting mechanisms and removal from the JLCs of the setting of a Sunday premium; extension of seed capital and employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector and reduction of employers PRSI and a low rate of VAT for certain sectors.</p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures.  The retail sector has been chosen to pilot the licencing initiative as it is one of the sectors which requires a multiplicity of licences and where the positive impact of streamlining the application process can be realised fairly quickly.  The intention is that an integrated licensing application system, incorporating up to 25 licences in the retail sector, will be developed in 2013. Additionally, the Government has committed to strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance and integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses.</p><p>  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  The composition of the Group is currently under consideration by officials in my Department. The Terms of Reference for the Group will be agreed by the Group at its first meeting, which is due to take place in the 2nd quarter of 2013.</p></reply>

IDA has transformed its investment profile with RDI projects increasing from &euro;80m in 2004 to &euro;700m in 2011 - representing some 50% of IDA investment wins. It was most encouraging to see that the recent European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems.  In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness ranking improved four places from 24th in 2011, to 20th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012.</p><p>  IBM&rsquo;s Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland:</p><p>  - 1st in the world for inward investment by quality and value;</p><p>  - 1st in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;</p><p>  - 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector; and,</p><p>  - 2nd is Europe and 4th globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p><p>  In a modern economy, highly innovative sectors deliver high returns. In Ireland, we have some of the largest and most dynamic medical device and pharmaceutical companies in the world. Nine of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world have a base in Ireland, as do eight of the top 10 medtech companies. The life sciences sector in Ireland accounts for over 50,000 jobs and &euro;50 billion worth of exports. High value added, productive manufacturing is increasingly dynamic, sophisticated and innovative and requires investment in research and development. Statistics show that exports from R&amp;amp;D performing companies have increased from &euro;44bn in 2003 to &euro;111bn in 2011, while for non R&amp;amp;D performing companies, exports decreased from &euro;48bn to &euro;30bn over the same period.  This clearly demonstrates the significant contribution investment in R&amp;amp;D makes to the national recovery effort.</p><p>  There are a number of factors which are likely to affect growth in industry; export-led growth is essential for a return to sustainable economic recovery and it is identified as a key component of the Programme for Government. Cost competitiveness is a critical foundation of international competitiveness and we are cognisant that we must use research and innovation to build a competitive advantage. Irish cost competitiveness has improved markedly over the last three years and we need to ensure this improvement continues.  Continued innovation in products and services is also crucial in building a competitive advantage.  Measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 and include improved access to finance by SMEs, further improving our skills base, encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start‐up activity, assisting our businesses to grow, and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. Building competitive advantage is also a key driver of growth and the Action Plan includes a particular focus on using Research and Innovation to drive job creation.</p><p>  In this context, the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to accelerate the economic and societal return on our STI investment, especially in terms of sustainable jobs.  In particular we aim to further strengthen enterprise engagement with and take-up of public research and to drive commercialisation. A number of initiatives are being rolled out across Government in support of this strategy.  Implementation across Government Departments and agencies of the recommendations in the report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group seeks to maximise the impact of our spend by focussing the majority of public competitive research funding on 14 priority areas which are most likely to deliver societal and economic impact. Other initiatives include expanding the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to cover applied research; a new Intellectual Property Protocol which gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research; the establishment of a Central Technology Transfer Office to act as a one stop shop providing an effective interface between industry and the research community; and the R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme which continues to encourage business to invest in research.</p></reply>

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties.  </p><p>  As matters currently stand for those employees who are obliged by their contract of employment to retire at 65 years but will not receive the State pension until 66 years, the Department of Social Protection have indicated that, in terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection, which has lead responsibility for the State pension and pension age policy, is chairing an inter-Departmental Group on Working and Retirement issues, on which my Department is represented.  That Department organised and chaired a Working and Retirement Forum in Croke Park last December, at which a range of stakeholder groups discussed, amongst other matters, issues related to the alignment of mandatory retirement age practices with the new State pension age.  The Group is currently considering the issues highlighted at the Croke Park Forum and is preparing preliminary proposals in this regard.</p><p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  Directive 2000/78/EC is principally given effect in national law by the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011, which come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alan Shatter, T.D.  With regard to the extension of contracts, the Employment Equality Acts currently permit an employer to offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory (contractual) retirement age for that employment.</p></reply>

This was the first formal meeting of the EPSCO Council under the Irish Presidency.  I co-chaired the Employment and Social Policy element of the meeting along with my colleague, Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of the formal Council proceedings, there was a meeting between the President of the European Council and EPSCO Ministers which Ireland had convened at the request of President Van Rompuy. The informal discussions focused on better ways of co-ordinating economic and fiscal policies as well as enhancing the social dimension of the EMU, including social dialogue. </p><p>  Deliberations at the formal Council meeting included political agreement being reached on the Youth Guarantee.  This is a significant achievement for our Presidency.  The Council Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that every young person under the age of 25 receives a quality offer of employment, or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship, within four months of becoming unemployed.  When implemented, the Youth Guarantee will contribute to three out of the five Europe 2020 targets by:</p><p>  - increasing the employment rate,</p><p>  - reducing the extent of early school leaving, and</p><p>  - lifting people out of poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>  There were two policy debates during the Council.  Minister Burton chaired a lunch time debate on &ldquo;Pension rights to support Labour Mobility&rdquo; while I chaired a debate on the &ldquo;European Semester&rdquo;.  There was broad support for the valuable role the Semester process plays in working towards our Europe 2020 targets.  EPSCO also adopted the Commission&rsquo;s 2013 Joint Employment Report and Council Conclusions on the Annual Growth Survey.  The Council made a series of recommendations that fed into the European Council meeting on 14 and 15 March which provided guidance to national governments on strategies to be set out in their National Reform Programmes and Stability and Convergence Programmes.</p><p>  The 2013 European Semester is now well under way. This is a significant challenge as we move into the second half of our Presidency.  Member States are currently submitting their National Reform Programmes to the Commission for assessment. The results of that assessment will be presented on 29th May, together with proposals for country-specific recommendations for consideration by the EPSCO and ECOFIN Councils. </p><p>  The Presidency's Synthesis Report on the Implementation of the European Semester reflected the view that the EU needs to ensure effective delivery of efforts along the five priorities set in the Annual Growth Survey: differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness; tackling unemployment and modernising public administration. In the areas specific to the EPSCO Council, it identified the need for Member States to address the following priorities:</p><p>  - active employment, social and labour market policies with particular priority to be given to promoting youth employment;</p><p>  - better performing education and training systems, ensuring that young people are equipped with the right skills and linking the worlds of work and education more effectively;</p><p>  - continued application to increasing female labour participation rates, reducing long term unemployment and ensuring full participation of older workers;</p><p>  - tackling the social consequences of the crisis and fight poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>  The Commission introduced its proposal for a Social Investment Package (SIP).  The measures in the package are aimed at enhancing people's capacities to support better involvement in society and better participation in the labour market. The intention is to benefit individuals' prosperity, boost the economy and help the EU emerge from the crisis stronger, more cohesive and more competitive.</p></reply>

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region.  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council and, also, of the North South Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, and particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my N.I. counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of business issues of mutual interest.</p><p>  My officials engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (D'ETI). A key area of such regular engagement is on the operation of <i>InterTradeIreland</i> , the North/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body, which is co-funded by my Department and D'ETI.  I am pleased that despite the serious economic pressures, I have been able to ensure that no significant cutbacks have been applied to our funding of that body over recent years.  Another key area of engagement at Departmental level is our joint support for enterprise projects under the <i>Interreg</i> initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by either D'ETI or the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel. The most recent significant such project involves the establishment of a significant North West Science Park, to be co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, in respect of which we have agreed financial support.  Officials in both jurisdictions are also engaged in a process which will hopefully see a new <i>Interreg</i>   Scheme initiated when the current phase expires in 2014. Officials of my Department are also engaging with D'ETI in relation to work on the EU's Regional Aid guidelines.</p><p>  In addition to direct Departmental engagement, there is a long history of co-operative action between enterprise agencies on both sides of the border to achieve mutual benefits. <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  <i>IDA Ireland</i> collaborates with <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now</i>  initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on Science and Technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.</p><p>  Several of the County Enterprise Boards in the border area are engaged in co-operative economic initiatives with various bodies in Northern Ireland, some funded by the enterprise strand of the <i>Interreg</i> programmes referred to above.  My Department, along with our enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with our counterpart Department and relevant Northern Ireland Agencies to increase the economic benefits, especially on job creation, research and innovation, which can accrue from practical co-operation.</p></reply>

The combined wholesale and retail sector in Ireland employs 273,000 people, which is one in every 7 people who were working in Ireland at the end of 2012.  The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  There are a number of bodies representing different parts of the retail sector, with RGDATA representing independent family owned grocery shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets.</p><p>  I launched the first of AIB&rsquo;s series of outlook reports for the SME sector on Friday last 19 April.  As that report was focussed on the retail sector and undertaken in conjunction with RGDATA, I met the Director General of RGDATA, at that event.  In addition, RGDATA was part of a &ldquo;Local Jobs Alliance&rdquo; delegation which met with Minister Bruton in September 2012.  In addition, a representative of RGDATA sits on the High Level Group on Business Regulation which I Chair as the Minister for Small Business, so we engage regularly on issues relevant to the retail and small business sector through that forum, including the meeting of 30 January last.  RGDATA have been active in making input in many areas affecting the business climate and many of the reforms introduced by Government have responded to these concerns.</p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  We are currently introducing new initiatives including:</p><p>  - Rationalisation of 25 retail licences and provision of a single retail licensing system;</p><p>  - Promoting a proposed competitive voucher scheme to assist retailers to go online;</p><p>  - Strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance;</p><p>  - Integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses. </p><p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of possible further measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  RGDATA will be one of the representative bodies which is consulted as part of that examination of the retail sector.</p></reply>

Energy Costs remain relatively high in Ireland, particularly for SMEs.  While Ireland is the sixth most expensive location from 15 countries benchmarked, the cost of water for industrial users remains relatively unchanged since 2007. Waste costs in Ireland remain relatively high, particularly for landfill, while Ireland is also relatively expensive for broadband, particularly when broadband quality is considered.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs process, Forf&aacute;s undertook a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness. The sectors examined in the report are energy, telecommunications, transport, waste and water. The report, which was published yesterday, also assesses Ireland&rsquo;s cost performance in these sectors relative to our key competitor countries and the drivers of costs, in particular what drivers are within and outside our control in each of the sectors studied. </p><p>  The study finds that in many cases policy actions have a more significant impact on cost competitiveness than regulatory changes. The report suggests that there are a number of areas where changes to the operation of sectoral regulators could have a real and positive impact on cost competitiveness. These changes relate to the focus of regulatory mandates, the level and adequacy of resources, enforcement powers and sanctions available to the regulators, and the efficiency of the appeal process.  The recommendations set out in these two Forf&aacute;s reports will require careful consideration by all of Government before appropriate policy responses can be developed. However the Government is already working on the development of a policy statement on Economic Regulation and has opened a public consultation process on the matter.</p></reply>

Core to this work is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s parent Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on trade promotion. Enterprise Ireland also works closely with other Government Departments, such as Agriculture, Food and Marine, and Education and Skills, on developing specific sector export opportunities and enhancing the capabilities of these sectors to win more exports.</p><p>  In terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, collaboration is strong with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international offices co-located with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or another agency wherever possible.  This involves 22 of EI&rsquo;s 29 locations overseas.  A key forum is also the Export Trade Council which was established by Government. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Executive Frank Ryan attends the Council, chaired by the Tanaiste and that forum has a key role in fostering a collaborative approach to building Ireland&rsquo;s trade base.</p><p>  The relationship and collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is strong at all levels both in Ireland and in overseas markets.  In Ireland, Enterprise Ireland have a strong collaborative relationship with the Trade and Promotion Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on a wide range of areas, including:</p><p>  - Developing Ministerial led Enterprise Ireland Trade missions and events. 16 such Trade Missions were undertaken in 2012, double the number in 2011, with 18 scheduled during 2013.</p><p>  - Joint Economic Commissions (JECs)</p><p>  - Messaging overseas</p><p>  - Annual Market plans for each priority market as agreed with the Government&rsquo;s Export Trade Council.</p><p>  Overseas there is equally strong collaboration in individual territories between the relevant Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade team led by the relevant Ambassador or Consul General in that market.  This interaction covers a wide range of areas including;</p><p>  - Detailed information sharing and joint working,</p><p>  - Discussion on priorities and coordinating the focus of activities in the particular market,</p><p>  - Coordination on trade promotion activities,</p><p>  - Leveraging various networks such as the Global Irish Network,</p><p>  - Development and implementation of action plans /  priorities for Joint Economic Commissions where we have such JEC&rsquo;s,</p><p>  - Leveraging Ministerial visits and International Trade Missions,</p><p>  - Influencing discussions on trade issues / barriers where in some instances these represent a barrier to growth in bilateral trade with a particular country.</p><p>  It is worth noting, however, that the vast majority of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work overseas by its nature is direct detailed one to one client company work, assisting the thousands of existing and potential exporting Irish companies to identify specific potential market opportunities, evaluate those opportunities, develop detailed plans and strategies to target and secure new customers in new markets/sectors and build their export sales in those markets.

This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and stimulation and economic recovery and growth. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that it is a complex project much progress has taken place.  In particular agreement has being reached recently on the Framework Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. This is a key document and will be the blueprint for each Local Enterprise Office going forward. The SLA sets out the structure, functions and role of the LEO as well as the respective roles of Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authority. It lays down the operating environment for each LEO i.e. protocols relating to project selection and evaluation, budgetary matters, corporate governance matters as well as the policies, guidelines and metrics required in each LEO. In addition the new LEO branding and associated logo has been designed and agreed. I will shortly publish and launch the SLA, and the LEO branding and logo both of which are tangible steps to the full rollout of the new infrastructure.</p><p>  The finalisation of LEO locations, accommodation arrangements and personnel resources for each LEO is continuing and increased focus will now be placed on the &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; issues such as integration of IT systems and Financial Management systems, management of transfer of data etc. all of which will be central to a smooth transition from a CEB structure to a Local Authority based LEO. It is vital to get these elements right so as to ensure a seamless transition in terms of client service and delivery upon dissolution of the CEBs.  In relation to the formal dissolution of the CEBs officials of my Department are continuing, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, to develop draft legislation with a view to bringing the Bill to Government shortly, with a view to enactment before the summer recess.</p></reply>

The availability of such data is crucial to understanding the background and context of the various business and trade issues which both our administrations are addressing.  A significant range of such economic data is compiled by our Central Statistics Office and by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) and this is publicly available. From time to time other research is undertaken by Departments and bodies on both sides of the border. Specifically relevant is the work of <i>InterTradeIreland,</i> the North South Implementation Body with specific responsibility for promoting trade development on an all-island basis, and which is co-funded by my Department, as this body has analysed and published data on key cross-border economic activities.  This is a valuable source of information to help inform future business activity and enhance cross-border engagement.</p><p>  In relation specifically to the finances of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, I am very happy to confirm that the Body's budget has been kept relatively intact over the last number of years despite the enormous budgetary cuts implemented elsewhere. This has meant that that body has been able to roll out many successful programmes including FUSION, (Technology transfer), INNOVA (Collaborative Research &amp;amp; Development) and ACUMEN (Cross-border sales). I will of course continue to keep <i>InterTradeIreland's</i> operations under review but we must of course, be conscious of the fact that there should be no duplication of their work with existing programmes undertaken by the other enterprise development Agencies and bodies.</p><p>  In relation to job creation North and South, this is a key priority of both administrations on the island and we work closely on a range of initiatives. In addition to co-funding <i>InterTradeIreland,</i> as mentioned above, I regularly meet my counterpart Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  There is successful cooperation with the N.I. administration to ensure the implementation of the EU's INTERREG programme which assists enterprise development and both Departments work to ensure that all relevant areas for potential enterprise development, between the two jurisdictions for mutual benefit, are pursued. In addition, both <i>Enterprise Ireland</i> and <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>  have a long history of cooperation and have developed and rolled out many effective cross-border enterprise development initiatives that have benefitted firms in both jurisdictions and in the border region. The enterprise agencies will continue to work closely to ensure that all cross-border business opportunities are exploited.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the Act is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system. The Act provides for a radical overhaul of the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the July 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p><p>  Workers that were in employment in a JLC sector prior to the July 2011 judgment, continue, unless otherwise agreed with their employer, to be covered by their individual contracts of employment and enjoy the terms set out in the ERO that was in place up to 7 July 2011. Workers who commenced employment in those sectors after 7 July 2011 are covered by the full suite of employment rights legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.  The 2012 Act also provides that a Review of each Joint Labour Committee be carried out by the Labour Court. The aim of the review is to ensure that the range of sectors and enterprises to which they apply remains appropriate, with consequent changes to their Establishment Orders if necessary. That Review was completed on 12 April 2013. </p><p>  The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.  The Labour Court submitted its report of the review and recommendations in relation to the 10 existing JLCs to me only yesterday, 22 April. The report is detailed, comprehensive and complex and will require careful examination and consideration.  I would hope to be in a position to indicate my response shortly.</p><p>  It will ultimately be a matter for each Joint Labour Committee to negotiate the terms and conditions of employment for workers in their respective sectors and to be set out in proposals for Employment Regulation Orders which will require a Ministerial Order to be given legal effect.  Under the terms of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, the Government will report to the Troika by end June 2013 on the impact on the labour market of reforms to sectoral wage setting mechanisms undertaken under the programme of financial assistance. Forf&aacute;s is currently carrying out this review. </p><p>  The National Competitiveness Council reports on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. The most recent report, while acknowledging an improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, identified a number of issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable, long-lasting competitiveness gains. Ireland must maintain focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy including issues relating to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.</p><p>  A recently published (April 2013) Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; indicates that labour costs in Ireland have fallen marginally since 2008 and when compared with the Euro area, where labour costs have been rising in recent years, our competiveness position in this area has shown a significant improvement.  However the report also indicates that labour costs in Ireland have started to increase, albeit at a lower rate than elsewhere in the Euro area.  The report makes a number of recommendations which can improve the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market, encourage employment creation and maximise labour supply. I and my colleagues in Government, will consider the recommendations set out in this report and develop appropriate policy responses to ensure that Irish labour costs remain competitive.</p></reply>

The Competition Authority is the statutory independent body responsible for enforcing national and EU competition law in the State.  In fulfilling this function it investigates suspected breaches of competition law and takes enforcement action where appropriate.  The Authority also has a function to promote competition in the economy and it does so by, inter alia, studying areas of the economy to examine how competition is working and by identifying legislation and administrative practices that impact negatively on competition.  </p><p>  The Authority has carried out detailed market studies into a number of sectors of the economy to establish how competition is working in those sectors and to identify any restrictions that hinder competition.  In this context the Authority has made recommendations, addressed to relevant Government Ministers, aimed at removing barriers or restrictions to competition within the sectors.  The Authority is currently examining how competition is working in the ports sector in Ireland and it has previously examined aspects of banking and insurance, the retail planning guidelines, the import/distribution sector and a number of professions including the legal profession, GPs, and architects.  </p><p>  Whether it is through the elimination of anti-competitive behaviour such as price-fixing and other cartel-like practices or through effect been given to Competition Authority recommendations the result is a more competitive and innovative environment with lower costs and greater job opportunities.</p></reply>

As I have pointed out on many occasions, the Government does not create jobs &ndash; entrepreneurs and successful businesses do.  However, the Government has a lead role to play in providing the environment where businesses can start-up, expand and create jobs.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  My role and that of other Government Ministers and Departments is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support enterprise growth and innovation so that employment can be created and maintained.  The Action Plan for Jobs focuses on the creation of a supportive environment for businesses so that they can retain existing jobs and create new ones.  We are transforming our economy, step by step, by taking measures across all Government Departments and many State agencies to remove administrative burdens on business, improve their access to finance, further improve our export performance and support the development of key growth sectors.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is aimed at supporting the transition from the old, failed economy reliant on property, banking and debt to a new, sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation. In the year since we launched the first plan that transition has been gathering momentum, with 12,000 net jobs added in the private sector in 2012 and a record year for job-creation by exporting companies in multinational and indigenous sectors in the same year.</p><p>  One of the significant benefits of the approach taken in the Action Plan is that is has focussed Agencies and Departments right across Government to put forward measures that would make it easier for enterprises to develop opportunities and create employment. It is not of course possible to attach a specific job&rsquo;s target to many of these actions.  The results from 2012 demonstrate that the plan is working. However, the Government acknowledges that we have a long way to go.  If we are to sustain and accelerate this positive movement, we must continue a relentless focus across Government on jobs and competitiveness.  The challenge now is to build on the progress we have made, work harder, deliver more ambitious change &ndash; and we are determined to do that to tackle our number one priority and create the jobs we need.</p></reply>

Contracts and commitments worth over &euro;200 million to the Irish Economy were signed during the trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2012.  These contracts, together with the other business links established during the events, have helped grow and sustain jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies.  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland client company employment totalled more than 169,000 on a full and part time basis, representing a growth in full time jobs of 3,338 in the year.</p><p>The Investment missions organised by IDA Ireland are more intimate in style. Typically, the programme involves meeting with Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies, across all sectors.  Some of the companies which I met during 2012 already had substantial and valuable activities in Ireland and those meetings focussed on retaining, expanding and further embedding their presence here.  For companies who do not have a presence in Ireland, the focus was to underpin Ireland as a location for the proposed investment against intense competition from other locations around the world.</p><p>Immediate job creation is not expected from this type of mission as, typically, jobs are created over a period of between 3 and 5 years, depending on the company&rsquo;s business plan. I should point out, however, that IDA client companies created a total of 12,722 jobs during 2012. The net number of new jobs created at 6,570 represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment, while job losses in IDA client companies were the lowest in a decade.</p><p>Details of

Parties may engage either on a voluntary basis through the Labour Relations Commission using the mediation and conciliation services, or under the Industrial Relations Acts to the Labour Court. In some cases, parties to a dispute agree in advance to be bound by the decision of the Labour Court.  The objective of the industrial relations machinery is to encourage either mediated or decision based outcomes for the parties.</p><p>  Employees may also make complaints directly to the Rights Commissioner Service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal under employment legislation.  The enforcement of Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) determinations and Labour Court rulings under employment legislation are a matter for the courts.  In cases other than those covered by the Payment of Wages Act, the Enforcement Services Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has some capacity to have a determination of the EAT enforced through the civil courts.</p><p>  In general, where an award has been made in favour of an employee, the employer has six weeks in which to comply.  If the employer fails to do so within this period, the employee, or the employee's trade union, may make an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to comply with the determination.  Where an employee is not in a position to do so the matter can be referred to NERA Enforcement Services Unit, which may, in certain circumstances, make an application to the Courts for an order on his/her behalf.  In deciding whether or not to intervene in the Minister&rsquo;s name, NERA has regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The enforcement of a Circuit Court order in these circumstances is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff and my Department has no capacity to intervene.</p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent and where a determination has been made by the EAT or an appeal to the Labour Court is in favour of employees, employees are entitled to seek redress from the State through the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s key policy instrument to achieve this is the Action Plan for Jobs.  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on 22nd February.  The Plan contains 333 individual actions, broken down further into Quarterly deliverables. My Department and its agencies are responsible for delivering approximately 190 or 57% of the actions.</p><p>  As was the case last year, the delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs will be overseen by a Monitoring Committee co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Secretary General to the Government.  Quarterly Progress Reports will be published on the achievement of the deliverables and this will include the job creation figures where applicable.  In addition, I regularly meet with the Chief Executive Officers of the Enterprise Development Agencies to discuss, inter alia, progress towards a range of targets, including jobs targets.</p><p>  In relation to the microfinance loan fund, Microfinance Ireland the company which administers the scheme, provides my Department with quarterly reports and has just compiled its report for the first 6 months (1 October 2012 - 31 March 2013). I can report that to end March, the scheme has supported 116 jobs in 44 microenterprises.</p><p>  I would emphasise that the transformation needed to grow jobs in our economy will be through deliberate and determined action across all areas of Government and the private sector. One year into the Action Plan for Jobs process, we can see the evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. Over 90% of the 270 individual commitments in last year&rsquo;s action plan were completed during 2012, we are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables, our exports are at record high levels and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best jobs growth figures in 2012 many years. Overall, the level of private sector employment is stabilising, as evidenced in the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey figures for Q4 2012 which showed the first annual increase in employment since the second quarter of 2008.</p></reply>

Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, Enterprise Ireland will continue to develop the recently published Potential Exporters Division as a new way of engaging with Irish companies that are not yet exporting.  Furthermore, in 2013 in direct response to the demands of entrepreneurs and client companies, a number initiatives are being rolled out in the areas of funding supports, export information and advice, R&amp;amp;D, management strategy and advice, and building competitiveness.</p><p>  Specifically under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, a number of capacity building initiatives will be supported as follows:</p><p>  - Competitive Start Funds (CSF) for specific groups of very early stage entrepreneurs (investing &euro;50k per start-up) &ndash; more than 155 High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) and CSF start-ups are targeted;</p><p>  - 15 Ministerial trade missions focused on sectors and High Growth economies are also targeted in 2013;</p><p>  - More than 300 mentors will be appointed to provide tailored advice and guidance to Enterprise Ireland clients; </p><p>  - A Pilot Initiative will be commenced focusing on enabling companies to research, evaluate and plan market entry strategies in new geographic markets;</p><p>  - Support 800 participants on short course Management Development Programmes. 170 participants have already commenced or signed up for these courses.</p><p>  - A participation target of 230 has been set for long term course Management Development participation across a number of courses including, &quot;Management 4 Growth&quot;, &quot;Leadership 4 Growth&quot;, the International Selling Programme and the Accelerated Growth Programme for CEOs of HPSUs.  This target is also set to be met. </p><p>  These supports are in addition, to Enterprise Ireland's continuing financial supports for client companies and are complimented by other measures, including, for example, the support of EI&rsquo;s overseas office network.</p></reply>

Innovation Vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are available to assist a company or companies to explore a business opportunity or problem with a registered knowledge provider.</p><p>  The Innovation Vouchers initiative, administered by Enterprise Ireland, has been designed to stimulate an on-going cultural shift with regard to innovation within the small business sector while bridging the gap that exists between the small business community and public research bodies. The vouchers can be used to facilitate knowledge transfer from the public research sector and small businesses and are available to the widest possible range of small businesses in Ireland.  Applicants need not necessarily be clients of Enterprise Ireland.  For the purposes of the Innovation Voucher Initiative, a Small Enterprise is defined as a company or (if part of a group) a group of companies where the total number of full-time employees in the company (or the entire group) is less than 50 and has either an annual turnover and/or an annual Balance Sheet total not exceeding &euro;10m. Small enterprises in the agricultural sector are excluded in line with State aid guidelines.</p><p>  Under the current guidelines<b>, </b>companies with charitable status, commercial semi-state companies, &quot;not for profit&quot; organisations, trade associations and company representation bodies such as Chambers of Commerce are not eligible to participate in the innovation voucher initiative.<b></b>This refinement of eligibility criteria was undertaken to direct the activity of the programme to companies involved in commercial enterprise or business whose main focus is generating jobs and/or exports.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises that an important source of knowledge, expertise and competitive advantage available to small companies can be found in the research departments of Institutes of Technology and Irish Universities. The Innovation Vouchers scheme gives small companies access to this vast source of innovative acumen and in so doing acts as an important facet of knowledge transfer from the third level to industry. These vouchers worth &euro;5,000 can be used by the average small Irish company to purchase advice and knowledge that is new to the company.</p><p>  Innovation Vouchers were designed with the aim of planting the seed of innovation in small businesses, encouraging them to look to their future and seize the opportunities that knowledge and Innovation can bring.  As a measure of the success of the scheme in fostering collaboration, many of the companies who worked with a knowledge provider have since applied for more substantial funding from programmes like Enterprise Ireland's Innovation Partnership programme.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of my Department is that of ensuring the protection of employment rights and worker health and safety. This objective is shared across a number of other Government Departments at a sectoral level.</p><p>  In the case of the Tit Bonhomme, I welcome the response of the lead Department in this instance, the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, to the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) report into the sinking of the Tit Bonhomme. That Department is in the process of implementing all of the safety recommendations in the MCIB report. I note in particular, the intent to enforce the European Community (Workers on board sea-going fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) Regulations, 2003 (S.I.709 of 2003). This along with the implementation of the other recommendations will greatly assist in encouraging a strong safety culture at sea.</p><p>  My Department's remit in this respect is generally limited to cases where there is an employer &ndash; employee relationship. Fishermen very often work on a profit sharing basis and as such are not deemed to be employees. I am aware of the contention that there are illegal workers operating in the industry. In terms of employees working illegally, this can arise where there is an employer-employee relationship and where the employee requires, but does not hold, an employment permit, or where an employee has not been granted permission to reside in the State by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  In this respect, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality informs me that from an immigration perspective all non-EEA national migrants, whether working or not, must have the appropriate permission to be in the State. While there may be atypical elements to the situation where the person spends much of their time at sea, the general principle still applies. The Minister further points out that because a person may elect not to abide by the rules does not imply that the onus is on the State to regularise - far from it.  However, any migrant who is in the State in breach of immigration laws may apply to the immigration authorities for permission to be in the State and would be strongly advised to do so. Such applications would have to be considered on their individual merits rather than as a class but it can never be to the non-EEA national's advantage to endure exploitative working conditions for fear of possible deportation.</p><p>  My Department wishes to satisfy itself that it is fulfilling its functions where they may relate to the issue of worker safety at sea and the enforcement of employment rights. In the case of my Department, while its remit in this respect is limited to cases where there are employer &ndash; employee relationships there may be potential for my Department to contribute to the overall response. Therefore, I will be writing to my colleagues the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister for Justice and Equality offering my Department&rsquo;s support and assistance in any cross Government process whereby the State seeks to apply better regulation to this sector for the benefit of those who work within it.</p></reply>

In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. This is given particular emphasis in respect of client companies in Kerry, who are located outside of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main Gateway locations.</p><p>  The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructure solutions is a key aspect in developing regional value propositions and in attracting FDI. In this regard IDA Ireland will continue to market all available land and buildings in County Kerry and work with local authorities and property developers to deliver appropriate solutions in response to potential investors&rsquo; needs.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region. The Gateway locations in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork. However, IDA Ireland also highlights the opportunities provided by other locations such as the linked hubs in County Kerry of Killarney and Tralee, which are within commuting distances of the Gateways of Limerick and Cork.</p><p>  In 2012 I attended a briefing meeting on the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 in Tralee, along with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan and all of the relevant enterprise support agencies. The schedule of Action Plan for Jobs 2013 briefings has not yet been finalised, but it is hoped that another meeting can be facilitated in Tralee as part of that schedule.</p><p>  I am mindful, also, that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014, when IDA Ireland's current strategy is implemented. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p><p>  Meanwhile IDA's commitment to delivering business to County Kerry continues and, while globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, there are still investment opportunities in global markets. IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs in 2013 as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

Construction costs and rental costs for both office and industrial space have fallen dramatically for new businesses, since the collapse of the property bubble. Rental costs for new leases of office space in Dublin, for example have decreased by 45 per cent between 2007 and 2011. Of course, I recognise that many existing businesses are tied into higher property costs having purchased or leased property with upward only rent review clauses during the property boom.</p><p>  The Government has taken steps to address the issue of upward only rent reviews where possible. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property. I understand that by the end of 2012, NAMA had received 276 eligible applications for rent abatement and had granted 212 applications with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications were under review.  Of the 276 eligible applications received, only 8 were refused. Other property related costs such as stamp duty on transactions have recently been reduced. Local Authority rates have fallen marginally in the past three years and we will continue to encourage Local Authorities to exercise restraint in setting commercial rates and, where possible, to reduce rates.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific actions to be implemented to support a sustainable commercial property market. These include:</p><p>  - Ensuring that the commercial leases database is established and fully operational in 2013.</p><p>  - The completion of a review of the Rent Review Arbitration Code to consider the effectiveness of the code in resolving disputes over rent reviews, and the degree to which stakeholders are making use of the code and to</p><p>  - Enact and implement the Valuations Bill in order to accelerate the revaluation of properties for commercial rates purposes.</p></reply>

The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures which will support the retail sector, including an initiative to introduce a single portal for business licence applications, a new scheme to help more businesses to trade on-line, and the integration of local business supports into a stronger Local Enterprise Office network to improve provision for micro and small enterprises.  Additionally, the Government has committed to strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance, which can often be a problem for retail outlets.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has undertaken to review activity in the report published in 2012 by the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) which identified actions, projects and activities undertaken by Local Authorities which can be seen to contribute to local development, enterprise support and economic growth.  This action may also have relevance for the retail sector at a local level.  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  This Interdepartmental Group will be chaired by my Department.</p><p>  I am aware that the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation recently received a presentation from representatives of the retail sector on the impact that parking restrictions can have on retail outlets in town centres.  I will ask my officials to examine the paper on town-centre parking, in the context of the work of the Interdepartmental Group referred to above.</p></reply>

Donegal's industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity. Accordingly, IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing client base to encourage them to transform and expand their existing operations while actively encouraging new investment in Donegal in knowledge based industries and high-end manufacturing, mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector. In October 2012 KeyedIn solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over a period of three years.</p><p>  The challenge facing IDA Ireland is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment.  International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase. Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated, professional and business support services. Consequently, when marketing potential locations for site visit to clients, IDA Ireland has to be credible and competitive in its approach, in the face of stiff international competition for FDI, as locations must meet the criteria of the client company in respect of skills, labour, site and/or buildings and infrastructure.  Donegal is part of IDA's North West Region, along with Counties Leitrim and Sligo, and this Region has two urban centres of sufficient scale - Letterkenny and Sligo- to meet these criteria.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has also assured me that it continues to focus on the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp;amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ), which aims to promote the linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.

In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. Employer and trade union interests have remained committed to this approach in the interest of the harmonious conduct of industrial relations for more than half a century. The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one. Institutions such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.</p><p>  The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. In this context, it is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.  Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding. Neither the Labour Court, not I, can compel a company or its employees to comply with such a recommendation. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties involved.  I have no plans to make any changes to Industrial Relations Acts which would compel either party to a dispute to accept a Labour Court recommendation in disputes referred under those Acts.</p><p>  With regard to employment rights legislation, I currently have discretion to pursue enforcement proceedings on behalf of claimants under certain employment rights enactments. This role is carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) on my behalf. Alternatively, individual claimants can take enforcement proceedings themselves or through their trade union.  In order to have credibility, a system of employment rights adjudication must be backed up by an efficient and effective enforcement regime. Therefore, there is a need for a robust method of enforcement of awards.</p><p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a root and branch reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services. The reforms which I propose to introduce will include improved measures to secure the enforcement of awards made by the State's Workplace Relations adjudication bodies.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will give legislative effect to the new Workplace Relations structures, has been approved by Government for priority drafting and I hope to publish this Bill during 2013.  As part of this Reform Programme, I propose to put in place a more robust method of enforcement of awards. It is proposed that there will be an Enforcement Section within the new structures that will implement the revised enforcement system, where the District Court will have considerable enforcement powers in relation to decisions of Adjudication Officers of the WRC and determinations of the Labour Court.</p><p>  I am confident that the measures which I propose to introduce in the Workplace Relations Bill will provide a legislative basis to facilitate the more effective enforcement of awards made under the reformed Workplace Relations adjudication structures.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains a number of measures that specifically support graduates and includes commitments to support graduates in specific sectors such as the food industry and ICT.  One of the ambitions outlined in the Plan is that, by 2018, Ireland will have the highest percentage of computing graduates as a proportion of all tertiary graduates.  That process will begin in 2013 through a process of increased programme places, reskilling and conversion courses, and through targeted migration of key skills groups.</p><p>  In the area of labour market activation, the JobBridge scheme operated by the Minister for Social Protection has proven to be very successful in providing opportunities for graduates to get valuable employment experience.  A recent review of the scheme, carried out by Indecon consultants, found that more than half of participants had gone on to paid employment after their internships ends.</p><p>  The Irish Research Council has launched the 2013-2014 round of its Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowships, including the Enterprise Partnership Postdoctoral Scheme and the International Career Development Fellowship. The Council facilitates the career development of researchers by funding those at an early stage of their postdoctoral career to associate with established research teams who have achieved international recognition for their work.  The Council aims to support an expertise-driven research system in order to enhance Ireland's innovation capacity and skills base in a rapidly changing global environment where knowledge is key to economic, social and cultural development.</p><p>  In relation to my own Department, amongst a range of programme offerings, Science Foundation Ireland continues to promote the study of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) disciplines, to ensure that graduates have the knowledge and skills to avail of opportunities in high value-added sectors. In addition, last week SFI launched a new initiative, the SFI Industry Fellowships programme, which in time should ensure that more research graduates are employed in industry. The SFI Industry Fellowships will also help to increase industrial R&amp;amp;D in Ireland, upskill Irish firms, assist SMEs to develop and grow, and help the IDA win new companies to Ireland.</p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates programmes such as Graduates 4 International Growth, which assists companies with ambitious growth plans in key markets to create one or more entry-level graduate market researcher positions.  Graduate market researchers work overseas for 12 months to complete a project related to the company's growth plans in the overseas market.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland also runs the New Frontiers<b></b>programme, which is an entrepreneur development programme delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology.  The programme provides successful applicants with a package of supports to help accelerate their business ideas and to equip them with the skills and contacts necessary to successfully start and grow their company. It may be of particular interest to new graduates.</p></reply>

When we launched the first in a series of annual Action Plans for Jobs in February 2012, I said that the transformation needed for our economy would not come through one big bang solution but through deliberate and determined action across all areas of Government and the private sector.</p><p>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs<i></i>process, we can see the evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. There were 270 individual actions committed to last year, to improve the operating environment and supports for job-creating businesses, and remove barriers to employment-creation right across our economy. Over 90% of these actions were completed during 2012.  More importantly there has been a stabilisation in jobs numbers in the last six months and, last year 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, in particular in export oriented companies. The compares to the 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before this Government took office.</p><p>  As with 2012, employment retention and creation will continue to be our primary objective in 2013. I am confident that we now have a structure in place that can deliver the type of actions needed to continue supporting the transition underway in our economy.</p><p>  This year's Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The plan also includes seven Disruptive Reforms that the Government have identified as having potential to have a significant impact on job creation. In addition, the experience and perspective of the six industry partners, recently appointed jointly by myself and the Taoiseach, will prove invaluable as we take on these strategically significant challenges. This can only help us in achieving the vital task of growing our economy and getting our people back to work in increasing numbers and achieving the target of 100,000 more people at work by 2016.</p></reply>

The recently published Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; identifies a number of issues relating to transport costs in Ireland. Prices for transport related services have generally remained stable since 2006, with the exception of air transport which has increased significantly since 2010.  There has been significant investment in national transport routes over the last decade and this has led to significant improvements in connectivity for Irish enterprises. However a number of bottlenecks still remain. </p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of actions to review and update policies across different modes of transport to deliver an efficient and integrated transport system including:</p><p>  - Completion of the review of Ports Policy</p><p>  - Publication of Competition Authority study into Ports</p><p>  - Development of a new aviation policy to deliver competitive international access</p><p>  - Development of a land transport strategic investment framework to decide what investment will be required out to 2025 to facilitate easy access to markets and the mobility of the workforce.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s report makes a number of recommendations aimed at reducing transport costs, most of which come under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and / or the Minister for Finance. I will consult with my Government colleagues to see how these measures might be progressed. </p></reply>

Promoting entrepreneurship, attracting inward investment and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole of Government, national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State. The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  The Guidelines permit Member States to grant higher investment aid to these areas.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s current Regional Aid Map, the highest rates are afforded to the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region.</p><p>  The establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide micro enterprise support through the dissolution of the existing CEB offices and the creation of a new network of Local Enterprise offices (LEOs) will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to micro enterprises in the regions in question and nationally.</p><p>  Microfinance Ireland is providing support, in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 available to start-up, newly-established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.</p><p>  I understand from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, LEADER provides both direct and indirect support to enterprise start-ups and already established microenterprises in rural areas all over Ireland.  Since 2009, almost &euro;20m has been provided for direct support to enterprise in rural Ireland through the RDP.  A significant proportion of the resources provided through the RDP Training Measure, which has registered a further &euro;10m in expenditure to date, also provide indirect capacity building and mentoring support for rural entrepreneurs. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its 700 client companies in the region to support their growth in 2013.  To support the development of a pipeline of High Potential Start-Ups in the Border region, EI has the following initiatives in place:</p><p>  - The New Frontiers Programme, with funding of &euro;4.25m, in IT Sligo/Letterkenny and Dundalk Institute of Technology/DCU.</p><p>  - On February 15, 2013 the Government launched a &euro;200k Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start-ups and creating jobs and growth in the North East Region. Funding of up to &euro;25,000 per project was available under this initiative.</p><p>  - The &ldquo;Get Export Ready&rdquo; Programme encompasses a wide range of practical measures for early exporters focusing on export readiness, the importance of research, developing a value proposition and the skills of export selling.</p><p>  - Innovation Vouchers worth &euro;5,000, give small companies access to the vast knowledge available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies.  Since their inception in 2007, 485 vouchers have been awarded to companies in the Border Region worth a total of &euro;2.4m.</p><p>  I am confident that the measures set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the other initiatives in place, will assist the development of investment and employment opportunities in the Border Region and the country generally. </p></reply>

A further &euro;32.5 million of available funding is projected for 2013. For the years 2007 to 2008 no budget was available, and during 2009-2010 &euro;4 million became available.  At present, all calls and evaluations have been completed for the first 3 Work Programmes (2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012). However, there has been no Irish involvement in any of the PCP related actions in these calls. </p><p>  It is important to point out that FP7 funding is made available under a Call for Proposals, competitive procedure, amongst the 27 EU Member States and participating Associate Countries. It is also important to note that Pre-Commercial Procurement and Public Procurement of Innovative solutions are relatively new areas under FP7.  In fact, under this year&rsquo;s 2013 Call for this Work Programme, PPI instruments will feature for the first time, in anticipation of their wide-scale use in Horizon 2020 to fund innovation procurement. So, while in theory this funding is available to Ireland, in order to be in a position to avail of it, Irish research organisations must have the capability to compete in this particular area and must be successful in the Call for Proposals procedure.  </p><p>  In regard to PPI in the FP7 ICT and CIP Programmes, since this is the first year that PPI instruments will be implemented in CIP ICT PSP, the actual funding awarded to Ireland will not be known until July/August 2013, when this year&rsquo;s calls will have been evaluated.  The total EU funding available, for all Member States and Associated Countries in ICT PSP, for PPI Pilots and PPI related activities, for the 2013 Call is &euro;12 million. This is comprised of &euro;10 million for PPI Pilots, and &euro;2 million for Thematic Networks to prepare for PPI pilots.  </p><p>  CIP ICT Policy Support Programme is only one of three &quot;pillars&quot; of the overall CIP. Throughout 2013 Enterprise Ireland will also be engaging with CIP funding through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the primary instrument for the CIP programme.  As suitable calls arise, the EEN will be engaging with its client base.   One very concrete benefit to Ireland and SMEs from this programme is its joint funding of the Enterprise Europe Network, which is in the region of &euro;450,000 per year.</p><p>  Ireland was not represented at the Pre-commercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI) Conference in Berlin, on 21 &ndash; 22 March, 2013 which was co-organised by the European Commission and the Federal Minister of Economics and Technology and regional Ministries of North Rhine-Westphalia.</p></reply>

However, where a client company elects to participate in knowledge events or to commission specific research in the field EI will charge a contributory fee.  The fact that such activities are subsidised by Enterprise Ireland renders it a support to a business rather than a charge.  Examples of events where Enterprise Ireland client companies contribute to overall costs include the following:</p><p>  - <b>Client Management Development</b> - In partnership with international and Irish business schools, Enterprise Ireland has put in place a number of programmes that assist companies to builds skills and competencies, grow their businesses and develop their export potential.  The general rule in these cases is that Enterprise Ireland will cover 70% of the costs of the company if it is an SME and 50% of the costs if it is a large company.  The balance of the cost is covered by the company.</p><p>  - <b>Participation on an Outward/Trade Mission</b> - A mission participation fee of &euro;500 is sought per participating company. The fee represents a contribution toward receptions, group transport/transfers and administration. Additional costs may be levied directly to the client depending on the specifics of the trade mission.</p><p>  - <b>Participation at Trade Fairs</b> - Enterprise Ireland seeks to recoup 50% of the total gross costs (floor space, design and construction costs and any additional costs of client companies' participation on the stand) of the space they occupy or benefit from.  Enterprise Ireland pays 100% of the space it occupies on the stand.</p><p>  County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support micro enterprises through direct grant aid and training and support measures - the latter being subsidised by the Boards.  The Board may charge fees to clients for participation in their training or mentoring programmes.  Whilst these charges are based on a number of factors - such as trainer costs - the CEBs will always consider the participant's ability to pay.  If the participant is unemployed, the Board may decide to waive the fee.  CEBs also provide a facility to pay by way of installments.  Fees for specific interventions such as the National Mentoring Scheme provide for a fixed rate of payment to the mentor.  Management Development courses are usually offered through a package of interventions.  These include various training elements at a set fee. </p><p>  The two Enterprise Agencies who report to my Department and who have significant property portfolios, namely IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, have confirmed that, where businesses are in difficulties, they have, on a case by case basis, responded to and facilitated companies' requests for reduced rent and will continue to do so.  I can assure the Deputy that the Enterprise Development Agencies continually seek to keep fees to a minimum. </p></reply>

As I have pointed out previously to the House, achieving this target requires a transformational change to our economy.  This Government, when it came into office, was starting from a position where more than 250,000 private sector jobs had been lost in the previous three years. This was primarily the result of relying, for a number of years, on economic growth fuelled by a property price and construction sector bubble. </p><p>  The new economy which we need to build must be based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  The transformation which we need to bring about will require progress on a number of fronts, including fixing our banking systems, reforming the public sector and embedding a jobs agenda across Government through the Action Plan for Jobs.  Key areas which I have been working on directly to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance, and supporting innovation.  Details of progress on these measures are available in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan for Jobs which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  This is a huge task, but we are making progress. We are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables again; our exports are at record high levels, not even seen at the peak of the boom; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best years for jobs growth in 2012 for ten years and five years respectively and overall, the level of private sector employment is stabilising.</p><p>  While these signs of recovery are welcome there is much more to be done to get more of our people back to work. That is why the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is more ambitious than the 2012 Plan and it introduces the idea of Disruptive Reforms, seven significant projects that require cross Government collaboration that can make a real difference to enterprise and jobs. The goals attached to them are ambitious in nature and they have aggressive timescales in which they will be delivered. They will also require new ways of working.</p><p>  We are making real progress, but I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge that still faces us.  As a small open economy, we are influenced heavily by the challenging developments in international markets.  However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.</p></reply>

Germany is Europe&rsquo;s largest economy and one of Ireland&rsquo;s top-4 trading partners. In 2012 Irish goods exports to Germany, at over &euro;7.5billion, were up 20% on 2011. Germany is also the world&rsquo;s third-largest source of tourists to Ireland, with over 400,000 German tourists visiting Ireland in 2012. </p><p>  My St Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme focused on building on the strong relationships that exist already, further grow our exports and create the jobs we need. My programme included:</p><p>  - 9 bilateral meetings with IDA and Enterprise Ireland target companies</p><p>  - A trade/investment event with over 100 companies</p><p>  - 5 Irish tourism/cultural events</p><p>  - 2 Bord Bia events to promote Irish food exports</p><p>  - Interviews with German media as part of the continuing drive to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s reputation</p><p>  I am confident that this jobs focused trade and investment-related programme has helped Enterprise Ireland clients cement relationships with their German partners and win access to key decision-makers in target sectors which should facilitate employment growth. It has also helped German investors to continue to see Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment and further expand operations and employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

The application was made through the Passport Express service which is a ten working-day service for properly completed applications.   Under this service, the Department was obliged to issue a passport to the applicant no later than 5 April, 2013 if the application was in order. The first of these related to the lack of documentation to demonstrate the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship, which is a primary requirement under the Passports Act, 2008. The second concerned the incorrect completion of the declaration section of the application form by one of the applicant&rsquo;s parental guardians.</p><p>  The Department rang the applicant&rsquo;s father on 5 April to inform him of these problems.  He was advised of the additional documents which were needed to resolve the citizenship problem.  He was also told that a new completed and correctly declared form and new witnessed photographs were required.  These were brought to the Passport Office in Balbriggan on 12 April, 2013.  The additional information and the new form were sufficient to issue a passport.  However, there was not sufficient time to enter this new material into the automated passport system to produce a full passport that day.  An emergency passport was, therefore, issued to the applicant in order to facilitate the family&rsquo;s travel plan for 15 April, 2013. </p><p>  In the meantime, the application has been finalised and a passport has been produced.  The Passport Office in Balbriggan has made further contact with the applicant&rsquo;s parents to arrange the return of the valid emergency passport for cancellation and the issue of the applicant&rsquo;s full passport.</p></reply>

The remainder consisted of development contributions made through other Government Departments, and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  Funding under the Government&rsquo;s aid programme was provided for long term development programmes and emergency humanitarian assistance in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world.  In 2012 the programme continued to prioritise the fight against global poverty and hunger, delivering targeted investments in the areas of education, health, good governance, food security and nutrition.</p><p>Funding under Vote 27 was delivered through trusted partners including UN Agencies, International Development Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and Irish Missionary Organisations.  The table below provides a listing of grants in excess of &euro;1.0 million provided to those organisations from the Department&rsquo;s headquarters in 2012.  In addition, approximately one third of the Irish Aid programme was managed through our Embassies in Programme Countries, where we implement long term, strategic development partnership programmes.  In 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s Programme Countries were Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa, and Timor Leste and Vietnam in Asia.  Full details of this expenditure are currently being compiled for the Irish Aid annual report and will be available later in the year on the Irish Aid website, at www.irishaid.ie.</p><p><table><tr><th>Organisation Name </th><th>In &euro; Millions  </th></tr><tr><td>United Nations Development Programme </td><td><div>     30.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Concern Worldwide</td><td><div>     23.43 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tr&oacute;caire </td><td><div>     18.47 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The World Bank </td><td><div>     10.39 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Misean Cara </td><td><div>     16.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>GOAL</td><td><div>     14.70 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Children's Fund - UNICEF</td><td><div>     10.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</td><td><div>     11.80 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Food Programme </td><td><div>     11.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund</td><td><div>     10.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Committee of the Red Cross  </td><td><div>       8.80 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees </td><td><div>       8.40 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East</td><td><div>       6.34 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Labour Organisation</td><td><div>       5.95 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs </td><td><div>       4.56 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  - UNAIDS </td><td><div>       3.48 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Oxfam Ireland </td><td><div>       3.30 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies </td><td><div>       3.28 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Population Fund </td><td><div>       3.23 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Christian Aid Ireland </td><td><div>       4.02 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Plan Ireland </td><td><div>       3.02 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Self Help Africa </td><td><div>       2.90 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization </td><td><div>       2.75 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Vision Ireland </td><td><div>       2.73 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Fair Trade Network</td><td><div>       2.66 </div></td></tr><tr><td>World Health Organisation </td><td><div>       2.30 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International AIDS Vaccine Initiative</td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>International Fund for Agricultural Development </td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Medicines for Malaria Venture </td><td><div>       2.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</td><td><div>       1.95 </div></td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women</td><td><div>       1.73 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Halo Trust</td><td><div>       1.64 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sight Savers International </td><td><div>       1.57 </div></td></tr><tr><td>M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res</td><td><div>       1.03 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This decision was taken in light of the political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar/Burma since 2011 in the process of democratisation, and further to the Council&rsquo;s decision to suspend sanctions in April 2012.  Member States and nationals of Member States are prohibited from the sale, supply, transfer or export of arms and related materials to Myanmar/Burma.  EU Member States are also prohibited from financing or providing financial assistance to military activities in Myanmar/Burma.</p><p>  Ireland and our EU partners recognise that Myanmar/Burma still faces complex challenges in terms of democratisation, economic development, human rights, and peace and reconciliation.  In keeping with this, the recent decision taken at the Foreign Affairs Council will apply until the 30 April 2014.  The decision will be kept under constant review and shall be renewed, or amended as appropriate. </p></reply>

However, when I became aware of the misappropriation of Irish funds in October 2012, I immediately suspended over &euro;16 million of assistance which was due to be channelled through Government of Uganda systems.  The final outturn for the Uganda aid programme in 2012 was &euro;15.54 million.  An interim Aid Programme for Uganda has been put in place for 2013 with a budget of &euro;16.4 million. This programme is built around support for projects which operate through non-government systems, most of which involve the continuation of existing programmes and commitments, together with some elements where existing support through Government systems can be replaced with bilateral arrangements.  This includes direct support to the Ugandan Office of the Auditor General.</p><p>  The promotion and safeguarding of human rights, particularly those of minority groups, is a central element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  I share the widespread concerns about the difficult situation faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Uganda. I am particularly concerned about developments in relation to the so-called Anti-Homosexuality Bill.  Ireland, together with our EU partners and other international donors in Uganda, has engaged actively on the issue of this draft legislation since it first arose in 2009.  The draft Bill was re-introduced in 2012, but has not yet been formally tabled in Parliament. The position of the Government of Uganda on the proposed law is that it was presented as a private member&rsquo;s bill and is not part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  President Museveni and the Cabinet have publicly stated that the Bill is unnecessary.  He has also made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&rsquo;s international relations and reputation.  </p><p>  I raised the issue directly with President Museveni when I visited Uganda last July and our Ambassador in Kampala has also continued to follow developments closely.  She and other EU Ambassadors have outlined our serious concerns in several meetings at the highest levels in Uganda.  The Ugandan Government and other interested parties are in no doubt about the Irish Government&rsquo;s profound concerns on this issue.  Ireland, in conjunction with our EU partners and the wider donor community, remains committed to ensuring that citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor the issue closely over the coming months and to work with partners who are equally concerned to promote respect for these rights.</p></reply>

It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  The Bill is a very positive development which, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  </p><p>  Both of these issues have been a key focus of my ongoing engagement with political leaders in the US, particularly during my visit to Washington D.C. over St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when I discussed them with Ireland&rsquo;s key friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  The Government has maintained close contact since publication of the Bill with the key players through our Embassy in Washington.  I am conscious that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system and that much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any overall legislation becomes clear. </p><p>  The plight of the undocumented remains a top priority for Government and we have worked closely with the bi-partisan group of Senators and other legislators in the run-up to the publication of this Bill.  The Government will continue to liaise closely with them and other key stakeholders in Congress and throughout the Irish-American community.</p></reply>

Over 2 million Syrians are displaced inside the country, their homes and communities destroyed and uninhabitable. More than 1.3 million people are now taking refuge in neighbouring countries after fleeing the hostilities. Despite serious risks and constraints on their operations, humanitarian workers are entering into these Syrian communities each day to reach the most vulnerable with life-saving assistance. </p><p>  Children have been particularly affected by the crisis. It is estimated that some 2 million children inside Syria are in need of immediate assistance, with many requiring medical attention and psychosocial support. More than 4,000 schools have been destroyed or are no longer operational, and hundreds of thousands of children are being denied a basic education. One out of every two refugees from the conflict is a child.  </p><p>  When I visited al-Zaatari refugee camp on the Syria-Jordan border last August, all the refugees I spoke to were clear that eland&rsquo;s assistance was greatly needed. Although Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, including Jordan, were making a major effort to support Syrians affected by the crisis, they were already under strain because of the scale of the challenge and the steady escalation of needs. Earlier this month, the T&aacute;naiste visited refugee camps in southern Turkey and witnessed the major humanitarian effort underway there to support Syrian refugees. This visit further confirmed our belief that the international community has a duty to move immediately to help protect the lives and dignity of the beleaguered Syrian population. eland has responded generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries.  To date, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided over &euro;8.15 million in humanitarian assistance.  This has been channelled through long-standing and reputable partners such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   They have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong strategies for targeting and delivery and robust systems for monitoring and accountability.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s humanitarian support is allocated through the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund managed by ish Aid. The specific objective of this fund is to save and protect lives in acute crisis situations on the basis of independently assessed humanitarian needs. It is designed to finance activities that provide protection for civilians, the delivery of clean safe water, sanitation services, food, shelter, healthcare, or other forms of assistance necessary to sustain life in natural or manmade disaster situations.  </p><p>  I believe that the ish people strongly support the provision of much-needed humanitarian support for people whose lives and livelihoods are being destroyed by the conflict in Syria.  We are continuing to monitor the situation in the region in order to assess the most effective way in which eland can continue to contribute to relief of suffering among the civilian population.</p></reply>

This does not, however, preclude the development of economic and trade relations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, sees the benefit of encouraging trade with Taiwan, and continues to explore appropriate opportunities which arise.  This does not, however, preclude the development of economic and trade relations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, sees the benefit of encouraging trade with Taiwan, and continues to explore appropriate opportunities which arise.</p><p>  As the Deputy has noted, IDA Ireland had an office in Taipei but closed it following a reorganisation of resources in 2011.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA currently assess that, given the competing demands on limited resources, they can best manage the needs of their clients in China, including those in Taiwan, from their offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzen.  Decisions regarding the presence of an Irish State Agencies in Taipei are matters for the Agencies concerned.</p><p>  The European Union has no formal diplomatic or political relations with Taiwan.  The EU does, however, recognise Taiwan as an economic and commercial entity and is represented by the European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in Taipei, which was established in 2003.  A number of EU partner countries also have Trade Offices there.</p><p>  Irish business and other representatives travelling to Taipei on trade promotion and investment activities are free to liaise with the EETO and to welcome any assistance which might be offered by that office, in addition to the support provided by the Irish State Agencies in China.  </p><p>  In terms of the possibility of concluding a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with Taiwan, this matter is currently being considered by the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Ireland has a DTA with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China which entered into force in December 2001.  Since the conclusion of the DTA with China, a separate agreement was agreed with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (HKSAR) and entered into force in February 2011.  However, the situation in Hong Kong is different to Taiwan as Hong Kong&rsquo;s separate taxation status is specifically provided for in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as adopted by the National People&rsquo;s Congress in Beijing in 1997.</p></reply>

The LPT is a self-assessed tax and it is incorrect to describe the general issue of LPT Returns and supporting documentation by Revenue as demands for LPT.  In accordance with the legislation, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the amount of LPT due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The level of household income, or the number of residents in the household, has no bearing on the amount of LPT due.</p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period. A system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers is available, one of which is dependent on the level of the owner's annual income. Where a property owner qualifies for deferral, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum and the deferred amount, including the interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  Details of all the deferral options are available in Revenue's Guide to Local Property Tax which was issued to property owners and to Oireachtas Members and is also on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of the general issue of Returns and booklets, which has been ongoing since last month and is almost concluded, property owners also received a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  Revenue has made it clear that the Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner's individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that the owner should pay.   The Estimate is only relevant where an owner does not make his or her self-assessment of the market value and complete and file his or her LPT Return. </p><p>  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.  An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. </p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p></reply>

I should point out that the latest OECD data indicates that Ireland has the most progressive tax system of the EU members of its organisation. A progressive taxation system ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.</p><p>  In addition, the marginal tax rate, which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base, is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more.  The OECD in its working paper &amp;#8216;Tax and Economic Growth'  points to the <i>&#8220;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&#8221;</i>  .  </p><p>  The top marginal tax rate for employees, including USC and PRSI, is now 52%. This has increased from 43.5% in 2008. The top marginal tax rate for self-assessed is now 55%. This has increased from 46.5% in 2008.  It is estimated that in 2013, the top 5 per cent of income earners will pay 44 per cent of the total income tax yield, while it is estimated that those earning &euro;50,000 or less, which represents 78 per cent of income earners, will pay 20 per cent of the total income tax yield.

Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. Revenue have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of all illegal trade, including drugs, and they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staff reductions, that this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  Revenue is very aware that it plays a frontline role in protecting society from the importation of illicit drugs. As a stakeholder in the Government's National Drugs Strategy, Revenue plays an important role in implementing the Supply Reduction Pillar.  Strategic and Operation Plans, which are managed on a national basis, have been put in place to ensure Revenue meets its commitments under the strategy. This ongoing commitment is bolstered by the deployment of the two Revenue Customs Cutters, the <i>RCC Suirbh&eacute;ir</i> and the <i>RCC Faire</i> , two X-Ray scanners and 14 detector dog teams, coupled with the management of the Customs Drugs Watch programme.  Revenue works proactively with an Garda Siochana and the Naval Service as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction.  Along with effective operational interventions, Revenue has also used its contacts within international law enforcement agencies to proactively profile drug trafficking networks.</p></reply>

The tax return should be used by the individual to declare all of their income sources, including payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  This obligation to file a tax return does not generally apply to an individual where all of that individual&rsquo;s income, including payments from the DSP, is taxed under the PAYE system.  In the case of a person taxed under the PAYE system, they are obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners of any other source of income, including benefit payments from the DSP.

Similarly, increases or decreases in the amount of payment made by the DSP should be notified to Revenue.

Fuel laundering imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, Revenue strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels in 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing requirement was introduced for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  In addition, Revenue introduced new supply chain controls requiring all licensed fuel retailers to make monthly returns to Revenue, from 1 January 2013, of their fuel transactions, which will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.</p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, over 2 million litres of fuel was seized, 20 fuel laundries were detected and closed and 89 filling stations were closed because they were unlicensed or in breach of licensing conditions.</p><p>  In view of the links between organised criminals and the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies.  A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, facilitates co-operation among these agencies in dealing with the illegal fuel trade.  Arising from its work, a number of groups operating in both jurisdictions and involved in the production and distribution of laundered diesel, have been targeted for investigation.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom are pursuing jointly a new and more effective fuel marker for common use in both jurisdictions.  A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed in 2012 by Revenue and HMRC and work on the project is proceeding.  A joint &lsquo;Invitation to Make Submissions&rsquo; (IMS), which issued in June 2012, generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated jointly at present by Revenue and HMRC on the basis of agreed scientific, legal and operational criteria.</p><p>  The question of introducing a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  A change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.  In addition, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.</p></reply>

A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue in this regard was the development of a register of residential properties in the State.  The register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources were cross-checked to ensure that the register is as accurate as possible.  The register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it.</p><p>  I am informed that, while every effort has been made to correctly match residential properties to owners, in a small percentage of cases the register contains duplicate entries for a single address.  Where a property owner receives a duplicate Return in respect of a single property it is important that neither of the returns is ignored.  The owner should file the correct return and advise Revenue of the duplicate either in writing or by contacting the Revenue LPT helpline at 1890 200 255.  No supporting documentation is required in order to remove a duplicate entry from the LPT Register.  I am advised that the property owner in question has already contacted Revenue and the duplicate property in question has now been removed from the LPT Register.</p></reply>

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>1.  An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>2.  An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p>3.  An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p>4.  An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.</p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income.  It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.</p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.</p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides two potential measures of relief from Local Property Tax (LPT) for persons who have a disability.  Section 10B provides an exemption for permanently incapacitated individuals while section 15A provides for a reduction in chargeable value for properties adapted for use by disabled persons.  Section 10B of the Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.</p><p>  Where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may in certain circumstances qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property.  Section 15A of the Act provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.

Since that date the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been paid a total of &euro;772,881 as follows: &euro;222,008 for 2011, &euro;408,920 for 2012 and &euro;141,953 so far for 2013.  The role of the Council is to provide an assessment of, and comment publicly on, whether the Government is meeting its own stated budgetary targets and objectives. It is also charged with assessing the appropriateness and soundness of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance and macroeconomic projections as well as an assessment of the extent of compliance with the Government&rsquo;s fiscal rules.</p><p>  To date the Fiscal Council has published four Fiscal Assessment Reports which have been very useful and a welcome input in advance of further budgetary decisions.  Their advice continues to inform Government thinking in the development of fiscal policy.  The Council is an important element in the reforms we are making to improve Ireland's fiscal framework.  Furthermore, the reports of the Council have helped to open up new avenues for a wider discussion on fiscal policy and performance.</p><p>  A detailed written response to the Fiscal Assessment Report will be included in the Stability Programme Update, and previously was contained in the Budget.  However, as I have said before, the real response to the recommendations of the fiscal council is not the words used in a particular report but the policy action the Government is prepared to take arising from the recommendations.</p></reply>

The standard rates of USC are: 2% on the first &euro;10,036, 4% on the next &euro;5,980, 7% on the balance.  Revenue records indicate that the income of the person in question exceeds &euro;10,036 per year and, accordingly, she is liable to USC.</p><p>  Occupational pensions and employment income are both subject to USC.  As the person in question has two sources of income, the USC thresholds have been allocated between both sources.  USC is deducted on a cumulative basis.  This means that deductions are spread out evenly over the year.  If the person in question does not have income from her home help job every week, then the threshold allocated will accumulate and be used on the next payday.  If, at the end of the year, the person concerned thinks she has overpaid USC, she should contact her local Revenue office for a review of USC deductions.  In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a review of deductions in the year 2012 and an overpayment of &euro;9.16 has arisen. A refund for this amount will now issue.</p></reply>

The appointment of the Special Liquidators is a compensation event under Regulation 8A(1) of the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 1995 (SI No. 168 of 1995) (the &ldquo;DGS Regulations&rdquo;).  The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for operating the DGS scheme.  The Special Liquidators were directed by the Central Bank to provide the necessary information and assistance to allow duly verified, eligible depositors to be compensated up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor.  I have been advised that in order to verify eligibility, the Special Liquidators must establish that there are no legal rights of set-off of deposits against other liabilities.  The Special Liquidators are continuing to work through the process of assessing these set-off rights.  The Special Liquidators are unable at this point to say when all cases will be resolved.</p><p>  In order to be eligible, a small company must be a private limited company satisfying at least two of the following three conditions in respect of the last two financial years: the balance sheet total does not exceed &euro;4.4 million; the amount of turnover for that year does not exceed &euro;8.8 million; the average numbers of persons employed by the company does not exceed 50.  These criteria are set out in Section 8 of the Companies Act 1986.</p><p>  In addition, the nature of the company&rsquo;s business must not fall within the excluded categories such as financial institution, insurer etc.  The Central Bank wrote to all companies that held accounts in IBRC, requesting directors to certify that the company qualifies to be treated as a small company.  The position as at 19 April 2013 was: Small Company Claim forms issued to company account holders - 774; Small Company claim forms returned - 124; Of which: Paid - 4; Being investigated by the Central Bank (e.g. unlimited company, dormant company) - 4; Still being assessed for right of set off by Special Liquidator - 116; No reply received - 650.</p><p>  The Central Bank will make compensation payments to eligible depositors at the earliest possible date (within five working days) following verification by the Special Liquidators.</p></reply>

On this basis, a number of providers, including BlackRock, were admitted to the framework agreement.  The most economic advantageous tender per lot (the company who scored the highest) won the immediate piece of work. The award notice was published on   <i>www.etenders.gov.ie/.</i></p><p>  As part of the FMP, the CBI is currently developing asset class loan loss forecast models which can be used as part of PCAR. As part of these services, these independent models will be validated by BlackRock (BRS).  In addition, BRS are developing the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) asset class model for the CBI. It is therefore expected that this engagement will be completed by end-June 2013.  The Framework Agreement is valid for four years.  For any future FMP or PCAR requirements throughout the duration of the framework agreement, each firm who has been successful in the particular lot will be invited to participate in a mini-competition if external providers are required.  It has not yet been decided whether third party support is required or needed for any stress testing that may be conducted in 2013.  Therefore it is not possible to provide an estimated cost of stress-testing the Irish banks for 2013.</p></reply>

It can only happen in very narrowly defined situations.  A person, whose mortgage on their home or on a rental property, for example, is partly written-off, will not suffer any income tax charge on the write-off. </p><p>  Since 1970, the income tax code provides for the write-off of trade debts to be treated as a receipt of income in the year of write-off. However, carried-forward losses in the trade up to that time can be set against that income and may well reduce the charge to zero.  This applies to all traders and professionals, whether in insolvency or not.  This year's Finance Act (section 18) introduced a similar provision relating to the write-off of loans used to acquire and develop land as part of a trade of land dealing or development. The new provision operates in the same way as the 1970 provision but is even more restricted in that it only applies to land dealers and developers.  From an income tax point of view, the consequences of debt write-off are exactly the same, whether insolvency is involved or not.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Commissioners, that within the past month, they have made it clear, publicly, that where for bona fide commercial reasons, a financial institution enters into a debt restructuring, forgiveness or write-off arrangement with a customer, then Revenue's approach is to accept that the financial institution is not intent on making a gift to the debtor and, consequently, no charge to Capital Acquisitions Tax will arise.  However, where the bona fides of such arrangements are open to question or tax avoidance is involved, then this approach does not apply.</p><p>  There are no<b></b>capital gains tax or value added tax implications associated with any benefit that might arise to a debtor from the writing-down or writing-off of a debt under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  In summary, I can say that in the majority of cases of personal insolvency, which may involve mortgage default on family homes and which will come within the ambit of the new Personal Insolvency Act 2012, there will be no tax consequences of any kind.</p></reply>

A total of some &euro;11.9 million in syndication fees was paid to the joint-lead managers and the co-lead managers of these two syndications. These are the standard fees for the issue of bonds of these maturities by syndication in the euro area sovereign bond market and are also, for example, the fees paid by the European Investment Bank which has a 'AAA' credit rating.</p><p>There were also debt expenses paid to the Danish National Bank, Swedish National Debt Office and the IMF in respect of EU/IMF Programme loans. The amounts were &euro;1 million, &euro;1.5 million and &euro;4.8 million respectively and made up the bulk of the remainder of debt expenses.</p><p>State savings expenses reflect the expenses associated with the State savings products such as Savings Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Saving Certificates, National Instalment Savings and Prize Bonds. An Post and the Prize Bond Company are agents of the NTMA in respect of these State Savings products. Payments of &euro;5 million and &euro;3.1 million were made to An Post and the Prize Bond Company respectively.</p><p>Expenses of the NTMA relate to the net funds drawn down from the Exchequer to cover the NTMA&rsquo;s administrative costs.</p></reply>

NAMA has entered into interest rate hedging which acts as an insurance mechanism to hedge its interest expense against interest rates increases over its lifetime.  NAMA's cost of funds derives from both the interest cost on its debt securities and its hedging cost.  NAMA's cost of funds will vary over the lifetime of NAMA, depending on the mix of its liability base, the associated costs of these liabilities and its hedging strategy.</p></reply>

Specifically:</p><p> - the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year;</p><p> - draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and</p><p> - the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented and published on Tuesday, 15 October this year.  The Government has also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by 31 December each year. This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement that it must be enacted within 120 days of the Budget. Under the new arrangements, the Finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the Budget.</p><p>  Following the Government decision on the timing of the budget, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering the follow-on implications of moving both Budget Day and the Finance Bill forward. However, the key change relates to the timing and, as I have stated before, it means that Government will have to make its budgetary decisions much earlier in the year. It is the intention of both Departments to keep all bodies that contribute to the Budget and Finance Bill processes fully informed of changes so that they can plan accordingly.</p><p>  There is another requirement in the &quot;two-pack&quot;, namely that the macroeconomic forecasts on which the Budget is based must be independently endorsed. Implementation of this requirement is still under consideration.  As regards documents to be published antecedent to the delivery of Budget 2014, the Stability Programme Update will be published by the end of April, as usual. It has been normal practice in the last few years to publish a medium-term fiscal statement or equivalent in October/November. As this overlaps with the new budgetary timetable, this is likely to be consolidated into the budget publication from now on.

One of the key requirements under the &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; which will impact on our budgetary process is that the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year. In light of this requirement, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented and published on Tuesday, 15 October this year.  The EU/IMF Programme for Financial Support does not include any conditions in relation to the Budget 2014 targets. However, Ireland remains in an Excessive Deficit Procedure, and subject to the relevant requirements under that procedure.</p><p>  As regards consultation, meetings take place throughout the year between my officials and those of other organisations, such as the NTMA, the Revenue Commissioners and other Government Departments, most notably the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Tax Strategy Group will also have a role here.  While specific plans for Budget 2014 have yet to be finalised, it is likely that I will meet personally, as I usually do, with a number of representative organisations. I would also expect to receive many Pre-Budget Submissions from a wide variety of groups and individuals; I received in excess of 600 prior to Budget 2013. These are recorded and distributed as appropriate, both in my Department and in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, so that their content may be considered by the relevant officials in the context of Budget preparation.</p></reply>

In the specific case of KBC Ireland, the bank is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Credit Institution in the Republic of Ireland.  In addition its parent, KBC Group, is profitable and has a strong liquidity position and the Group is currently providing the necessary capital and liquidity to its Irish subsidiary.  These are challenging times for the whole banking sector in Ireland, not just for the domestic banks. KBC Ireland is an important provider of credit to the Irish housing market and as the Deputy rightly points out the Bank has extended some &euro;14 billion of credit to the Irish economy. This is a very significant investment in Ireland, predominantly in the residential mortgage market.</p><p>  It should be noted that KBC Ireland anticipate that increasing economic stability will lead to more sustainable conditions in 2013 with the bank hoping for reduced credit costs in the year ahead.  I welcome KBC Group&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish market and note that they are planning to develop their business in Ireland further with new retail branches and distribution platforms to be rolled out in 2013 and continued expansion of their retail product portfolio.  This will add welcome competition in the retail banking market in Ireland.</p><p>  In the first quarter of 2013 the parent company invested &euro;125m in its Irish subsidiary to support on-going business development.  In April KBC Ireland opened a new high street retail office in Cork, which is its first new office outside of Dublin.  The Cork office, I understand, will employ 28 people initially and the Bank has said they have plans to open new offices in other cities during the course of 2013. Since 2011, employment numbers at KBC Ireland have increased from 521 to 650.</p></reply>

Nor can NAMA preclude debtors from engaging with such potential purchasers. To do either would be counterproductive and could stifle normal commercial discussions in the property market and in particular could discourage international investors from exploring acquisition possibilities in Ireland.  However, NAMA has very clear rules regarding the open marketing of loans or of properties on which it holds security.</p><p>  As set out in response to recent Parliamentary Questions on the topic of NAMA loan sales [44286/12, 44287/12, 44288/12, 44189/12, 1549/13, 8753/13, 8754/13], NAMA has adopted a very thorough approach in line with accepted international market best practice for the sale of loan portfolios.  As part of the formal sales process, potential purchasers are required to provide an undertaking that they will not engage with the debtor or other obligors at any stage during the sales process. Both debtors and potential purchasers are aware that the infringement of agreed protocols or undertakings may have an impact on NAMA&rsquo;s decisions as to whether and to whom it sells a particularly portfolio.  Furthermore, where NAMA approves the sale of any loan or approves the sale of any secured property by a debtor, it requires a confirmation that the purchaser is not connected to the debtor or other obligors.</p><p>  Having ensured, as far as possible, that the sales process is conducted on the basis of all parties having equal access to the necessary information at the same time and that such primary sales are not made to the relevant debtors or to connected parties, NAMA advises that it has no legal right to intervene in any further future management or sales of the loan or underlying property in question post disposal.</p></reply>

According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo; </p><p>  This press statement sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB have also stated that OMT may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme &ldquo;when they will be regaining bond market access&rdquo;.  The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is therefore a matter for the ECB.</p><p>  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.  I also note Mr Draghi&rsquo;s comments that one of the reasons why the ECB&rsquo;s OMT scheme is successful &ldquo;was because governments made significant progress in undertaking both fiscal consolidation and, in some cases, structural reforms.&rdquo; </p><p>  We are now in the final year of our EU IMF programme and our focus is now firmly fixed on a successful and durable exit from the programme.  The recent highly successful sale of long term bonds by NTMA is another very significant step in this process.  We continue to assess a number of options in this regard. However, we must respect the fact that the decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is an independent body.</p></reply>

There are clearly lessons to be learnt from this analysis of the decline of HBOS particularly as the Report makes it clear that to an extent its dramatic demise was &lsquo;an accident waiting to happen&rsquo; and it in this context senior management and the Financial Services Authority failed to follow through on the implications of its high risk growth strategy despite the fact that this was signalled as early as 2004.</p><p>  The Report clearly highlights failures at a number of levels &ndash; the senior management of the bank, the internal risk control, at the regulatory level and within the financial markets.  As set out in the Report in relation to the HBOS failure whilst structural and regulatory reform at national and European level are key to future financial stability it does not diminish the need for appropriate management and supervision of traditional banking activities.  The case of HBOS also highlights that prudential supervisors cannot rely on financial markets to do their work for them as neither the stakeholders nor rating agencies exerted the effective pressure that might have acted as a constraint upon the flawed strategy of the bank. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the situation in relation to the Irish banking system has been the subject of reports and analysis by Honohan, Nyberg and Regling and Watson.  The Government continues the process of addressing the regulatory failures of the past.  This week the Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Bill will be debated at Committee Stage.  This Bill further enhances the supervisory and regulatory framework under which financial institutions in Ireland will operate into the future.  Separately this will be complemented by the enhancement of the supervisory framework at the EU level, and as the Deputy will be aware, much progress has been made on this agenda during the course of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union.</p></reply>

The targets are set in relation to both Principal Dwelling Homes and Buy to Let mortgages.  Performance targets have been set for: ACC; AIB; Bank of Ireland; KBC Bank Ireland; Permanent TSB; and Ulster Bank.  The Central Bank has advised that these institutions cover the vast majority of the mortgage book in Ireland, accounting for around 90% of mortgages held and that it will examine whether it should extend the targets to other mortgage lenders in due course.  The Central Bank also continues to engage with all regulated lenders to ensure that adequate mortgage arrears resolution strategies are in place.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key protection for those cooperating mortgage holders who are in difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Code provides, inter alia, that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim, as far as possible, at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty having regard to the specific circumstances in individual cases.  In particular, the Code provides that a lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:</p><p>  - the personal circumstances of the borrower;</p><p>  - the overall indebtedness of the borrower;</p><p>  - the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS);</p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity, and</p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s previous history.</p><p>  The Code, which applies to all mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except Credit Unions, operating in the State, is currently being reviewed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The public consultation process has been completed and the Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code before the end of May.</p><p>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will also shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to formally consider and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  In the event of a refusal by creditors, the debtor will also have access to the reformed bankruptcy framework, which has significantly reduced automatic discharge period to three years.  I would also remind the Deputy that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long term forbearance option by the lender and a panel of around 2,000 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.</p></reply>

However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that Section 121 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 permits a mortgage lender to apply an early redemption fee in certain circumstances, which includes breaking a fixed rate contract. </p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated to me that when credit institutions provide fixed rate mortgages to customers, they utilise wholesale funding at a fixed rate to match the fixed credit they provide to customers.  If interest rates fall, credit providers may be locked into accessing wholesale market credit at a higher rate than they can charge consumers in the retail market.  As a result, a cost arises which is covered through the charging of a break cost. In the current environment, interest rates have fallen and as a result there is a differential between the interest rate that the credit provider has locked into for the funds supplied to customers and what they can charge to customers, for the remaining period of the fixed rate loan.</p></reply>

The end-March cash position benefitted from the front-loaded market funding undertaken in the first quarter of the year - some &acirc;7.5 billion was raised from long-term Government bond issuance in the first quarter out of a planned total of &euro;10 billion - as well as the proceeds of just over &euro;1 billion from the sale of Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes in January.  Funds in the Exchequer are used for all the ongoing payments necessary for running the State, which include debt redemptions. While the Exchequer had &euro;28.5 billion on hand in cash and deposits at end-March, there was a &euro;4.6 billion bond redemption on 18 April which has since reduced the cash position.</p><p>  The State earns a return on these cash balances and deposits, which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.  Notwithstanding the progress made in stabilising and improving the public finances it remains the case that the State will continue to run large, though declining Exchequer deficits in the coming years. For example, <i>Budget 2013</i> estimated the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 at close to &euro;35 billion. While the sale of the Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes, sale of Irish Life and the replacement of the IBRC Promissory Note with long-term Government bonds will help to reduce this requirement, it will nonetheless remain significant.</p><p>  In addition to these day-to-day costs and as referred to above, the Exchequer must have sufficient resources to repay debt redemptions, including the recent &euro;4.6 billion Government bond repayment on 18 April and a &euro;7.6 billion Government bond repayment in mid-January 2014. The continuing Exchequer deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.  Decisions on the level of cash reserves take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.</p><p>  The State is well positioned to have 12-15 months of advance funding in place when the EU/IMF Programme comes to a conclusion at the end of 2013, a level of funding which the Troika have noted in their recent reports on Ireland's progress in implementing the terms of the Programme of assistance. It is necessary, for reasons of prudence and to assure investors that they will be repaid upon redemption, that the Exchequer maintains a sufficiently strong cash position at year end.</p></reply>

This initiative required persons with undeclared tax liabilities, in respect of settlements on trusts and other structures, to make a disclosure and pay the related tax, interest and penalty liabilities by 31 October 2009.  Under the Code of Practice details of persons who made such a qualifying disclosure and paid the liabilities are not publishable in Revenue&rsquo;s quarterly list of tax defaulters.  Details of persons who did not make a qualifying disclosure but who were subsequently found, following investigations by Revenue, to have a liability, are publishable in the normal way in the list of tax defaulters, subject to the case meeting the criteria applying to publication as a tax defaulter.  One of the publication requirements is that the settlement is &euro;33,000 or higher (&euro;30,000 in respect of liabilities arising between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2010).</p><p>In total 94 people availed of the qualifying disclosure initiative and paid &euro;17.58m in tax interest and penalties.

This is also conditional on continued successful programme implementation being confirmed by the Troika together with the 9th review of the Irish adjustment programme and the 7th review of the Portuguese programme.  The 9th review of Ireland&rsquo;s programme has now completed all approval stages by both the IMF and the EU.</p><p>The Ministers also noted that the extension would smooth the debt redemption profile of both countries and lower their refinancing needs in the post-programme period.  The detailed implementation of the extension remains to be agreed. The effect of this will depend on the mix of loans extended and the maturities involved. This will be agreed between the NTMA, the EFSF and the EFSM.</p><p>Given the above, the table below (the information in which is available on the NTMA&rsquo;s website) shows only the existing maturity of EFSF and EFSM loans.  The bilateral loans are not affected by this agreement.</p><p>The interest rates for the EU facilities are already provided at or close to their cost of funds, and these rates are not affected by this decision on maturities.In terms of the EFSF, &euro;6.7 billion of Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans are at fixed interest rates which were based on matched EFSF bond/loan structures.  As a result of changes to the EFSF&rsquo;s structure which removed the direct link between specific bond issues and programme countries, the balance of Ireland&rsquo;s disbursed EFSF loans, currently &euro;5.5 billion, are part of a pooled system whereby all programme countries pay the same interest rate.  The pooled interest rate is calculated daily and is based on the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funds in managing the pool.  This can be characterised as the weighted average cost of its bond and bill issuance. As at 31 March 2013 the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans was 2.66%.</p><p>Exceptionally, Ireland has one EFSF loan tranche of &euro;1.27 billion which is considered to be part of the pool but has a fixed interest rate until February 2015, at which point it will roll at the pooled interest rate.</p><p>The effective interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans is based on the EFSM&rsquo;s cost of funds when it issues bonds. Such issuance is matched against the loans. Some of its matched issuance can be spread across both Ireland and Portugal.  As at 31 March 2013, the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans was 3.10%.</p><p>As at 31 March 2013, the overall blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s programme loans was 3.32%.</p><p><b>EFSF/EFSM Liabilities Outstanding at end-March 2013</b></p><p><pcenter><b>Liabilities outstanding at end March 2013 on EFSF/EFSM loans</b></pcenter><table><tr><th><div><b>Lender</b></div></th><th><div><b>Nominal Loan Amount*</b></div></th><th><div><b>Date  of Draw Down</b></div></th><th><div><b>Maturity Date</b></div></th><th><div><b>Term from Date of Drawdown</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)</div></td><td><div>EUR 5.00 billion</div></td><td><div>12-Jan-11</div></td><td><div>04-Dec-15</div></td><td><div>4.9 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.40 billion</div></td><td><div>24-Mar-11</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-18</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>31-May-11</div></td><td><div>04-Jun-21</div></td><td><div>10.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.00 billion</div></td><td><div>29-Sep-11</div></td><td><div>04-Sep-26</div></td><td><div>14.9 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 0.50 billion</div></td><td><div>06-Oct-11</div></td><td><div>04-Oct-18</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.50 billion</div></td><td><div>16-Jan-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-42</div></td><td><div>30.2 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>05-Mar-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-32</div></td><td><div>20.1 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.30 billion</div></td><td><div>03-Jul-12</div></td><td><div>04-Apr-28</div></td><td><div>15.8 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.00 billion</div></td><td><div>30-Oct-12</div></td><td><div>04-Nov-27</div></td><td><div>15.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b><i>EFSM EUR Equivalent Total</i></b></div></td><td><div><b><i>&euro;21.70 billion</i></b></div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div><b><i>12.4 yrs weighted average life</i></b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)</div></td><td><div>EUR 4.19 billion**</div></td><td><div>01-Feb-11</div></td><td><div>18-Jul-16</div></td><td><div>5.5 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 3.00 billion</div></td><td><div>14-Nov-11</div></td><td><div>04-Feb-22</div></td><td><div>10.2 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.27 billion</div></td><td><div>12-Jan-12</div></td><td><div>04-Feb-15</div></td><td><div>3.1 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 2.80 billion</div></td><td><div>03-Apr-12</div></td><td><div>03-Apr-37</div></td><td><div>25.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 0.48 billion</div></td><td><div>19-Jul-12</div></td><td><div>19-Jul-41</div></td><td><div>29.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>EUR 1.00 billion</div></td><td><div>23-Aug-12</div></td><td><div>23-Aug-19</div></td><td><div>7.0 yrs</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b><i>EFSF EUR Equivalent Total</i></b></div></td><td><div><b><i>&euro;12.74 billion</i></b></div></td><td></td><td></td><td><div><b><i>11.7 yrs weighted average life</i></b></div></td></tr></table></p><p>Notes :</p><p>Rounding can affect totals.</p><p>* Euro equivalents are translated at the reporting date exchange rates, taking account of the effect of currency hedging transactions.

The Act also provides that owners of multiple properties must file their LPT returns online.  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State.  This register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  The process to issue LPT Returns and supplementary information to the owners of in excess of 1.62 million residential properties has been ongoing since last month and is almost complete.</p><p>  However, LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  This obligation applies to all owners whether or not they receive a return form from Revenue.  They should contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT online at <i>www.revenue.ie</i> and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property Pin&quot; tab. </p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that Revenue has provided a wide range of payment options for LPT, including payment by instalments by direct debit or deduction at source.  The closing date of 7 May for paper filing of LPT Returns has been chosen with a view to the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment dates.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May is the de facto extension to the filing date for paper LPT Returns.  The online system is secure and user friendly, with built in calculators and easy access to guidance.</p><p>  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, the legislation provides that another person may file on their behalf, and Revenue has made it clear on several occasions that they can visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to e-file will be available.  In addition, Revenue has made arrangements for property owners to pay and file by telephone via the LPT helpline 1890 200 255.  To avail of this option, the caller needs their property details, PPSN and details of the bank account or other source from which they wish the payment to be deducted.  </p><p>  The requirements of a property owner to self-assess and file an LPT return even if he or she does not receive a form from Revenue, and the telephone filing arrangements, have been set out in national and local newspaper advertisements last week.  I am satisfied that this range of filing and payment options provides property owners with the opportunity to meet their LPT obligations, and I do not propose to extend the closing date.</p></reply>

It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a third rate of income tax of either 42%, 43%, 46% or 51% to be applied on the portion of taxable incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.  In addition, it is also assumed that the threshold for the proposed new income tax rates mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of the introduction of the new rates would be of the order of &euro;52 million, &euro;104 million, &euro;260 million and &euro;520 million respectively.</p><p>  However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2010, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. They are, therefore, provisional and subject to revision.  It should be noted that Gross Income is as defined in the Revenue Statistical Report 2011.  It should also be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs.  The imposition of transaction charges is at he discretion of the individual service providers.  I am advised that An Post levies a charge of &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone levies a charge of 75 cent per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.</p><p>  In regard to phased payments I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two other options available.  First, with effect from 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income, or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year in question.</p><p>  Second, phased payments can also be made by way of direct debit from the property owner&rsquo;s current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  In these cases the direct debit deductions will commence on 15 July 2013 and will be deducted on the 15th day of each month thereafter.  Normal direct debit fees charged by financial institutions will apply to these payments.</p></reply>

It is a more equitable charge and has a wider base and a lower rate when compared to the combined impact of the Income and the Health Levies.

Rather they are available, along with non-tax revenues, capital receipts as well as moneys sourced from borrowing to fund overall expenditure.</p><p>  Regarding the sections that benefit from the Central Fund, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the &ldquo;Revised Estimates for Public Services in 2013&rdquo; on the 17th of April.

Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders regulated by the Central Bank.  The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website www.centralbank.ie.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that as soon as a borrower goes into arrears, a lender must communicate promptly and clearly with the borrower to establish in the first instance why the repayment schedule as per the mortgage contract, has not been adhered to. A lender must pro-actively encourage its borrowers to engage with them about financial difficulties which may prevent them from meeting their mortgage repayments.  A lender must ensure that all communications about arrears and pre-arrears are provided to the borrower in a timely manner. All information relating to a lender&rsquo;s handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases must be presented to the borrower in a clear and consumer friendly manner. The language used in communications must indicate a willingness to work with the borrower to address the situation and must be in plain English so that it is easily understood. Legal jargon must be avoided, where possible. </p><p>  A lender must also prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its MARP and this must include:</p><p>  a) an explanation of its MARP, including the alternative repayment measures available to borrowers and outline in general terms, the lender&rsquo;s criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment measures;</p><p>  b) a statement that the borrower will not be required to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type;</p><p>  c) information about the potential availability of relevant State supports such as mortgage interest relief or Mortgage Interest Supplement;</p><p>  d) relevant contact points (i.e., the dedicated arrears contact points not the general customer service contact points); and</p><p>  e) reference to relevant website(s) operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 13 March the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank is also updating the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  Issues being considered in the review include:</p><p>  - New safeguards to ensure borrowers are given sufficient warning before being classified as &lsquo;non cooperating&rsquo;; </p><p>  - Changes to the contact levels permitted, while ensuring consumers are not subject to harassment; </p><p>  - Transparency on resolution options so borrowers have a full understanding before making a decision; and</p><p>  - Consideration on whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is more advantageous in the long term.</p><p>  Further information on the review is available on www.centralbank.ie.  The Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code before the end of May.</p></reply>

I have sought to re-assure property owners by publicly stating on numerous occasions that where they make their property valuation in an honest and reasonable manner, whether they base that on Revenue's own valuation guidance or some other means, that valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter. </p><p>  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) monthly report, &#8220;<i>The Residential Property Price Index&#8221;</i> , provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to property values where the only reliable comparable home values available to them are 2010, 2011 or 2012.  The CSO's report is designed to measure the change in the level of prices paid for residential properties sold in Ireland and is compiled using data on mortgage drawdowns provided on a monthly basis from mortgage lending institutions.  The report is based on the prices of properties that were actually sold and tracks percentage changes in values over time related to an index point set at January 2005.  It does not, however, show average prices.  Nor does it include cash based transactions.  </p><p>  The Revenue valuation guidance also uses the above CSO data to adjust for price changes in the interim.  Consequently, using the Revenue valuation guidance will give property owners average indicative valuations based on the property type, age and location on an adjusted basis and can be relied on to assist property owners in determining the appropriate valuation band for their particular property.  In conjunction with the Revenue guidance, the property owner should consider the specifics of his or her own property, for example, if the property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average property in the area, or is in a significantly poor state of repair and these factors should be taken into account in the owner's assessment of the valuation of the property.   </p><p>  The property price register details can also be used as a further source to help the owner determine the valuation band and this is the case even where the details from the prices register are potentially dated.  It is particularly so given that the majority of properties will fall into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band, which means that property owners are not required to provide a precise value for their property.  Therefore, if a person lives in a house similar to a house that was sold in 2010, applying the percentage reduction in property values for that area as set out in the CSO monthly Price Index report should give a reasonable basis for selecting a valuation band. </p><p>  I am satisfied that using the Revenue valuation guidance along with the person's own knowledge of their property and, considering these together with the property prices register, should allow the owner make an honest and reasonable assessment of the valuation band for their property.</p></reply>

Building on the 2011 &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo;, the Central Bank, under its MARS project, has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they can offer a range of longer term forbearance options to their customers who are experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Deputy will be further aware that, on 13 March 2013, the Central Bank announced additional measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks. This new approach is aimed at ensuring that banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.</p><p>  Performance targets have been set for: ACC, AIB, Bank of Ireland, KBC Bank Ireland, Permanent TSB, and Ulster Bank.  The Central Bank will also, over the coming period, set targets for the conclusion of durable solutions and for the sustainability of such solutions.  Arrangements will be put in place to audit and monitor progress made against these targets.</p><p>  The overall objective of this process is to ensure banks offer, where it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances of an individual case, durable and sustainable solutions to their mortgage customers who are in arrears.  In that regard, in addition to the existing forbearance arrangements such as term extensions or reduced payments that were being deployed, the Keane Report outlined other long term forbearance/resolution options such as split mortgages, sale by agreement, and trade down mortgages that could be utilized.  The Report also recognised that lenders could develop other possible options in this area for use by their customers.  The particular option suggested in the newspaper article would, in broad terms represent a payment holiday and extension of term for the borrowers involved.</p><p>  It should be noted that in the latest Central Bank statistics on mortgage arrears published on 7 March, under the Central Bank&rsquo;s own assessment of permanent resolution options, some 13,396 such restructures of primary dwelling homes were classified as term extension.  The new Central Bank targets and associated auditing requirement will provide additional information on such restructures over the coming months.</p></reply>

Properties under the control of receivers or other insolvency professionals appointed by NAMA are listed on its website at http://www.nama.ie/about-our-work/properties-enforced/.  The site allows for searches by both property type and country/area.  In each instance, information about the firm dealing with the insolvency and its contact details are provided. Potential purchasers are encouraged to contact the receivers to obtain additional information on specific properties and to submit expressions of their interest to purchase.</p><p>  In the case of property under the control of debtors, NAMA is precluded, under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, from disclosing confidential information. Confidential information is specifically defined to include information relating to debtors. Furthermore, Section 99 of the Act provides that, on acquisition of a loan, NAMA takes over the obligations of the participating institution under the loan, one of which is the contractual duty of confidentiality which the debtor enjoyed while still a customer of the participating institution. Information about individual debtors or guarantors is also protected against disclosure by the Data Protection Acts with which NAMA must comply as a data controller.  However, in cases where NAMA receives enquiries from potential purchasers about specific properties under the control of debtors, it can facilitate contact with a view to enabling sales transactions to take place.  </p><p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, as part of the Government&rsquo;s decision on 7th February to appoint Special Liquidators (SL) to IBRC, it was decided that NAMA would acquire those loans which have not been sold after the SL have completed their current valuation and sales process.  The SL is currently in the valuation stage of this process.  NAMA has therefore not yet acquired any loans from the SL, nor has it any sight of those loans, and all such loans remain under the management of the SL until such time as the sales process has been completed.</p></reply>

The reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to the supply of gas and electricity in Ireland.  The majority of EU Member States apply a much higher VAT rate to the supply of gas and electricity as EU VAT law provides that the standard VAT rate should apply to these services.  However, as part of a derogation to EU VAT law, Ireland is entitled to retain a reduced rate to the supply of gas and electricity on the basis that we applied a reduced rate to the supply of domestic fuels on 1 January 1991.  However, under this derogation the VAT rate may not be reduced below 12%.</p><p>  While it is possible, therefore, to reduce the VAT rate on gas and electricity to 12%, this would have to apply to all activity currently applying at the 13% rate, as EU VAT law does not allow the application of three reduced VAT rates. Such a move would cost around &euro;270m.  I have no plans to reduce the 13.5% rate as this would be costly to the Exchequer.</p><p>  While it is not possible under EU VAT law to make reductions based on the age profile of the customer, I would point out that the Department of Social Protection provide a household benefits package, which comprises an electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence to elderly people living permanently in the State.  In terms of domestic fuels, such persons can decide to receive an electricity allowance credit of &euro;35 each month or a gas allowance credit of &euro;35 each month.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The package is also available to carers. Customers under the age of 70 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and live alone or only with certain categories of people may also have an entitlement to the package. For those customers aged between 66 and 69 years and who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment, a means test must be satisfied to determine eligibility for the package.</p></reply>

All taxpayers are afforded the opportunity to pay their outstanding tax liabilities before any such liabilities are referred for collection enforcement action.  In the event that it is necessary to refer outstanding tax debts to the Sheriff for collection, I am informed that the Sheriffs make every effort to collect outstanding tax liabilities without utilising their powers of seizure.  However, in circumstances where seizure of goods is necessary due to non-engagement by the taxpayer, the Sheriffs are legally authorised to use their powers to enforce collection of outstanding tax debts.</p><p>  As I advised in my response to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question on this issue (No. 216 on 16 April 2013), Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, who hold office under section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945.  A Sheriff's debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 as amended, which allows that where necessary in execution of a warrant the Sheriff may enter any dwelling house or other building, regardless of whether the building is occupied or not, for the purpose of seizing goods, that are not exempt under the Act. </p><p>  Section 12 of Enforcement of Court Order Acts 1926 provides as follows:</p><p>  &#8220;(1) No action shall lie against an under-sheriff who has complied with the conditions hereinafter stated for or on account of his having entered or broken into any lands, house, close, or other premises for the purpose of taking in execution any goods, animals, or other chattels which were or might be on or in such lands, house, close, or premises, or for or on account of any injury occasioned to such lands, house, or premises by or in the course of such entry or breaking in.</p><p>  (2) The conditions hereinbefore mentioned are:-</p><p>  (<i>a</i> ) that before breaking into any dwelling-house or other building the under-sheriff shall make reasonable efforts to enter peaceably and without violence, and</p><p>  (<i>b</i> ) where the under-sheriff breaks and enters the premises of a person other than the person against whom he has been called upon to enforce an execution order, he shall either have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some goods, animals, or chattels of such last-mentioned person in such premises or he shall actually find some such goods, animals, or chattels in such premises&quot;.</p></reply>

There are currently over 4,700 such posts allocated to schools at primary level  and 777 posts at post primary level. This includes the standard  learning/language support allocation that is given to all schools and the  additional support that is provided to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary language  support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal  Boards.</p><p>  The need to reform the allocation of the General Allocation Model at primary  level arose because the existing system operated primarily on the basis of 2003  enrolments which are long out of date and had been criticised by the Ombudsman for Children. Schools now have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between  language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The  new single allocation for the General Allocation Model (GAM) and language support is based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year. This simplified approach to (GAM) will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.</p><p>  The allocation process for the 2013/14 school year is currently underway in my  Department and the staffing arrangements, including the appeals process, have been published on the Department website.  The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

At Primary level a teacher exchange scheme exists whereby a teacher may voluntarily exchange with a teacher in any other school.  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years.</p><p>  Within the redeployment arrangements at primary level there is provision for the most junior surplus permanent/CID holding teacher due to be placed on the panel to seek to be replaced on the redeployment panel by an alternative permanent/CID holding teacher in the school interested in going on the redeployment panel. If more than one permanent/CID holding teacher applies to be placed on the redeployment panel in place of the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher, the Board of Management will consider all applications from permanent/CID holding teachers. Where a Board of Management decides that the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher can be replaced on the panel, it will determine which applicant senior permanent/CID holding teacher is to replace the most junior permanent/CID holding teacher. The final decision to admit a teacher to a panel rests with the Patron.</p><p>  Redeployment arrangements for surplus post-primary teachers were introduced as part of the implementation of particular aspects of the Croke Park Agreement. The parties identified that voluntary movement, if provided for, could assist the operation of the main redeployment arrangements. A pilot voluntary redeployment scheme is currently in operation to assist in the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers in the Sligo area. This scheme is confined to schools in close proximity to the surplus schools in Sligo. This pilot scheme will operate only for redeployment in 2013.</p><p>  The above schemes are agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives from Teachers, School Management, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.  Any proposals by any of the Education partners to expand  the above schemes should, in the first instance, be raised at this Council.  </p></reply>

A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he/she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous 1 October. Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income.</p><p>  In recognition of the fact that a student under 23 yeas of age can be estranged from his/her parents, it is possible under the student grant scheme, as an exceptional measure, for such a candidate to be assessed without reference to his/her parents/guardians income or address.  However, compelling independent evidence of estrangement must be provided to the grant awarding authority to enable this. The type of independent evidence includes a letter from a social worker or other appropriate officer of the Health Service Executive explaining the circumstances of the estrangement.  Confirmation that a candidate is living separately from his/her parents/guardians is not sufficient.</p></reply>

The five year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs. The area in which the school, in question, is located has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth. In that context, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.</p><p>  All school building projects, including the project for the school in question, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the construction of a new school building for the school.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting access of minority denomination communities to schools that are of their tradition or ethos. The provision made by Kilkenny College caters for the needs of children from the Protestant community spread across several counties.  Accordingly, I was happy to have officials of my Department work with the college authorities to work through a basis on which such a transfer would be feasible if that was their ultimate judgement.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that over the course of those detailed discussions the College authorities shared information in confidence with the Department and while I wish to respect that position at the same I do want to provide the Deputy with information on the arrangements made to assist and support the College through its transition.</p><p>  Kilkenny College will cease to charge fees with effect from the start of school year in September next and as a result my Department will in future pay the salaries of a teacher for every 19 students attending the College. This compares with one teacher for every 21 students in fee charging schools at present and which will rise to one teacher for every 23 students in September 2013.  My Department will also provide capitation and related funding to the College on the same basis as every other voluntary secondary school within the Free Education Scheme.</p><p>  I approved specific transition arrangements in relation to the teaching staff employed by the College and also reviewed the level of exchequer funding approved by the Department for school building projects carried out by the College.  The precise cost of additional exchequer expenditure in Kilkenny College will be a function later this year of the actual enrolment in the College as a school within the Free Scheme.</p><p>  While the arrangements made in relation to Kilkenny College were specific to its circumstances and plans to enter the Free Scheme, I have made clear that my Department will engage constructively with any fee charging school that is considering how best to secure its future. On the basis of the analysis I published earlier this year on the income from fees available to fee charging schools I expect that a minority of the fee charging schools will wish to engage with my Department, as Kilkenny College did, in order to plan for the future.</p></reply>

At primary level the focus is on acquisition of the two national languages, Irish and English.  Beyond the primary level, the focus expands to include not only English and Irish but also other languages.  Post-primary builds on the foundation established at primary level by offering not only English and Irish but also a range of foreign languages. French, German, Spanish, Italian at Junior Cycle with the addition of Russian, Japanese and Arabic at Leaving Cycle.  Examinations are also offered in a number of other non-curricular EU languages for native language speakers from EU Member States.  Candidates presented in some 16 EU languages for the Leaving Certificate in 2012.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2012) will support schools in fostering practical language-learning skills.  It will give all students the opportunity to study at least one language in addition to Irish and English.  Revised syllabuses of modern foreign languages are scheduled for implementation in 2016.  Schools will also have the flexibility to offer short courses of 100 hours duration i.e. in a second language, including languages not currently offered in the junior cycle curriculum. The NCCA is currently developing a short course in Chinese, which will also be available to schools from 2014.</p><p>  A Transition Year module in Chinese was launched last year, having already been piloted by over 20 schools across Ireland.  For many years now, Japanese has been offered in a number of TY programmes, and has resulted in a follow-on uptake of Japanese to Leaving Certificate level, which in 2012 reached 239 students.  In 2012, over 30,000 students sat a European language for the Leaving Certificate, including around 26,000 in French, 6,700 in German, 4,000 in Spanish and 700 in Polish, with smaller numbers taking other languages such as Italian, Japanese and Russian and Arabic.  The Post-Primary Languages Initiative is broadening its remit to provide support for all teachers of modern foreign languages, through the provision of materials on its website. It was originally set up to offer support to schools who wished to introduce Spanish, Italian and Japanese and Russian.</p><p>  Prospective students have access to a wide range of foreign language courses at third level that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines across business, the arts, the humanities and the sciences.  A number of language programmes have also been selected for funding through the Springboard skills initiative which was launched in May 2011.  Preliminary data from the HEA research on the provision of foreign languages indicates that some 9,000 third level students are studying a foreign language.</p><p>  The EU's Erasmus initiative has played a key role in enhancing the language proficiency of Irish graduates. 28,000 Irish students have benefited from this programme over the past 25 years. Irish participation in Erasmus has risen significantly in recent years, including an 18% increase last year &ndash; the fourth highest growth in Europe.  While the education system can make provision for language, it is for wider society, including enterprise and communities, to highlight the advantages that studying languages can bring.</p></reply>

Springboard 2011 provided part-time higher education places for 4,956 unemployed people on 204 courses at certificate, degree and post graduate level. To date 2,460 participants have graduated from Springboard 2011 courses and 649 are continuing to a further year of study.  5,335 unemployed people have enrolled on 211 different higher education courses under the second phase of Springboard in 2012.  Graduation data from Springboard 2012 will be available in the summer.</p><p>  The evaluation framework for Springboard provides for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of outputs. A first stage evaluation report, which was published by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in February 2012 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1463, showed that Springboard has been very successful in reaching its target cohorts: 77% of participants were aged between 25 and 49, 60% had been out of work for more than 1 year and 20% had previously been employed in construction.  A second stage evaluation report was published in February 2013 and is available at www.hea.ie/en/node/1514. It shows that 30% of Springboard participants were back in work within 6 weeks of completing a Springboard course and that 40% were back in work within 6 months of completion.  Outcomes varied across programme areas and levels and by age and duration unemployed.</p></reply>

The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being.  The content of the Guidelines draw together existing elements and structures that are in place in post-primary schools - the SPHE curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan and the NEPS Continuum of Support Framework.  They provide clear evidence-based advice for schools on the effective and coherent integration of structures and systems to assist schools with the task of whole-school implementation.</p><p>  The Guidelines emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health.  This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships.  Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach.  Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.</p></reply>

All contracts under the Schools Broadband Access Programme were recently re-tendered under a public procurement competition.  As a result, the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 13 thereby increasing the range of service options nationally.  The best available service option is offered to each school.  These contracts were signed last summer and the migration of schools onto the new services is currently underway.</p><p>  The Department is aware of the difficulty that some schools, such as St Flannan's National School School have with their broadband service.  Through the public procurement process the Department has sought as far as possible to reduce the reliance on satellite services and in this regard the number of schools reliant on a satellite connection has fallen from approximately 1,800 in 2005 to approximately 160 at present.  Satellite connections and DLS connections of up to 1megabyte have only been awarded where no other solution was proposed and contracts for these connections have only been awarded for one year.  These schools will be re-tendered this summer and in the interim the Department will liaise with service providers to try and ensure that where possible improved connections will be made available.</p></reply>

In terms of extending freedom of information to all public bodies, the Bill will contain a generic definition which will enable FOI to apply to all public bodies unless specifically exempt.  On that basis, the Private Residential Tenancies Board will be comprehended by the generic definition contained in the Bill and will become subject to FoI under the new legislation when enacted in due course.</p><p>  It is intended that the Private Residential Tenancies Board, along with other public bodies not currently subject to FoI, will be allowed a six month period to prepare within their organisation for the application of FoI to its records.</p></reply>

The REV gives a fuller, more detailed breakdown of spending by each Department and Vote than the spending information announced in the Estimates which are published with the Budget each year.  The REV also gives the provisional outturn for spending in the preceding year and includes performance budgeting information for each area of Government spending. </p><p>  The REV 2013, published last week on Wednesday, 17 April, elaborates on the 2013 spending information published in the Expenditure Report 2013 at Budget time last December.  Individual Vote Estimates were also presented to the D&aacute;il and referred to the relevant D&aacute;il Select Committees for discussion.  The Revised Estimates set out detailed financial and output information for all Departments and it is important that select committees have the opportunity to examine this information and in particular the performance budgeting information and programme outputs.</p><p>  In keeping with the largely technical nature of the REV, the majority of adjustments arise from the allocation of savings around pay, pensions, conditions of service and reductions in public service numbers.  The estimates in Budget 2013 included some of these savings in individual Votes and also an undistributed amount that was yet to be allocated.  These savings have now been fully apportioned across individual Votes on the basis of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations.  A small element of the 2013 savings is non-Exchequer, non-voted or non-pay, so these savings will not be seen in the voted Exchequer pay total shown in the REV 2013. </p><p>  The overall savings arising as a result of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations would have achieved the required savings for 2013 and the full target by the end of the deal period.  I made a decision to publish the Estimates, which are based on the implementation of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations, because that is what we hoped the position would be.  The recommendations were the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required.  The Government will continue to reflect on last week's outcome of the ballot.  In the meantime, we have agreed to request the CEO of the Labour Relations Committee to make contact with the parties in the coming days to establish whether or not there is a basis for a negotiated agreement to meet the budgetary targets.  He will report back in time to allow for further discussion and decision by Government on the next steps.  Following that, any changes required will be reflected in the Estimates as appropriate and presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The Employment Appeals Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably, this has increased the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal. </p><p>  The tribunal itself has been active in ensuring that the resources allocated to it are used in an efficient manner and there is an ongoing review of how this is best delivered.  For example, divisions of the tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  Cases are assessed at the scheduling stage and those that are seen as requiring less time to conclude or are of a similar nature are streamed together in an effort to conclude as many cases as possible in as short a time as possible.  This is reflected directly in the increase in the number of cases finalised by the tribunal over the last three years.  These increases are as follows: 2010 + 30%, 2011 + 11% and 2012 + 13%.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the tribunal, I believe that the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five workplace relations bodies.  The reform programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier workplace relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  Work has commenced on the drafting of a workplace relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.</p><p>  The purpose of the reform programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes.  Substantial progress has already been made in this regard.  For example, the establishment of a workplace relations single contact portal from January this year has resulted in all complaints now being acknowledged and respondents notified within a matter of weeks of receipt of the complaint.  In some cases this was taking up to eight months.  This service enhancement increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  I understand that the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings has effectively been eliminated.</p><p>  The service improvements have also been underpinned by the launch from January last year of a single complaint form for all first instance workplace relations complaints.  A Pilot Early Resolution Service commenced on 14 May last year.  This service will provide the opportunity in certain cases for employers and employees to resolve issues without recourse to formal adjudication hearings, thus relieving pressure on adjudication services such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the EAT. </p><p>  The two tier model now being designed will deliver a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision-makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing with published decisions.  Finally, I also intend to provide for a more effective method of enforcing the awards of adjudicators.</p></reply>

I have been informed by that Department that its records indicate your constituent's full statutory entitlement to a redundancy payment has been met by his former employer.  If this is not the case then direct contact should be made with the Dept. of Social Protection in relation to this matter.</p><p>  You have also referred to a claim before the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) in respect of this matter.  Any claim that your constituent has made in relation to this matter before the LRC would in all likelihood be heard by a Rights Commissioner. The Rights Commissioner will, in due course, issue a recommendation and in circumstances where the recommendation relates to the Unfair Dismissals Acts, either party may appeal that recommendation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).<font color="#2F2F2F">  I</font>t is long-established practice that I, as Minister, do not get involved with the adjudication/mediation process and as such, you will appreciate that I can have no role in the handling or conduct of individual cases.  It would therefore be totally inappropriate for me to comment on the case concerned.  Should any issues arise regarding the progress or conduct of a case before the Rights Commissioner Service, information may be sought directly from the CEO of the LRC, Mr. Kieran Mulvey.</p></reply>

An employer who employs a 3rd country national requiring, but without, an employment permit is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation.  There is a careful balance to be struck. On the one hand there can be situations where an employee, unwittingly, falls out of the employment permit regime and the question then arises as to whether there should be a channel for them to regularise their position. On the other hand, such a provision should not serve to incentivise employers for not adhering to their legal responsibilities.</p><p>  I do recognise that occasionally 3rd country nationals, having entered the labour market legally, can find themselves, through no fault of their own, without the necessary permission to remain employed, or, having left the original employment in respect of which an employment permit was granted, are unable to re-enter employment. From time to time the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland brings such cases to the attention of my Department and in such circumstances, I may consider the granting of an employment permit on an exceptional and case by case basis. Applicants must set out in detail their particular circumstances explaining how they arrived at their situation and satisfy me that a refusal to grant an employment permit would cause undue hardship.</p></reply>

During 2012 employment increased by 7% within the ICT sector, by 12% within the Agri-Food sector and by 6% in professional, scientific and technical activities.  There is strong demand within the ICT sector here due to -</p><p>  - an expansion of the business operations of companies, inflow of foreign R&amp;amp;D investment and formation of new start-ups;</p><p>  - potential for foreign companies to win mobile investment from parent companies and the availability of high skilled personnel to enhance their business proposition; </p><p>  - emerging skills demands around cloud computing, service design, database management, social networks and media, development of e-commerce applications and internet marketing.</p><p>  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs and targets set for initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme have the ultimate aim of providing Ireland with the highest proportion of ICT graduates as a share of third level graduates by 2018.  New Sectors which are small in employment terms but which have experienced additional employment growth include clean/green technologies, creative digital media and content industries, marine and maritime and healthcare (eHealth) services.  Traditional Sectors where employment has shown recovery include tourism and hospitality, and also within the sub-sector of the construction industry which has focussed on business opportunities in the design and use of eco-construction products and materials and energy efficiency improvements in housing and buildings. </p><p>  As regards foreign direct investment, there have been substantial job gains in the high-tech sector within both new arrival foreign investment companies (such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) as well as from well-established businesses such as Paypall, HP and IBM. Indigenous engineering, software, internationally traded services and medical devices companies have also performed well in export markets.  The main skills sets in demand within these sectors are &ndash;</p><p>  - international management skills (e.g. export marketing, international marketing and sales, managing international customers and suppliers, etc.) </p><p>  - foreign language capabilities and cultural awareness (e.g. mainline European including German, French, Italian and Spanish, as well as &ndash; at a relatively lower level - Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic) </p><p>  - international sales skills</p><p>  - marketing &amp;amp; sales skills</p><p>  - science &amp;amp; engineering skills (including within the renewable energies sub-sector)</p><p>  - high-level ICT skills</p><p>  There are currently 1,848,900 people at work in the economy. As well as additional jobs that have arisen in recent years, it is important to note that there is a level of replacement demand in the workforce as people retire, take up home/caring duties, take up full time education, etc. This creates replacement demand estimated at 44,000 jobs per annum.</p><p>  Skills demands arise not only from within the additional jobs created but also within existing jobs as, in order to remain competitive, firms need to continually up-skill their workforces.  The main drivers of change impacting on the skillset requirements for these jobs include customer demand, new technology developments, product and market specific regulations and directives, and internal organisational change. </p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our workforce is well aligned with the skills that employers need now and into the future. As a country, we must continue to up-skill, not just for additional jobs but also in terms of existing jobs. This is vital in order to compete internationally as other countries are doing so.</p></reply>

Details of total employment and the number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies in each year from 2008 to 2012 are set out in the tabular statement.</p><p>2012 saw a strong performance in the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) won by Ireland with 12,722 new jobs being created in IDA client companies. This also represents a significant achievement in terms of reaching the target of 12,500 new jobs set in the Government&rsquo;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs. IDA Ireland has indicated that the gains made spanned a range of sectors, with particularly strong performances from social/digital media, IT, financial services and life sciences.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s concentration on attracting employment intensive services to Ireland is leading to the speedy creation of jobs.  A significant proportion of investments in 2012 was in the area of services operations, particularly serving the Europe, Middle East and Asia Market.  A notable feature of 2012 was the wide range of green field investments coming to Ireland. In total, there were 145 individual investments, of which 66 (over 40%) were from companies coming to Ireland for the first time.</p><p>In recent years IDA Ireland has established a presence in high growth markets, such as China and India, and remains committed to the goal of securing 20% of all greenfield investments from high growth markets by 2014.  The Agency has also broadened and deepened its portfolio, by including not just large multinational corporations (MNCs) but also working closely with &ldquo;fast growth&rdquo; companies, who aspire to be the MNCs of the future.  This strategy was successfully implemented in 2012 with a range of fast growing companies announcing that they had decided to invest in Ireland.</p><p>While the global outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, IDA has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p><p><b> Table showing Total Employment and New Jobs Created in IDA Ireland</b></p><p><b> Client Companies from 2008 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Employment Data</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2008</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2009</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2010</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2011</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Total Employment </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>152,514</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>138,171</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>139,760</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>145,878</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>152,785</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">New Jobs Created</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>6,719</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>3,568</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>11,224</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>13.068</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>12,722</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

It was clear what was needed was to transform our economy from one that became over dependent on property, construction and debt, to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key instrument in this objective and is designed to deliver measures right across Government to protect existing jobs and support the creation of new ones.  A key feature of the Action Plan process is that each of the actions to be delivered is broken down into Quarterly milestones and progress against these targets is rigorously monitored and published on a quarterly basis.</p><p>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs<i></i>process, we can see evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. Over 90% of the 270 individual actions committed to last year were completed on time.  They included many important reforms designed to enhance competitiveness, improve access to finance, support enterprise and develop employment in sectors of opportunity for Ireland.  In many cases, the full impact of these reforms will take time to materialise.  However, some significant objectives have already been realised, including:</p><p>  - the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small businesses;</p><p>  - the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme; </p><p>  - new supports for first time exporters; </p><p>  - the launch of a new Women-In-Business programme; </p><p>  - the simplification and extension of the Employer's PRSI Exemption scheme; </p><p>  - the launch of a National Broadband Plan;</p><p>  - the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub; and </p><p>  - work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, the Green Economy and other areas.</p><p>  More significantly, last year, 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, particularly in export-oriented sectors that are targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.  Exports from Irish-based companies also reached record levels last year.</p><p>  The Government will continue to build on this progress in 2013.  This year's Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The Plan also includes seven landmark projects, or Disruptive Reforms, that the Government has identified as having potential to impact significantly on job creation.  As a small open economy, we are influenced heavily by developments in international markets.  However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.</p></reply>

Innovation and technology are elements of a series of inputs which are requisite for a job to be sustained in commercial enterprise &ndash; i.e. companies need to identify markets to sell their goods and services, they need to have finance in order to invest in capital and human resources, they need to put in place the delivery and production capacity which meets their customers&rsquo; needs, and they need to focus on the development of new and improved products, processes and services which can ably compete in international markets.  </p><p>  While some jobs are created in research organisations arising from direct participation in EU Framework Programme projects, the main benefit arising from participation is that it offers valuable opportunities to companies of all sizes based in Ireland to participate in high-quality research collaborations with their European counterparts, with the support of EU funding. Collaborative Research forms the core of the FP7 programme, fostering collaborative research across Europe through transnational consortia of industry and academia. </p><p>  FP7 participation enables companies to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.  The experience and the knowledge gained by Irish companies from transnational collaboration often translates into company expansion, creating new jobs, at a later stage. However, as previously stated, innovation and technology are only some of the elements required for sustainable job creation. </p><p>  Through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s facilitation and financial support Irish companies and academic researchers secured in the region of &euro;85 million in 2011, and approximately &euro;95 million in 2012.  Since FP7 commenced in 2007, Ireland&rsquo;s researchers, research organisations and companies have been involved in more than 1,500 successful applications obtaining European Commission funding of approximately &euro;485 million.  The overall Irish success rate, at 22.7%, is above the European Member State average of 22.1%, and a very positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation over the lifetime of FP7, and is in line with our national targets.  </p></reply>

In the majority of cases involving relocation, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s experience is that the shift is to lower cost emerging economies, with a smaller number of companies relocating to other developed country locations, largely in Eastern Europe.  Some of the job losses are due to cyclical factors, however, and will recover. Consequently, in addition to winning new foreign direct investment (FDI), IDA Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to retain existing clients, improve the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland and secure greater economic impact from such investments.</p><p>  I am delighted to say that 2012 was a particularly good year for job creation in Agency supported companies, with IDA client companies creating a total of 12,722 gross new full time jobs (6,750 net new jobs).  The IDA client base in Ireland now employs 152,785 people, a level last recorded before the global financial crisis began in 2008.  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in 2013, investment in key global markets are slowing down, particularly in Europe.  There are, however, opportunities for growth in the IT/technology sector, in specific areas of financial services, in life sciences, and in social/digital media. To date, in 2013, IDA Ireland job announcements include: Vistakon - 300 jobs; Ebay - 450 jobs; Facebook - 150 jobs; Yahoo - 200 jobs; FireEye - 100 jobs; Nypro - 200 jobs.</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to attract such projects to Ireland, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.</p></reply>

Ireland is already rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to go out and compete on global markets.  For example, Ireland has moved up to 20th place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 and is also ranked 15th in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2012 Report.</p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops global competitiveness rankings, including: </p><p>  - business impact of rules on foreign direct investment; </p><p>  - inflation;</p><p>  - FDI and technology transfer; </p><p>  - availability of skilled labour; </p><p>  - flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and </p><p>  - investment incentives.</p><p>  We are making progress on the jobs front through the Action Plan for Jobs process, which is systematically transforming the operating environment for business, improving our competitiveness and supporting companies increasing employment.   </p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies created almost 10,000 net new jobs between them, representing the strongest performance for the IDA in a decade and the best performance in over five years for Enterprise Ireland.  There was a good regional spread in these new jobs, including new investments in Letterkenny, Sligo, Westport, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Limerick, Kildare and Wexford.  The latest QNHS figures show that overall, employment in the economy increased by 1,200 people year-on-year to the end of 2012.  This was the first increase in employment since the second quarter of 2008 and is in stark contrast to a situation where the economy was losing an average of almost 90,000 jobs per year in the period 2008 to 2011.  Meanwhile, we are also showing that we can compete on international trade markets, as our total exports in 2012, at over &euro;182 billion, were at their highest level ever.</p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that we are moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy. The Forf&aacute;s report advises that over half of recent cost competitiveness gains are attributable to favourable exchange rate movements. The report also indicates that upward price pressure is beginning to emerge in some areas, while rigidities continue to persist within the economy.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes a range of concrete measures to address issues highlighted in the report in relation to labour costs, property costs, business services and broader consumer costs.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s broader agenda to enhance productivity, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in the world to do business.</p></reply>

That policy has proved to be particularly successful as, at the end of 2012, there were 152,785 people employed in over 1,000 IDA client companies which, in turn, result in another 100,000 spin off jobs in the Irish economy. The net effect is that 1 in 7 Jobs in the Irish economy is accounted for by FDI. FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the Irish economy through its contribution to Exchequer finances, exports and research and development.</p><p>  Interaction with companies who have decided to invest in Ireland continuously highlights that there are many factors which attract such companies to this country. We have stable government, an attractive corporation tax rate, a young educated workforce, a technologically advanced environment and a strong track record in winning FDI.  In addition, Ireland is a member of the EU and the Euro zone.  Another factor which weighs heavily in our favour is the pro-business environment which permeates our economy. </p><p>  It is for these reasons that the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 ranks Ireland very favourably in a number of key areas of importance for FDI. The survey ranks Ireland:</p><p>  - First for availability of skilled labour</p><p>  - First for flexibility and adaptability of workforce</p><p>  -  First for investment incentives</p><p>  -  First for attitudes towards globalisation</p><p>  - Second for business legislation- openness to foreign investors</p><p>  - Second for large corporations that are efficient by international standards</p><p>  - Second for adaptability of companies</p><p>  - Fourth for Corporate Tax rate on profit and real corporate taxes</p><p>  I am mindful that, in order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for FDI projects, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014.  This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. </p></reply>

I am aware that many retail and commercial companies are concerned about the impact which upward only rent reviews are having on their cost base. When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28 February 2010. The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords. On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.</p><p>  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.  The Group will hold its first meeting in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Eligible occupations are largely determined in line with the regular analyses of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs with regard to the labour market&rsquo;s requirements in respect of strategically important skills.

The status of a prospective employee&rsquo;s inclusion in the &lsquo;Special Assignee Relief Programme&rsquo; is not a factor in assessing applications under the Employment Permits system.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.1127.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300067#WRN05400"><p>JobBridge is a National Internship Scheme that provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  The scheme provides work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors.  Interns receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. This is payable for the period of the internship. While the scheme has been availed of by client companies of the enterprise development agencies, it does not directly result in an increase in the employment associated with those companies (i.e. participants are interns receiving social welfare payments, and not full-time employees receiving a salary from the placement).</p><p>The Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey does not capture data in relation to the number of Job Bridge participants in client companies of the development agencies. Table 1 sets out the Enterprise Ireland cost per job over the period 2002-2011. The Cost per Job Sustained measure is calculated by Forf&aacute;s and takes into account all direct agency expenditure on all client companies in a seven year period. Only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of each seven year period are represented in the calculations. The number of JobBridge participants is not associated with these calculations, and therefore the scheme will not have any direct impact on the cost per job in the development agencies.  The 2012 figure will be calculated and reported as part of the Enterprise Ireland Annual Report and Accounts for 2012, due to be published in mid-2013.</p><p>Since 2007 the cost per job sustained has increased.  The reasons for this are largely threefold:</p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">1. Enterprise Ireland provided additional supports to ensure Irish-owned companies were in a position to withstand the worst recession in decades e.g. the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">2. Additional supports relating to Dairy, Beef and Sheep, and Food Competitiveness Funds were administered by EI on behalf of third party agencies and form part of the calculation.</div></p><p><div style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px">3. A lower number of jobs sustained compared to earlier seven year periods in the context of the severe economic recession and resulting job losses.</div></p><p><b>Table 1- EI Cost per Job Sustained 2002-2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Time Period</b></th><th><b>Cost per Job sustained (2011 prices)</b></th></tr><tr><td>1996-2002</td><td>&euro;11,761</td></tr><tr><td>1997-2003</td><td>&euro;10,342</td></tr><tr><td>1998-2004</td><td>&euro;8,984</td></tr><tr><td>1999-2005</td><td>&euro;5,962</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2006</td><td>&euro;4,385</td></tr><tr><td>2001-2007</td><td>&euro;6,556</td></tr><tr><td>2002-2008</td><td>&euro;7,988</td></tr><tr><td>2003-2009</td><td>&euro;12,124</td></tr><tr><td>2004-2010</td><td>&euro;12,560</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2011</td><td>&euro;12,024</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-04-23a.1131.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="00:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042300068#WRO00200"><p>At a sectoral level, the largest job losses over the 2008-2012 period were in the construction sector, where employment fell by over 160,000, in manufacturing (down by almost 50,000) and retail and wholesale distribution (down by over 40,000). Smaller falls were recorded across a range of other service industries. By contrast, at the end of 2012, employment in two sub-sectors - healthcare and the information/communications sector - were above the levels of 2007/2008.</p><p>  Driven primarily by these sectoral trends, the occupations most affected by the down turn were the skilled trades, where employment fell by about 140,000.  The sharp contraction in construction and manufacturing also partly explains the fall of 60,000 in the unskilled or &#8220;elementary&#8221; manual occupations, which contain a sizeable number of unskilled construction workers.  Smaller but nonetheless significant declines have occurred for clerical and secretarial jobs (down by 50,000) and for sales and transport occupations affected by the fall in distribution (down by 50,000).  By contrast, professional workers, associate &amp;amp; technical professionals and managers actually experienced slight increases over the course of the recession. The number of science/engineering professionals and technicians, for example, rose by 16,000 between 2008 and 2012.  </p><p>  When broken down by highest education level achieved, employment for those with at best a Leaving Certificate or Post Leaving Certificate qualification fell by almost 370,000 between 2007 and 2012 whereas employment for persons with a third-level qualification rose by over 100,000. These changes reflect the rapid growth in the numbers of people with higher qualifications in the overall population as well as changes in employment prospects for those with various qualifications. The employment <i>rate</i>  (percentage of the adult population with jobs) fell for all groups between 2007 and 2012; however, the rate for those with third-level fell by about 6 percentage points, from 85% to 79%, while that for those with Leaving Certificate or PLC qualifications fell by 15 percentage points, from 75% to 60%, and those with lower qualifications saw even greater reductions, of the order of 18 percentage points.</p><p>  As a result of the downturn, the unemployment rate has risen significantly for persons with lower levels of education. For persons with at most primary education, the unemployment rate increased from10.3% to 27.8% between 2008 and 2012. For persons with a best a lower secondary education unemployment rate increased from 10.6% to 25.5% and for persons with a best a Leaving Certificate the unemployment rate increased from 6.7% to 16.9%. By contrast, the unemployment rate for those with honours degrees was relatively lower, at 6.5%, in 2012.</p><p>  In recognition of the skills gap among the unemployed people, the Government operates a number of initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. These include the Back to Education Allowance (26,000 people), Springboard (6,000 people) and Momentum (6,500 places).  Eligible participants on both Springboard and Momentum programmes retain their welfare payments made through my Department.</p><p>  These special initiatives are in addition to the existing range of full-time vocational training options provided through F&Aacute;S that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. Specific Skills Training courses are employment-led and lead to qualifications that offer learners both generic and advanced skills. The expected outcomes are progression to employment in the occupational field or to further and higher education/training and the achievement of certification from levels 5 - 7 in the National Qualifications Framework.  F&Aacute;S also provides Traineeships which entail significant skill requirements best acquired through a combination of alternating periods of on and off-the-job training, as well as foundation courses for those who require them prior to going on to skills training.  There were some 21,000 participants on these three FAS programmes in 2012. F&Aacute;S has also expanded provision of free part-time and evening courses for unemployed people in recent years, and a further 21,000 people took such courses in 2012.   The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All relevant stakeholders will have an opportunity to input to the review.</p></reply>

The number of applications currently awaiting a decision  is just under 4,000.  The majority of these have already been processed and are awaiting additional information in order to make a decision. The information required to finalise these cases may be from the claimant themselves, a medical assessment opinion from one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors or a report from a social welfare inspector.  Once this outstanding information is received a decision will be made without delay.  In 2012 there was 15,493 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications registered. There were 18,483 claims processed in 2012, with 9,880 awarded, 6,828 disallowed, and 1,775 withdrawn.</p></reply>

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p><p>  The basic rules governing the maximum duration a person can remain on Community Employment (CE) are unchanged since 2006. The maximum participation limits for CE are 3 years in total for those under 55 years of age, and 6 years in total for those of 55 to 65 years of age. Off-shore islander clients are exempt from CE participation caps. Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-related social welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., 4 years for those under 55 and 7 years for those of 55 to 65. </p><p>  The actual length of time a person can remain on CE is dictated by a number of factors (as governed by the eligibility rules of CE):</p><p> - Age of the person</p><p> - Department of Social Protection (DSP ) payment and duration of receipt</p><p> - Previous participation on CE since 3<sup>rd</sup>   April 2000</p><p> - Whether they are considered job-ready at their CE contract end-date</p><p> - Engagement under a person's Individual Learner Plan (training &amp;amp; development)</p><p> - Budgetary limitations</p><p>  The overall duration limits are strictly enforced to maximize the number of places available for potential clients. </p><p>  There are two strands available on Community Employment (CE), namely Part-Time Integration Option (PTI), which is the one-year version of CE, and the Part-Time Job Option (PTJ), which is the three-year version of CE (subject to annually renewable contracts). All CE participant contracts are for 1 year's duration at a time. The ratio of PTI to PTJ places is set at 75% PTI to 25% PTJ to maintain the throughput of participants. A maximum of 10% of participants on the PTI Option can be extended into a subsequent year's participation. The annual renewal of PTJ participant contracts is subject to the factors mentioned above.</p><p>  Eligibility for the PTI Option is generally determined by being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum of 12 months. For the PTJ Option, the qualifying period is 3 years in receipt. There are some exceptions to these qualifying periods for certain categories of participants.  The only recent change to the CE operating Guidelines with respect to duration on the programme is that &#8220;time spent on CE no longer counts towards continued time on CE for new entrants who commence on or after 8 October 2012. Existing PTI participants can still have time spent on CE count as part of the qualifying period until they exit&#8221;.</p><p>  Previous to this amended rule being introduced, time spent on CE counted towards the CE-qualifying period, so it was possible for a client commencing CE under the PTI Option who had only been in receipt for 12 months to avail of one year's placement. If they happened to be in the 10% of PTIs extended into a second year, that would mean that the combination of their 12 months in receipt and two years on CE qualified them under the PTJ Option (i.e. 3 years on CE), thereby giving them a third consecutive year on CE.  The emphasis on shorter-term interventions on CE as part of the Pathways to Work Initiative is to assist the maximum number of eligible persons via participation on the scheme. The current rules governing CE eligibility allow for 10% persons engaged on a year's placement to have their time extended into a second year if they can demonstrate that they would benefit from such an extension.</p><p>  The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups which need access to CE - lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons.  DSP at all times is obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p></reply>

In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.</p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.

However, special arrangements do apply where a parent is working here and the children are resident in another EU Member State.  In 2012 the total cost of paying child benefit in respect of children resident in other EU countries was approximately &euro;13 million, down some 36% on 2008 when costs peaked.  This represents 0.65% of the total cost of child benefit expenditure.</p><p>  The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU regulations which co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  For the purposes of the EU regulations, Irish child benefit is classified as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under the EU regulations. As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty regarding free movement of persons.</p><p>  Before payment is made in respect of children resident in other EU countries it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will impact on any entitlement under the Irish system. Once payment has commenced, as part of the Department&rsquo;s on-going control programme, these customers are required to confirm periodically their continued entitlement to benefit.  Where questions arise in relation to entitlement, or there is a delay in responding to enquiries from the Department, payment is suspended pending investigation.</p><p>  Changes to EU legislation to modify child benefit entitlements in respect of non-resident children requires the agreement of the European Commission as any proposals for amendments must be tabled by it. I have raised the issue with the Commission and with relevant Ministers from other EU countries. The Commission stressed the importance attached to the system of coordinating social security for the role it plays in encouraging and facilitating free movement of people across the Union. It indicated extreme reluctance to introduce changes along the lines that have been discussed in this country because they would discriminate against migrant workers and would not be in line with judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.</p></reply>

In the case of a family size for the person concerned this rate is &euro;400.20.  All income in excess of this rate, in this case &euro;65.20, must go towards the family contribution towards the rent. In addition there is a minimum statutory contribution of, for a couple, &euro;35.00, giving a total family contribution of &euro;100.20.  This is what the family pay towards their rent; the balance is paid by way of rent supplement.  The rent on the property is &euro;900 per month which equates to &euro;207.70 per week. After the family contribution of &euro;100.20 this leaves a balance of &euro;107.50 per week to be paid by rent supplement. The monthly equivalent of this is &euro;465.80 which is what the person concerned is receiving.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that payments do not continue when a person is imprisoned data matching between the Irish Prison Service (IPS) and this Department is undertaken.  The Department began in 2005 by obtaining the prison data on a twice yearly basis.  Since July 2011, the data is obtained on a weekly basis and is matched against the Department's systems<b>,</b> in accordance with data matching regulations.</p><p>Since receiving prison data on a weekly basis, any social welfare claims in payment are stopped as soon as possible after the person is imprisoned.  In this manner, overpayments are minimised and the opportunity to continue to receive a payment while in prison is virtually eliminated.  If an overpayment has occurred, it is assessed for the period that the person was not entitled to the payment and the recovery of the overpayment is followed up by the Department.  The following tables provide details of the number of overpayments raised as a result of a person being in prison.  A breakdown of these cases between Irish or foreign prisons is not available.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of overpayments raised</th><th>Average amount of overpayment</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>324</td><td>&euro;4,500</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>614</td><td>&euro;3,400</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Not available</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><pcenter>2010 In Prison OPs by Scheme</pcenter><table><tr><th>Disability Allowance</th><th><div>        195 </div></th><th><div>&euro;1,215,749</div></th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td><div>          86 </div></td><td><div>&euro;124,566</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory</td><td><div>            3 </div></td><td><div>&euro;36,261</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td><div>          40 </div></td><td><div>&euro;92,671</div></td></tr></table><pcenter>2011 In Prison OPs by Scheme</pcenter><table><tr><th>Disability Allowance</th><th><div>        310 </div></th><th><div>&euro;1,443,385</div></th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td><div>        235 </div></td><td><div>&euro;289,410</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension</td><td><div>            8 </div></td><td><div>&euro;229,115</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is not in a position to publicly comment on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The increase in the number of overpayments raised due to imprisonment reflects the fact that the Department is now capturing this information from the IPS in a timely manner and acting on it by raising overpayments in all relevant cases.  The opportunity to commit this type of fraud has been virtually eliminated and the chances of being caught and required to repay any monies received has been substantially improved under the new system of weekly data matching with the IPS.</p></reply>

The Group engaged in a public consultation exercise which provided organisations and individuals with the opportunity to contribute their comments and proposals.  The Report of the Group, which recommended a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill.  In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.</p><p>  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 the Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in this Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill.</p><p>  There are a range of complex and sensitive issues involved in this proposed legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed. I feel that the committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I hope that my officials&rsquo; appearance before the committee can be scheduled before the summer. I believe this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas. When the Oireachtas committee has discussed the provisional draft heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation</p></reply>

All new invalidity pension claims are processed on receipt and a decision issues as soon as all relevant information is available.  At end of March 2013 there were 2,627 invalidity pension claims pending decision all of which have been actioned by a deciding officer.  Some 660 of these invalidity pension cases are EU/Bilateral cases which are awaiting information from another country or EU state and these take considerably longer than domestic cases to finalise.  In addition, claimants who following a negative decision on their claim, exercise their right of review and/or appeal can take significantly longer to process.  The processing time for individual claims can vary depending on the complexity of the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances and the information they provide in support.  In many cases, further information is required in order to make a decision, for example, a medical assessment, information from the claimant themselves or a report from a social welfare inspector on outstanding PRSI contributions or other issues.</p></reply>

That application has, however, been medically assessed at this point.  A recent analysis of the applications pending decision indicated that approximately 60% of them had been waiting for a decision for 12 weeks or fewer.  The general practice is that claims are decided in date of receipt order. However in some instances priority is given to certain claims, for example, claims received from 16 year olds whose parents/guardians had been in receipt of domiciliary care allowance or in cases where claimants are very ill.  The processing time for individual claims can vary depending on the complexity of the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances and the information they provide in support.

Once the level of FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks. On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings or other income.  When the 52 week period has expired, customers are invited to re-apply.  If at that stage they continue to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions their up-to-date family income is assessed for FIS purposes and a change in rate is approved if appropriate. </p><p>  In the case of the person concerned their last 52 week payment period for FIS expired on 13 March 2013. The income assessment for their renewal application was based on their family income as it stood in March 2013 and initially their application was refused as the weekly family income exceeded the prescribed income level for the family size.  However, it has subsequently transpired that their rate of One Parent Family Payment is being reduced from 25 April 2013. Accordingly their family income has been re-assessed and FIS has now been awarded at the weekly rate of &euro;20 for the 52 week period from 25 April 2013 to 23 April 2014.  The person concerned will be notified directly of this decision.</p></reply>

Following some small changes required by the Council's Jurist/Linguists, it is anticipated that the final text will be formally adopted by the Council this month.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Recommendation is that Member States should ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  With regard to </font>job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government's job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013,<font color="#2F2F2F"> a new recruitment incentive - JobsPlus - has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer's wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013. </font>  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment. This incentive will be launched for availability by July 2013.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The scale and nature of any additional measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. </font><font color="#2F2F2F">The size and the timescale for any additional provision, over and above that outlined above that is both desirable and feasible will be established over the coming months. </font></p></reply>

T&uacute;s has been able to harness the skills and talents of participants and apply these to the benefit of the local community while they continue to receive a payment based on the value of the prior jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  While the types of work that are undertaken are determined locally, the works that are undertaken must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the scheme, are undertaken by eligible organisations and that particular consideration is given to displacement of existing jobs.  It is a matter for the Board of each implementing body and the selection processes they operate to seek sufficient information and make enquiries to enable an assessment of displacement or deadweight to be determined. </p><p>  Since it commenced on 1st July, 2011, JobBridge has made good progress.

The standardisation of State pension age to 66 is one of the reform measures planned which aims to increase the sustainability of the Irish pension system and this was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011. The State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 1st January 2014 and thereafter, will increase to 67 in 2021and 68 in 2028.  People who are affected by the upcoming changes may be able to remain in work until age 66 while others may be able to avail of a social welfare payment where there is an income need.</p><p>  Existing legislation provides that, social welfare supports, such as job seekers benefits, will continue to be available to those who meet the qualifying conditions of the schemes available.  Furthermore, the legislation also provides that for those whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year, the payment will continue to be paid up until the age of 66 when State pension becomes payable for those who satisfy the qualifying conditions.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability </p></reply>

A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24. The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or T&uacute;s, a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.  </p><p>  I understand that the Deputy has been contacted with regard to these measures by Focus Ireland.  My officials are in contact with Focus Ireland in relation to their concerns. While the primary issue in this regard is a housing issue rather than one of income support, my Department will continue to engage with Focus Ireland.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In relation to a Youth Guarantee, under my chairmanship, the Council of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers (EPSCO) last month agreed a recommendation on an EU-wide Youth Guarantee.  The EPSCO Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The Recommendation will now move to be considered for formal adoption by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency - most likely in May.</font></p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p></reply>

Located at the last crossing point on the river Maine and taking its name from a castle demolished in the Cromwellian wars, Castlemaine has a very rich heritage.  There is no scheme that would provide funding on the basis of the 800th anniversary.  Official support is channelled towards specific activities, events or developments that might be proposed by the community and it can be sought from several agencies under various schemes each with specific eligibility requirements.

While much of the expenditure will have related to drilling rigs and seismic vessels, it also relates to expenditure on support and supply vessels and other services sourced at a local level, and the Corrib project has supported in the region of 1,000 direct jobs for several years.</p><p>  The principal future return to Ireland from successful exploration will be through tax paid on profits from petroleum production.  There will also be a secondary benefit in terms of economic activity generated by exploration and more particularly development and production projects.   The main factor that will influence the development of the industry is successful exploration.  The oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells drilled.  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much need exploration investment to Ireland.  </p></reply>

To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have, however, made enquiries in relation to this issue, which was mentioned in the course of the recent British Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Letterkenny on 4 March.  I am also aware that Minister of State, Ciaran Cannon, TD, addressed this matter in a Adjournment Debate on 7th   March last.</p><p>  I am advised that the UK Ministry of Defence undertook sea dumping of weapons and munitions as a means of disposing of redundant and surplus stocks and dealing with the legacy of weapons produced in the World Wars.  It is understood that the UK, which at the end of the war in 1945 had a surplus stock of 1.2 million tonnes, was not alone in this process and that most nations at the time disposed of such material by dumping at sea.  The relevant legal framework is the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972, now OSPAR, at which Ireland is usually represented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  In addition to OSPAR, Marine Notice No. 16 of 2001 issued by the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (now a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport) to all fishermen and other users of the sea relates to explosives and other explosive missiles sighted, picked up in trawls at sea or removed from wrecks. This notice covers chemical and conventional munitions and requires all encounters with such munitions to be reported to the Naval Authorities via the Irish Coast Guard Coast Radio Stations. Information on the location and type of munitions dumped in the Convention area was supplied by contracting parties and published by OSPAR in 2005.  The report identified more than 140 dump sites throughout the Convention area and this is believed to be the best information available.  In general terms, the distribution of known Conventional munitions dump sites tends to be in inshore waters whereas chemical weapons were dumped further offshore.</p><p>  I am aware that this issue has given rise to concerns and to be of further assistance to the Deputy, I will arrange for a copy of this question and reply to be forwarded to the Ministers of Environment, Community and Local Government and of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with a request that any additional information be forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections, and further information may be found at:http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-retail-market-reports-and-publications.aspx.</p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of great concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in disconnections in recent years has coincided with the economic recession, which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.</p><p>  In line with the CER&rsquo;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&rsquo;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In relation to gas the report states that for the period to end of September 2012, 63,933 Pay as You Go and token meters are installed, with 36,109 installed since December 2008.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Waterford, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  NBS services are available within 31 of the 130 Electoral Divisions in County Waterford.  The following table contains a list of these Electoral Divisions.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will shortly appoint experts, to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  It is expected that services will be available in areas such as Waterford after the procurement process is concluded and services are rolled out.  It is likely that, Waterford may also benefit from parts of commercial roll out of high speed services.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Waterford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Waterford</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>ED Name </b></th><th><b>ED Reference No.</b></th></tr><tr><td>BALLYDUFF </td><td>ED 227004</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYDURN </td><td>ED 227005</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYNAMULT </td><td>ED 227013</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYSAGGART MORE </td><td>ED 227014</td></tr><tr><td>BOHADOON </td><td>ED 227015</td></tr><tr><td>CARRIGCASTLE </td><td>ED 227019</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLERICHARD </td><td>ED 227021</td></tr><tr><td>CLASHMORE </td><td>ED 227022</td></tr><tr><td>COLLIGAN </td><td>ED 227025</td></tr><tr><td>COMERAGH </td><td>ED 227026</td></tr><tr><td>COUMARAGLIN </td><td>ED 227027</td></tr><tr><td>FEWS </td><td>ED 227038</td></tr><tr><td>FOX'S CASTLE </td><td>ED 227039</td></tr><tr><td>GARDENMORRIS </td><td>ED 227040</td></tr><tr><td>GEORGESTOWN </td><td>ED 227041</td></tr><tr><td>GLEN </td><td>ED 227042</td></tr><tr><td>GRAIGNAGOWER </td><td>ED 227045</td></tr><tr><td>GURTEEN </td><td>ED 227048</td></tr><tr><td>KILBARRYMEADEN </td><td>ED 227052</td></tr><tr><td>KILCOCKAN </td><td>ED 227053</td></tr><tr><td>KILWATERMOY EAST </td><td>ED 227062</td></tr><tr><td>KNOCKAUNBRANDAUN </td><td>ED 227065</td></tr><tr><td>KNOCKMAHON </td><td>ED 227066</td></tr><tr><td>MOCOLLOP </td><td>ED 227068</td></tr><tr><td>MODELLIGO </td><td>ED 227070</td></tr><tr><td>MOUNTKENNEDY </td><td>ED 227072</td></tr><tr><td>RATHGORMUCK </td><td>ED 227078</td></tr><tr><td>ROSS </td><td>ED 227082</td></tr><tr><td>SESKINAN </td><td>ED 227083</td></tr><tr><td>TEMPLEMICHAEL </td><td>ED 227087</td></tr><tr><td>TINNASAGGART </td><td>ED 227088</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The current position is that domestic water charges will not commence before 2014. The Government will be reviewing the timeline for charges with programme partners at the next review of the Programme of Assistance which commences this week.  My Department published the <i>Water Sector Reform Implementation Strategy</i> in October 2012. The implementation strategy sets out the high level milestones under the reform programme.  The strategy is available on my Department's website </p><p>  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water   company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.  The Government will assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  An appropriate approach to charging those customers who may not be metered when charges are introduced will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair. The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation that will take place as part of the regulatory process.</p></reply>

That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  Only developments , or parts of developments, that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.  Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  To date, over 900 cases have been submitted by lenders.  Of these, 370 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender. 25 Sales have now been completed.

The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out during the twelve-month period commencing in July 2013.  It is a function of the water services authorities (the 34 county and city councils) to implement the Inspection Plan in their functional areas.

However, two tenant purchase schemes by way of incremental purchase remain in operation, one for newly-built local authority houses and the other for existing local authority apartments.   It is a matter for the housing authority concerned to decide whether or not it is appropriate to accept an application for the above schemes. However, it is of critical importance that authorities apply sound lending criteria in deciding whether to advance house purchase loans in individual cases. My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that mortgage lending is prudentially based and that the capacity of a borrower fully to service a loan over the full term is realistically assessed and stress-tested.</p></reply>

The NSS serves as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions.  It also seeks to influence investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.

Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that a household with alternative accommodation that would meet its housing need is ineligible for social housing support. Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. This provision is reasonable in most cases.</p><p>  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. My Department is keeping the social housing assessment provisions under review and will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities by way of Regulations to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.</p></reply>

In 2012 , I introduced a once-off Litter Enforcement Grants Scheme, targeted specifically at the issue of fly tipping and small scale illegal dumping, encouraging local authorities to enhance their existing enforcement activities, through measures such as the purchase of CCTV equipment to allow for the effective monitoring of known litter black spots. I also launched, again in 2012, a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency&rsquo;s National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.   </p><p>  Existing penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. </p><p>  Following a review of legislation in this area and notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of a specific on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping. I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.   </p><p>  Enforcement action in relation to illegal dumping is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), which supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities. My Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers and the OEE. Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing its planned enforcement action in relation to activities such as illegal dumping, towards which this funding will be utilised. </p><p>  In relation to the issue of &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo;, the Data Protection Commissioner has previously indicated to my Department that actions taken by local authorities in publishing the names and addresses of persons fined or convicted as a result of littering or illegal dumping, whether by publication on their websites or by notices published in the local press and paid for by the local authority, would be in breach of the principles of data protection.  These principles are contained in the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, and in particular, by Section 2A of that Act. Having examined this matter in some detail, I do not plan to introduce legislation allowing for &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo; at this time.</p></reply>

The production of the revised noise maps is the first step in the review of the noise action plan for the Dublin Agglomeration, which is to be completed by July 2013. The draft Noise Action Plan will be made available for public consultation on the websites of the Dublin-based local authorities, with notices being placed in newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties for consideration before the Plan is finalised. </p><p>  My Department does not provide funding for implementing measures proposed in noise action plans, which is a matter for the relevant noise mapping body. Complaints about local traffic-related noise should be addressed to the relevant roads authority in the first instance.

The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. </p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate. It is open to persons, including members of the Architect's Alliance of Ireland, the Group of Independent Architects of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design and surveying of buildings to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors as established under Part 3 and Part 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007.

In particular, it is worth recalling that the lead role in combating fuel laundering rests with the Revenue Customs Service who work closely with all the relevant law enforcement agencies within the State and from Northern Ireland in tackling this activity. </p><p>  With regard to those responsibilities that fall within the remit of my Department, and particularly in the context of cross border cooperation in the investigation of organised crime, I can inform the Deputy that the issue of fuel laundering does, of course, feature in discussions at the various fora established for the purpose of promoting such cooperation.  As highlighted in the Cross Border Threat Assessment for 2012, fuel laundering continues to be a serious concern for authorities, North and South. Recognising this shared concern a Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group Task Force, comprising representatives from PSNI, HM Revenue Customs, SOCA (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau has been established to target these activities on an all island basis. </p><p>  The annual Cross Border Seminar on Organised Crime, which is an important event in the law enforcement calendar for agencies on both sides of the border, provides an opportunity to assess and address the ever changing trends in crime and the related Cross Border Threat Assessment.  This seminar is organised jointly each year between the Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my Department.  Such cross border co-operation is further reflected in the joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  </p><p>  At political level, I meet and maintain contact very regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation.  Officials from our Departments also meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments in these matters.  In concluding, I can assure the Deputy that there continues to be comprehensive and positive North-South co-operation in combating all forms of cross border crime.</p></reply>

The sentences that can never become spent under the Bill are:  (1) a sentence of imprisonment of more than 12 months (except in the case of a sentence of up to 24 months which is fully suspended and the suspension is not subsequently revoked in whole or in part); (2) a sentence imposed for an offence that is reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court; and (3) a sentence imposed for a sexual offence.</p><p>  A maximum of 2 convictions may become spent under the Bill.  However, where a person is convicted of more than one offence at a single court sitting, the convictions may be treated as one conviction for the purpose of this limit.  There are a number of situations where the provisions of the Bill do not apply and a person will still have to disclose all convictions.  These include where the person wishes to work with children or vulnerable persons, work in certain positions in the civil and public service, or apply for certain licences.</p></reply>

The initial commitment was to publish the Bill in Quarter 1 of 2012. However, given the complexities involved in drafting comprehensive reform legislation of this nature, the deadline was ultimately extended to the end of June 2012.  The commitment to the Troika was met by the publication of the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 on 29 June, 2012.</p><p>  The  Troika team was in Dublin in January 2013 as part of their normal quarterly review of the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland and met with officials from my Department as part of that review process.  The Troika team noted the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which represented significant progress since their last visit. The measures being taken by my Department, the Insolvency Service and other relevant parties to bring about the full operation of the new debt resolution processes were discussed.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012, was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December, 2012 and signed into law by the President on 26 December, 2012.</p><p>  Part 6 of the Act was commenced on 18 January 2013.  The provisions of Part 1 (other than section 6), Part 2 (other than section 13), sections 25 and 47, sections 126 to 141, Part 5 and Schedules 2 and 3 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 came into operation on 1 March 2013<font color="#0000FF">. </font>  The Insolvency Service was established on 1 March 2013 by Ministerial Order made on 20 February last.</p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) Public Information Campaign was formally launched on 18 April, 2013.  Since the Director of the Service took up his position at the end of last October, he has overseen a great deal of work within a short period of time.  This included setting up an implementation team to address all of the operational matters necessary for the new Service; arranging office accommodation; recruiting and training specialist staff; and designing and implementing the new regulatory and IT frameworks required to accept applications. The dedicated ISI website and information line went live on 18 April. Trained ISI staff have begun taking calls from the public and will be able to advise people in regard to which debt resolution process may be most appropriate to their situation from the three new processes available.</p><p>  The Act will be fully commenced as soon as all of the remaining necessary preparations for administration of its provisions are finalised which is expected by the end of June 2013.</p></reply>

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to approximately 4,800 persons.  It is worth noting the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation in the RIA system in recent years.  During the four year period ending on 31 December, 2012, RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons. During this period, RIA spending had declined from &euro;91.5 million to &euro;62.3 million i.e.32%.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens. </p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, I acknowledge that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

The Bill also makes provision, as part of these undertakings, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. These are key reforms that should reduce the number<b></b>of court proceedings that arise under the current, multi-layered regulatory framework and, by the same token, reduce the waiting time for a final decision.  These are among the many aspects of the Bill that are under ongoing consideration at my Department, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General, and will modernise and streamline the current immigration regime. </p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts. It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year. </p><p>  In addition, and with a view to streamlining the management and processing by the Courts of applications for judicial review in the asylum and immigration areas, I propose to bring forward proposals to amend the statutory provisions relating to judicial review which are set out in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.</p></reply>

They are each remanded on continuing bail with a trial date having been set for January 2014.</p><p>  Separately, in December 2012 one of the persons referred to was arrested and charged by Garda Officers from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with further breaches of the Companies Act, 1990 and is currently before the Courts in this regard.  The investigation into these matters is ongoing and a number of files submitted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Director of Corporate Enforcement remain with the Director of Public Prosecutions awaiting her direction.</p><p>  I share the widespread concern that clarity be brought to these crucial matters as soon as possible, however, what is important now is that nothing be said which would in any way risk the possibility of prejudicing any criminal proceedings.</p></reply>

The essential role of JPCs is to provide appropriate advice to the Garda&iacute; and local authorities and to support collaborative engagement among stakeholders in relation to local policing issues.</p><p>  In relation to the costs associated with JPCs, it is important to note that the Committees are intended as a forum to improve collaboration and engagement between relevant agencies and stakeholders and are not intended to undertake new administrative functions with corresponding budgets and other resources.  There are already substantial resources deployed to addressing local policing and community safety issues and the JPCs are intended to enhance how these resources are deployed,  not supplement them. Therefore each agency involved in the Committees is generally expected to meet the expenses arising for itself in establishing and operating the JPCs from within its existing resources.</p><p>  The current operating guidelines for JPCs were issued in 2008 and these envisage that quarterly meetings of JPCs would be the norm.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has appointed appropriate officers to each of the Joint Policing Committees in accordance with the guidelines. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are essential participants in the JPC process and attend meetings at the times and dates specified by the respective local authority.  I am further informed that it is not possible to provide details of the attendance of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the meetings of the 114 JPCs as a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources would be required to compile this information. In this regard it should be noted that further information concerning each JPC is available from the relevant local authority.</p><p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  In the spirit of that commitment I initiated a review of the operation of JPCs and, on 29 November 2012, I published a discussion document to open the matter for wider consultation.  My Department, together with the Garda authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is examining the feedback received during the consultation process, to see if any amendments should be made to the existing guidelines which would enhance the operation of JPCs. The Deputy will also appreciate that the review process will need to take into account the broader developments with respect to local government reform which are underway and the implications of this reform for the operation of JPCs.</p></reply>

While the general principle is that justice be administered in public, the underlying concern is that family law proceedings relate to matters which are sensitive and private to the parties and there is no public interest in requiring that their identities be published.</p><p>  The application of the <i>in camera </i>  rule in relation to court hearing of family law and child care proceedings has given rise to a public perception that undue secrecy is attached to the administration of these areas of the law and that there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which they are administered.</p><p>  The proposal in the Bill is to retain the privacy provisions in respect of such court proceedings while allowing the attendance of <i>bona fide </i>  representatives of the press.  The courts will, however, retain the power to exclude representatives of the Press or restrict or prohibit the publication of evidence given in the proceedings in certain circumstances.  In addition, a strict prohibition will apply on reporting of material likely to identify the parties to the proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  The Bill aims to provide for a careful balancing of the need for privacy for persons involved in family law and child care proceedings with the need to ensure access to important information on the operation of family and child care law in our courts.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I hope to progress the Bill before the Oireachtas with a view to its enactment before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions. All potential applicants, in addition to their existing professional qualifications, will have to demonstrate evidence of the applicants' satisfactory knowledge of the provisions of the Act and the law generally as it applies in the State relating to the insolvency of individuals and in particular statutory provisions relating to such persons.</p></reply>

The position with regard to my Department is unchanged since then and was stated as follows.</p><p>  <i>There are no current plans to engage in any form of blanket regularisation of migrants who are unlawfully in the State. It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality. Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.</i></p><p><i>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances. At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed the Department continues to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis. However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.</i></p><p><i>  At EU level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &#8220;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&#8221;. While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases. In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</i></p><p><i>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State such as the welfare, health, housing and education areas, along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.</i></p><p><i>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant. However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home. That decision should be respected.</i></p></reply>

Work is well advanced on this and it will include guidelines on all of the main issues including eligibility, dependency, the financial resources necessary to sponsor a dependant and any personal requirements the person seeking entry must meet. The purpose is to update the existing policies in operation and to address any gaps in the current regime in the interests of applicants, practitioners and staff.</p><p>  Ireland already provides significant possibilities for family reunification and substantial numbers of cases are processed annually.  It should also be noted that our existing policies in respect of certain classes of migration, for high skilled workers, researchers, PhD students, entrepreneurs and investors, providing for immediate family reunification of spouse and dependent children, would compare very favourably with many other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

In this context, unfortunately, the situation that we now face is that there is currently no new agreement on public pay issues but there is still a projected &euro;300 million budgetary shortfall in 2013.

The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Adults) Act 2012 gives legal effect to this vetting requirement.</p><p>  The Minister is in consultation with his colleagues to determine the appropriate date for commencement of the 2012 National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. </p></reply>

The service was established by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service for certain types of patient, particularly in light of the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.  A review of the pilot service is currently underway and is being carried out by an Audit and Evaluation Group established under the agreement.  A Report, with recommendations, will be submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health, before the end of the pilot period.</p><p>  The review will examine the operational data, including costs and clinical outcomes.  All relevant data concerning the missions undertaken is currently being compiled and, while full details are not yet available, I can confirm that EAS missions have been concentrated on the west of Ireland as this area was the geographical focus of the pilot service. </p></reply>

Benefits under the schemes are additional to Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension that may be payable under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of deceased personnel by virtue of their social insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Provision for the payment of pensions by my Department to the spouses and children of deceased Enlisted Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force was first made in 1978 when a Contributory Pension Scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Personnel serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  In 1985, Enlisted Personnel were given a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants when all those who had opted out of the original scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  The deceased spouse of the person in question therefore had two opportunities to join the scheme, but he opted not to do so.  In the circumstances, I regret that the person in question is not eligible for a pension from my Department.  However, she should contact the Department of Social Protection, as she may be entitled to a pension or other benefits from that Department.</p></reply>

The provision of compensation has to be placed in the context of the economic benefits accruing to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease and, particularly, the short payback time involved for individual farmers as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  The strategy of my Department is to concentrate its scarce resources in continuing to support Animal Health Ireland in its ongoing work to enhance the value for beef and dairy farmers through superior animal health and in establishing control programmes for non-regulated diseases of livestock in Ireland.</p></reply>

By way of update on the matter, further to the Government's decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests be considered for sale, NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have worked to examine the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte's forest assets.  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.  I note that these are also the issues raised by the Donegal Woodland Owners Society Limited.</p><p>  The Government is fully conscious of such concerns in relation to the Coillte sale proposal.  A number of these issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il debate on the proposal on 26 and 27 February last.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.  I wish to reiterate that it is the sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests that is under consideration and not the sale of the land or the company.</p></reply>

The presence of equine DNA discovered in a single burger here ultimately uncovered a pan European problem.  I arranged, in my role as President of the Agriculture Council, to have the matter discussed at EU level and the Commission promptly proposed the EU testing programme, the results of which were published on 16 April.</p><p>  The results show that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive.  In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative.  In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive.  Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of  2,185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.</p><p>  Consideration is being given at EU level to the outcome of these tests to determine what further action is required.  In the meantime, DNA testing is being carried out under national protocol by food business operators in Ireland and the results are being published by the FSAI. </p></reply>

The EU Food Hygiene regulations which are the principal basis of our food safety system do not cover food quality issues and do not mention food spoilage or this organism.  Accordingly this is not a focus of official controls in approved meat plants and in the circumstances responsibility for dealing with the matter rests with industry.</p><p>  In October 2009 Teagasc published a report on the Control of Blown Package Spoilage in Vacuum Packaged Meat.  This report concluded that: &quot;Blown pack spoilage (BPS) represents a significant commercial loss to Irish meat processors.  This research discovered that the organisms causing BPS are ubiquitous in the abattoir environment, making eradication very difficult.  The risk of BPS is best managed through a process of regular treatment of plant and equipment with a sporicidal agent such as peroxyacetic acid, good hygiene to minimise carcass contamination and removal of the heat shrinkage stage during vacuum packaging as this activates the spores and reduces the time to spoilage.&quot;</p><p>  The report provides guidance to industry on minimising the risk of this problem.  The research, which was funded by my Department and carried out by Teagasc, discovered a new Blown Pack Spoilage Clostridia species (<i>C. ruminantium</i>); delivered key data and demonstrated the detrimental effect of vacuum packaging heat shrinkage in spore activation.  As a result of this work,<i></i>Teagasc's food research centre in Ashtown, Co. Dublin developed a PCR assay to detect the problem and is now offering a testing service to the meat industry and other food industries.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is about to fund a new research project which will include an investigation of issues associated with <i>C. estertheticum </i>and to develop and validate a rapid real time PCR assay capable of detecting and enumerating <i>C. estertheticum,</i><i>C. gasigenes</i> and <i>C. ruminantium</i> .</p></reply>

The scheme was initially Exchequer funded under a pilot scheme from 2007-2009 and has been co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme since 2010.  My Department has no role in relation to commercial arrangements between individual farmers and contractors for the end use of their energy crops.  The pricing of product is also a commercial matter.</p><p>  In February 2012, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, T.D., introduced REFIT supports for bioenergy, including tariffs to support Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion.  These tariffs are designed to provide financial incentives for the end use of energy crops, including miscanthus.  In December 2011, I amended the terms and conditions of the Bioenergy Scheme so as to remove the obligation on growers to maintain the crop for seven years as a condition of retaining grant-aid.

The initiative is expected to receive funding of &euro;14 million to provide, in a full year, in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents to take up employment.  </p><p>  Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of these opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment.  Preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme. Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner. </p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot phase of the programme will be evaluated to establish if the programme meets this objective and, if necessary, to identify areas where corrective action is required.</p></reply>

Childcare services participating in the ECCE programme are paid a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate, the pre-school leader must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full Level 7 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and meet other conditions as set out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  A joint  inspection pilot conducted by the HSE  Inspectorate and the Department of Education and Skills was recently completed.

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.</p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.</p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of December 2012:</p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.</p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.</p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.</p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.</p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.</p></reply>

In the interim, consideration needed to be given to the criteria for eligibility, possible models of assessment and the budgetary and funding implications.  In February 2012, an online pre-application questionnaire was carried out to determine the number of potential applicants who may be eligible.  173 applicants responded, 135 approx. of whom are likely to meet the criteria and also meet the requirements in order to engage in the assessment process.  A programme director was formally appointed for this project in May 2012 and work is underway to set up the structures and processes required to implement the alternative route.  The various assessment components are being prepared for pilot at present.  The College will open the process for the taking of applications from 23 April 23, 2013.</p><p>  The eligibility criteria for application for this route to membership have been agreed by the ICGP Postgraduate Training Committee and this was endorsed by the Council of the College in March 2011.

Of its nature, selection criteria may exclude some applicants.  It is impossible to comment on an individual doctor's eligibility for participation in the Alternative Route Programme until they formally apply and supply the necessary details to the programme team for assessment.

This event provides a forum for wider public consultation and discussion on social inclusion issues, in particular for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the groups that work with them.  The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.  In relation to disability funding, this Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2013, and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012,  by providing the following specialist disability services:	residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.  The Government and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.  Currently the National Disability Unit is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services in terms of a cohesive and collaborative approach to meeting the needs of school leavers within the resources available.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of this funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible.</p></reply>

The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  In 2011, I established a Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council Recommendation on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Since that time work has been progressing steadily on the development of the Plan.  This has included a Consultation Event with stakeholders in Farmleigh last June followed by an on-line consultation.  Work on the drafting of the plan is well underway and it is my intention to publish the Plan by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I do accept that there is a need for the use of sunbeds to be restricted, especially for children, because of the increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.  The Government has approved the drafting of legislation in this regard.  This legislation will prohibit the use of sunbeds on a sunbed premises by persons under 18 years of age and will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include: (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises; (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age; (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises; (iv) an exemption for medical purposes; (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE; (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users; (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises; (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices; (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the drafting of this legislation.  It is important to bear in mind that the Bill, when finalised, must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive <i>prior</i> to the publication and introduction of the Bill in the Oireachtas.  This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm.  Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The fluoride currently used is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2).  It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.</p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

The HSE also recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy. Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery. The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people and to facilitate the development of the home help service.</p><p>  While the HSE announced a reduction in the provision of home help hours as one of a number of measures required to address the significant 2012 budget deficit last October, this was subject to home help services continuing to be available to those assessed as requiring them. The HSE&rsquo;s 2013 Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.</p><p>  The number of hours worked by home help assistants varies according to service needs. Their terms and conditions were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home help assistants.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. The parties have since met on a number of occasions in relation to contractual issues under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and this engagement is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>  -	costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>  -	price(s) previously charged,</p><p>  -	local market price, and</p><p>  -	Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  An NTPF pricing agreement is in place with the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.  It is scheduled for renewal on 1 July 2013 and NTPF are currently in contact with the proprietors concerning that renewal.</p></reply>

The HSE National Service Plan 2013 commits to a number of objectives including the further development of suicide prevention initiatives and forensic services; community mental health teams for adults, children and older persons and for mental health intellectual disability; and to the recruitment of 477 additional staff to implement these measures.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, the HSE, in consultation with the Department of Health, is working towards finalising the allocation of these resources.  Business cases from each HSE Region are being finalised and examined, against each of the identified objectives, detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future with a view to recruitment of the additional staff proceeding as soon as possible. 384 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention recognises the youth sector as a high risk group and sets out a number of specific actions.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   </p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  This includes an additional &euro;1 million from the &euro;35 million allocation for 2013 (above).  The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the  most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention which runs until 2014.  I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.</p><p>  This reviewed approach will build on progress made to date, which includes the provision of awareness and training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), National Mental Health Awareness Campaigns as well as the Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp;amp; Suicide Prevention which were jointly developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011, charges apply for in-patient services other than for acute hospital care and for long-term residential care services supported under the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Fair Deal), both of which are subject to separate charging regimes. Under these Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period. <b></b>Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility. </p><p>  I understand that directions to ensure the uniform application of the existing legislation on charges for in-patient respite care services across all HSE areas were circulated by the HSE at the end of March 2013 for implementation with immediate effect. This development brought areas that were not charging for in-patient respite care services into line with other areas that were already charging for such services. As a result, and in the interests of fairness and equity, in-patient respite care charges have now been implemented in all areas on a standard and consistent basis in  accordance with the legislation in place since 2005.</p><p>  The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The Regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.  The charging legislation provides that the HSE may reduce or waive charges where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to individual financial circumstances (including whether there are dependants).</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The current Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA. The standards have been submitted to my Department for approval and I expect that they will be formally approved shortly with a likely publication and launch of the standards next month.    </p><p>  Work is also underway in the Department on both the &lsquo;Registration and Inspection&rsquo; regulations and the &lsquo;Care and Welfare&rsquo; regulations required to bring the standards into law.

This timescale, however, is subject to final agreement on the staffing and resources required in addition to the necessity to recruit and train the inspectorate staff in time for the commencement of the regulatory regime.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the required staff are in place to commence registration and inspection of this sector later this year.  </p><p>  It is also important to point out that while the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with these standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector. </p></reply>

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.</p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:</p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;</p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;</p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;</p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.</p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Last December, the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i>   case.  Intensive work is underway in my Department on drafting this legislation and it is the Government's intention that the Heads of a Bill will be published in April.</p></reply>

Beechpark is a regional HSE service which provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The service has to operate within the financial and other parameters applying.</p><p>  Importantly, the Beechpark service is working with local implementation groups to progress disability services for children and young people across the HSE's Dublin north-east and Dublin-mid-Leinster areas.  They are focussing on the current service model and service delivery structure provided by all service providers in the area, with a view to addressing the realignment of resources in the context of the report of the national reference group, the national review of autism services report and the progressing disability services programme.  This issue is also being examined by the independent Dublin Beechpark service review group.</p><p>  While the current economic position presents challenges in how best to maximise the provision of services with available resources, I am committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest extent possible.  In that context, I have raised my concerns with the HSE regarding staff rotation and the impact of the public sector recruitment moratorium on front-line staff, especially therapists.  I will also continue to work closely with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to address this matter. </p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time  data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment. </p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the Special Delivery Unit will  also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  In relation to this particular query raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Health Service Executive to investigate the situation and respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there are mental health risks - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i> case.  The aim of the Bill is to bring clarity and certainty in relation to the process for the determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible on the basis that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of that pregnancy.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: <i>.</i>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes. </p></reply>

While my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups in coming together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice in so far as is possible.  There are a number of issues still to be clarified, however.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.</p><p>  Officials of my Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available. They will work through the outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed with a view to achieving regulation of the profession as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.  I would like to emphasise that while counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are of course subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Kerry area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  </p></reply>

The increased funding for the RTP has led to increases in the level of services provided rising from 40,000 services in 2003 to 217,686 services in 2012.  The number of passenger journeys recorded on those services also increased from 151,000 in 2003 to 1.73 million in 2012.</p><p>  Since 1<sup>st</sup> April 2012 the National Authority (NTA has been managing the Programme with Pobal administering it on the NTA's behalf.</p><p><b>  Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP</b></p><p>- The RTP was selected for a Value for Money and Policy Review in line with a commitment given at the launch of the Programme in 2007.  The Review covered the period 2002 to 2009.</p><p>- Key findings of the Review include:</p><p>- Concerns over the value for money in the context of a rate of increase in Programme funding without an accompanying equivalent increase in passenger numbers or services </p><p>- The current organisational structure for delivery (35 RTP groups) is a key factor in the lack of cost efficiencies being achieved both in administration and operations</p><p>- The cost of administration has been and remains very high as a proportion of total RTP group expenditure (22% in 2009)</p><p>- Substantial increases in operating costs - between 2007 and 2009 wages and salaries doubled as a consequence of increased staffing and salary levels</p><p>- Lack of data to measure the benefits of the Programme in terms of addressing social inclusion objectives and data gaps in the framework of performance monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>  The Review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme.  The NTA was tasked with implementing the findings of the Review.</p><p>  The main recommendations of the report are:</p><p>  - Reduce overall Programme costs particularly the administration costs</p><p>  - Improve efficiency of the Programm</p><p>  - Address the status of the Programme within the context of public transport regulation in Ireland</p><p>  - Develop a detailed appraisal plan for an organisational restructuring to achieve greater programme efficiencies</p><p>  - Better alignment to be established between the voluntary county-based RTP groups involved and the Local Authorities</p><p>  Administration costs to the Programme were reduced by 33.5 % by end 2012.  Combined with the reduction in Pobal's costs, the threshold administration proportion of 17% recommended in the VfM Review was also achieved by end 2012.  In order to achieve the recommended administration costs of 13%, the proposed restructuring of the RTP is required.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  The RTP budget for 2014 - 2015 will be determined as part of the estimates and budgetary process for these years.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Donegal area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>

Benefits under the schemes are additional to Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension that may be payable under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of deceased personnel by virtue of their social insurance (PRSI) contributions.  Provision for the payment of pensions by my Department to the spouses and children of deceased Enlisted Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force was first made in 1978 when a Contributory Pension Scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Personnel serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  In 1985, Enlisted Personnel were given a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants when all those who had opted out of the original scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  The deceased spouse of the person in question therefore had two opportunities to join the scheme, but he opted not to do so.  In the circumstances, I regret that the person in question is not eligible for a pension from my Department.  However, she should contact the Department of Social Protection, as she may be entitled to a pension or other benefits from that Department.</p></reply>

By way of update on the matter, further to the Government's decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests be considered for sale, NewERA, Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have worked to examine the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte's forest assets.  Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.  I note that these are also the issues raised by the Donegal Woodland Owners Society Limited.</p><p>  The Government is fully conscious of such concerns in relation to the Coillte sale proposal.  A number of these issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il debate on the proposal on 26 and 27 February last.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.  I wish to reiterate that it is the sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests that is under consideration and not the sale of the land or the company.</p></reply>

I have also been speaking to banks, co-ops and grain and feed merchants to highlight the challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather, and insisting they take a flexible approach to dealing with short term credit issues.

Difficult conditions experienced on farms last summer have been compounded by an extended winter. </p><p>  I am receiving daily updates from Teagasc on the situation and I have asked that for this crucial period, top priority is given to supporting farmers in need of assistance.  I have also been speaking to banks, co-ops and grain and feed merchants to highlight the challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather, and insisting they take a flexible approach to dealing with short term credit issues. Contact is being maintained with the co-operatives and some have commenced sourcing fodder supplies in the United Kingdom. I will be meeting with representative from banks and co-operatives tomorrow.</p><p>  In relation to the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, I would urge farmers to also contact their local agricultural advisor.  Where winter fodder is limited, advisors can provide specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this Spring.  I am keeping this matter under constant review.</p></reply>

The presence of equine DNA discovered in a single burger here ultimately uncovered a pan European problem.  I arranged, in my role as President of the Agriculture Council, to have the matter discussed at EU level and the Commission promptly proposed the EU testing programme, the results of which were published on 16 April.</p><p>  The results show that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive.  In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative.  In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive.  Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of  2,185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.</p><p>  Consideration is being given at EU level to the outcome of these tests to determine what further action is required.  In the meantime, DNA testing is being carried out under national protocol by food business operators in Ireland and the results are being published by the FSAI. </p></reply>

The EU Food Hygiene regulations which are the principal basis of our food safety system do not cover food quality issues and do not mention food spoilage or this organism.  Accordingly this is not a focus of official controls in approved meat plants and in the circumstances responsibility for dealing with the matter rests with industry.</p><p>  In October 2009 Teagasc published a report on the Control of Blown Package Spoilage in Vacuum Packaged Meat.  This report concluded that: &quot;Blown pack spoilage (BPS) represents a significant commercial loss to Irish meat processors.  This research discovered that the organisms causing BPS are ubiquitous in the abattoir environment, making eradication very difficult.  The risk of BPS is best managed through a process of regular treatment of plant and equipment with a sporicidal agent such as peroxyacetic acid, good hygiene to minimise carcass contamination and removal of the heat shrinkage stage during vacuum packaging as this activates the spores and reduces the time to spoilage.&quot;</p><p>  The report provides guidance to industry on minimising the risk of this problem.  The research, which was funded by my Department and carried out by Teagasc, discovered a new Blown Pack Spoilage Clostridia species (<i>C. ruminantium</i>); delivered key data and demonstrated the detrimental effect of vacuum packaging heat shrinkage in spore activation.  As a result of this work,<i></i>Teagasc's food research centre in Ashtown, Co. Dublin developed a PCR assay to detect the problem and is now offering a testing service to the meat industry and other food industries.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is about to fund a new research project which will include an investigation of issues associated with <i>C. estertheticum </i>and to develop and validate a rapid real time PCR assay capable of detecting and enumerating <i>C. estertheticum,</i><i>C. gasigenes</i> and <i>C. ruminantium</i> .</p></reply>

The scheme was initially Exchequer funded under a pilot scheme from 2007-2009 and has been co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme since 2010.  My Department has no role in relation to commercial arrangements between individual farmers and contractors for the end use of their energy crops.  The pricing of product is also a commercial matter.</p><p>  In February 2012, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, T.D., introduced REFIT supports for bioenergy, including tariffs to support Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion.  These tariffs are designed to provide financial incentives for the end use of energy crops, including miscanthus.  In December 2011, I amended the terms and conditions of the Bioenergy Scheme so as to remove the obligation on growers to maintain the crop for seven years as a condition of retaining grant-aid.  This afforded an opportunity for growers who wished to exit the scheme to do so without penalty and was available to all growers including those who had established crops since the commencement of the scheme in 2007.</p></reply>

Section 20 of the Act empowers, but does not oblige, the Minister to make Ministerial Orders for specified purposes and the nature of offences that may be prosecuted. The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1989 was made under powers conferred by several sections, including a number of those provided for in Section 20, of the Act. The Order provides for, inter alia, the prohibition of tuberculosis testing without Department permission, the type of test to be used, the tagging of reactors, the removal, movement, control and slaughter of reactors. Similarly the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order, 1991 as amended was made under powers conferred by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, including section 20, and contains similar provisions to the TB Order.  Statistics on the numbers of TB reactors removed up to the end of 2012 were provided in the February reply. The number of reactors removed to date in 2013 (21 April) is 3,240.

The initiative is expected to receive funding of &euro;14 million to provide, in a full year, in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents to take up employment.  </p><p>  Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of these opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment.  Preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme. Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner. </p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot phase of the programme will be evaluated to establish if the programme meets this objective and, if necessary, to identify areas where corrective action is required.</p></reply>

Childcare services participating in the ECCE programme are paid a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate, the pre-school leader must hold a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full Level 7 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and meet other conditions as set out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  A joint  inspection pilot conducted by the HSE  Inspectorate and the Department of Education and Skills was recently completed.

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.</p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.</p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of December 2012:</p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.</p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.</p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.</p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.</p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.</p></reply>

A review of the pilot is being carried out by the EAS Audit and Evaluation Group, comprising representatives from the NAS, including its Medical Director, the Air Corps and the Departments of Health and Defence, as required by the Memorandum of Understanding between the departments which established the pilot.  The review is focussed on data in relation to operational issues and clinical outcomes arising from the pilot, with a view to agreeing recommendations, in the event that a decision is made to provide this type of service, on how best to proceed.

Any alternative route to membership of the College must be approved by the ICGP and must be of equivalent standard to the conventional route to membership, i.e. formal training undertaken in an accredited GP training programme and completion of end point assessment - the MICGP examination.</p><p>  In March 2009, the College sought a declaration of interest in order to gauge the level of interest in the alternative route to membership.  In the interim, consideration needed to be given to the criteria for eligibility, possible models of assessment and the budgetary and funding implications.  In February 2012, an online pre-application questionnaire was carried out to determine the number of potential applicants who may be eligible.  173 applicants responded, 135 approx. of whom are likely to meet the criteria and also meet the requirements in order to engage in the assessment process.  A programme director was formally appointed for this project in May 2012 and work is underway to set up the structures and processes required to implement the alternative route.  The various assessment components are being prepared for pilot at present.  The College will open the process for the taking of applications from 23 April 23, 2013.</p><p>  The eligibility criteria for application for this route to membership have been agreed by the ICGP Postgraduate Training Committee and this was endorsed by the Council of the College in March 2011.  It details the minimum requirements with regard to GP experience and training and attainment of this experience and training within defined dates.  Of its nature, selection criteria may exclude some applicants.  It is impossible to comment on an individual doctor's eligibility for participation in the Alternative Route Programme until they formally apply and supply the necessary details to the programme team for assessment. All information will be updated on the ICGP website after 23 April 23 on the following link: </p></reply>

This event provides a forum for wider public consultation and discussion on social inclusion issues, in particular for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the groups that work with them.  The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.  In relation to disability funding, this Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2013, and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012,  by providing the following specialist disability services:	residential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.  The Government and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant/Home Support Hours.</p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.  Currently the National Disability Unit is liaising with the Regional Leads for Disability Services in terms of a cohesive and collaborative approach to meeting the needs of school leavers within the resources available.  Both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of this funding in a creative and flexible manner so as to secure as many places as possible.</p></reply>

The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  In 2011, I established a Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council Recommendation on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Since that time work has been progressing steadily on the development of the Plan.  This has included a Consultation Event with stakeholders in Farmleigh last June followed by an on-line consultation.  Work on the drafting of the plan is well underway and it is my intention to publish the Plan by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I do accept that there is a need for the use of sunbeds to be restricted, especially for children, because of the increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.  The Government has approved the drafting of legislation in this regard.  This legislation will prohibit the use of sunbeds on a sunbed premises by persons under 18 years of age and will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include: (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises; (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age; (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises; (iv) an exemption for medical purposes; (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE; (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users; (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises; (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices; (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the drafting of this legislation.  It is important to bear in mind that the Bill, when finalised, must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive <i>prior</i> to the publication and introduction of the Bill in the Oireachtas.  This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

Mental health social workers carry out a range of functions as members of multidisciplinary Community Mental Health Teams.  Case management involves the integration of health services with a range of other services including, housing, social welfare, job training and employment, liaison with statutory and voluntary agencies etc.  The National Service User Executive also has a role in assisting service users along with other agencies such as Citizens Information services which provides an Advocacy service to persons with a disability, to support those people in accessing their entitlements such as rent allowances etc.  In addition, individuals, while in-patients in acute mental health units, have access to a Peer Advocate who will provide information and support.</p><p>  The Department of Health's statutory role is to support the Minister for Health in the formulation and evaluation of policies for the health services.  It also has a role in the strategic planning of health services.  This is carried out in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, voluntary service providers, Government Departments and other interested parties.  There is no dedicated person within the Department of Health to liaise with other Government Departments and, or, Agencies on behalf of individuals who have mental health problems and who have difficulty accessing services such as those described by the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm.  Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The fluoride currently used is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2).  It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.</p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.</p></reply>

The HSE also recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy. Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery. The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people and to facilitate the development of the home help service.</p><p>  While the HSE announced a reduction in the provision of home help hours as one of a number of measures required to address the significant 2012 budget deficit last October, this was subject to home help services continuing to be available to those assessed as requiring them. The HSE&rsquo;s 2013 Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.</p><p>  The number of hours worked by home help assistants varies according to service needs. Their terms and conditions were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home help assistants.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services. The parties have since met on a number of occasions in relation to contractual issues under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and this engagement is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:</p><p>  -	costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p><p>  -	price(s) previously charged,</p><p>  -	local market price, and</p><p>  -	Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  An NTPF pricing agreement is in place with the nursing home referred to by the Deputy.  It is scheduled for renewal on 1 July 2013 and NTPF are currently in contact with the proprietors concerning that renewal.</p></reply>

The HSE National Service Plan 2013 commits to a number of objectives including the further development of suicide prevention initiatives and forensic services; community mental health teams for adults, children and older persons and for mental health intellectual disability; and to the recruitment of 477 additional staff to implement these measures.  </p><p>  In order to ensure that the additional resources will be used to best effect, the HSE, in consultation with the Department of Health, is working towards finalising the allocation of these resources.  Business cases from each HSE Region are being finalised and examined, against each of the identified objectives, detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.  It is expected that this process will be concluded in the very near future with a view to recruitment of the additional staff proceeding as soon as possible. 384 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recruitment process for the new posts being funded in 2013 and any outstanding posts from the 414 approved in 2012 is being given priority within the HSE.</p><p>  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention recognises the youth sector as a high risk group and sets out a number of specific actions.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.   </p><p>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  This includes an additional &euro;1 million from the &euro;35 million allocation for 2013 (above).  The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.</p><p>The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the  most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of <i>Reach Out,</i>  our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention which runs until 2014.  I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.</p><p>  This reviewed approach will build on progress made to date, which includes the provision of awareness and training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), National Mental Health Awareness Campaigns as well as the Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health &amp;amp; Suicide Prevention which were jointly developed with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011, charges apply for in-patient services other than for acute hospital care and for long-term residential care services supported under the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Fair Deal), both of which are subject to separate charging regimes. Under these Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for longer than 30 days over a rolling 12 month period. <b></b>Charges apply whether or not the person has full or limited eligibility. </p><p>  I understand that directions to ensure the uniform application of the existing legislation on charges for in-patient respite care services across all HSE areas were circulated by the HSE at the end of March 2013 for implementation with immediate effect. This development brought areas that were not charging for in-patient respite care services into line with other areas that were already charging for such services. As a result, and in the interests of fairness and equity, in-patient respite care charges have now been implemented in all areas on a standard and consistent basis in  accordance with the legislation in place since 2005.</p><p>  The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension. The Regulations currently provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.  The charging legislation provides that the HSE may reduce or waive charges where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to individual financial circumstances (including whether there are dependants).</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The current Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA. The standards have been submitted to my Department for approval and I expect that they will be formally approved shortly with a likely publication and launch of the standards next month.    </p><p>  Work is also underway in the Department on both the &lsquo;Registration and Inspection&rsquo; regulations and the &lsquo;Care and Welfare&rsquo; regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned with the introduction three years ago of similar regulations for nursing homes.</p><p>  It is expected that the new regulatory regime should be up and running by quarter three this year.  This timescale, however, is subject to final agreement on the staffing and resources required in addition to the necessity to recruit and train the inspectorate staff in time for the commencement of the regulatory regime.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the required staff are in place to commence registration and inspection of this sector later this year.  </p><p>  It is also important to point out that while the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with these standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector. </p></reply>

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.</p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:</p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;</p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;</p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;</p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.</p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Last December, the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i>   case.

Beechpark is a regional HSE service which provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The service has to operate within the financial and other parameters applying.</p><p>  Importantly, the Beechpark service is working with local implementation groups to progress disability services for children and young people across the HSE's Dublin north-east and Dublin-mid-Leinster areas.  They are focussing on the current service model and service delivery structure provided by all service providers in the area, with a view to addressing the realignment of resources in the context of the report of the national reference group, the national review of autism services report and the progressing disability services programme.  This issue is also being examined by the independent Dublin Beechpark service review group.</p><p>  While the current economic position presents challenges in how best to maximise the provision of services with available resources, I am committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest extent possible.  In that context, I have raised my concerns with the HSE regarding staff rotation and the impact of the public sector recruitment moratorium on front-line staff, especially therapists.  I will also continue to work closely with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to address this matter. </p></reply>

This held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  A termination of pregnancy arising from a risk to life from suicide was deemed lawful under this judgment.</p><p>  Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there are mental health risks - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i> case.  The aim of the Bill is to bring clarity and certainty in relation to the process for the determination of whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible on the basis that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman as a result of that pregnancy.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: <i>.</i>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes. </p></reply>

While my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups in coming together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice in so far as is possible.  There are a number of issues still to be clarified, however.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.</p><p>  Officials of my Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available. They will work through the outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed with a view to achieving regulation of the profession as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.  I would like to emphasise that while counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are of course subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.</p></reply>

The increased funding for the RTP has led to increases in the level of services provided rising from 40,000 services in 2003 to 217,686 services in 2012.  The number of passenger journeys recorded on those services also increased from 151,000 in 2003 to 1.73 million in 2012.</p><p>  Since 1<sup>st</sup> April 2012 the National Authority (NTA has been managing the Programme with Pobal administering it on the NTA's behalf.</p><p><b>  Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP</b></p><p>- The RTP was selected for a Value for Money and Policy Review in line with a commitment given at the launch of the Programme in 2007.  The Review covered the period 2002 to 2009.</p><p>- Key findings of the Review include:</p><p>- Concerns over the value for money in the context of a rate of increase in Programme funding without an accompanying equivalent increase in passenger numbers or services </p><p>- The current organisational structure for delivery (35 RTP groups) is a key factor in the lack of cost efficiencies being achieved both in administration and operations</p><p>- The cost of administration has been and remains very high as a proportion of total RTP group expenditure (22% in 2009)</p><p>- Substantial increases in operating costs - between 2007 and 2009 wages and salaries doubled as a consequence of increased staffing and salary levels</p><p>- Lack of data to measure the benefits of the Programme in terms of addressing social inclusion objectives and data gaps in the framework of performance monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>  The Review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme.  The NTA was tasked with implementing the findings of the Review.</p><p>  The main recommendations of the report are:</p><p>  - Reduce overall Programme costs particularly the administration costs</p><p>  - Improve efficiency of the Programm</p><p>  - Address the status of the Programme within the context of public transport regulation in Ireland</p><p>  - Develop a detailed appraisal plan for an organisational restructuring to achieve greater programme efficiencies</p><p>  - Better alignment to be established between the voluntary county-based RTP groups involved and the Local Authorities</p><p>  Administration costs to the Programme were reduced by 33.5 % by end 2012.  Combined with the reduction in Pobal's costs, the threshold administration proportion of 17% recommended in the VfM Review was also achieved by end 2012.  In order to achieve the recommended administration costs of 13%, the proposed restructuring of the RTP is required.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.</p><p>  The RTP budget for 2014 - 2015 will be determined as part of the estimates and budgetary process for these years.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  </p><p>  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.   </p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.   </p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.   </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Transport Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding the County Donegal area or any other part of the country, but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.   </p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>
