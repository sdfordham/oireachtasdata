Many people who have contacted me have recognised an issue with their septic tank and are cognisant of the prospect of it contaminating groundwater sources.  As a result, they have sought the grant assistance that was portrayed by the Government as being available for those who wished to rectify such a situation.  However, it appears one must be lucky enough to win a lottery in the local authority by virtue of the fact that the septic tank must have been tested and failed the test before one can apply for assistance.  Will the Minister examine ways and means by which eligibility might be extended?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600003#A00500"><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic wastewater treatment systems which were deemed, following inspection under the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s national inspection plan and the subsequent issue of an advisory notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.  The qualification criteria are set out in the legislation and full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The grants scheme ensures the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the implementation of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  I have no plans to extend or vary the qualifying criteria of the scheme.  However, householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria included in the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013 but who wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the home renovation incentive scheme introduced under section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.  The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on their website, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that if somebody's septic tank is contaminating a water source and he or she contacts Irish Water or the local authority with a view to rectifying the matter, as he or she does not have the funds available to him or her to do so, despite the perception that funding is available in the form of a grant from the Government or the local authority, that is not the case.  Local authorities and Irish Water are putting their hands to their ears, nobody is rectifying the position and the contamination continues.  The cost to the taxpayer will be far greater in the future.  The Minister says there is a grants system available, but there is not.  One needs to have six numbers in the lotto.  The local authority must test the septic tank, but there could be 5,000 septic tanks registered in its area.  The householder's must be one of the six that are tested and one of the six that fail in order that he or she can qualify for a grant.  That is not at all what it says on the tin.  The perception does not meet the reality.  It is time the reality met the perception and that an effort was made by the Government to adhere to the wishes of those who wish to rectify the problem and ensure there will be no contamination of water sources.</p></speech>

It had to be put in place as a result of a European Court decision.  Under the plan in place and working through the EPA and the local authorities, 1,000 inspections are taking place every year.  By and large, local authorities have kept up with the level of inspections they were required to undertake.  Incidentally, this is a minimum inspection level.  If local authorities wish to increase the level of inspection, they can do so.  Some are considering doing this.  Regarding the inspections that have taken place, well over half of the septic tanks inspected have been found to be compliant.  A considerable number of the rest just need to have normal maintenance carried out such as de-sludging and so forth.  In the case of the remainder, additional work is required.  Those who wish to do so apply for the grant that is available, but, given the income thresholds, obviously some will not qualify.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600003#A00900"><p>I am far from happy.  The scheme was portrayed as something it was not.  When people who have difficulties with their septic tank go to the local authority to ask if they can access the grant, they are told they cannot.  They must be one of the lucky ones to have their septic tank tested in the first instance and it must have failed the test.  The Minister says there are thousands of inspections taking place.  I will put a question to his Department in the coming weeks to ascertain exactly how many there are because it is minimal.  The drawdown of funding is probably minimal also, to say the least.  However, when the scheme was introduced, the impression was given that the grant would be available.  Some of my constituents have come forward to avail of it, but, unfortunately, they cannot do so.  There is no grants system in place for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600003#A01000"><p>This is all in the public domain.  The plan sets out that 1,000 inspections will take place.</p><p>By and large local authorities are meeting the target of 1,000 inspections in total across the country.  This is what was deemed achievable within the limited resources available at the time this was set out.  On top of that, the Deputy must be aware that there is an evidence-based approach to these inspections.  The system that has been developed in conjunction with the EPA targets areas where there are perceived to be issues.  It is a fairly sophisticated system.  There are over 400,000 septic tanks in the country.  If the Deputy is asking whether a scheme should be put in place so that every one of those can be delivered on immediately, that is not realistic.  There is an alternative, though, through the home renovation scheme, which I have already outlined to the Deputy.  This is an option for all other householders if they have brought the matter to the attention of the local authority, have not been inspected and still want to do something about it.  However, I would perceive that a household that has an issue with a septic tank and brings it to the attention of the local authority would be one of, as the Deputy calls them, the lucky few.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600004#B00500"><p>I note the comments of ICTU.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, now Ervia, conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Water Services Act 2013, as amended by Section 46 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, prohibits each of the shareholders of Irish Water &ndash; the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Finance and Ervia - from disposing of its shareholding in Irish Water and thus places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water.  To further strengthen this protection of the State&rsquo;s ownership of the company, section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that in the highly unlikely event of any proposal for legislation being brought forward at any future stage that would involve a change in the State ownership of Irish Water, the matter would have to be put to a plebiscite of the people.  Accordingly, an amendment to the Constitution to prevent the privatisation of Irish Water is not necessary.</p>  <p>  Section 21 of the Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides that Irish Water is required to charge customers for the provision by it of water services and that customers of Irish Water are required to pay the charges.  The charges are subject to the approval of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The Water Services Act 2014 provides that the maximum charge for a household will be &euro;160 for a household with one adult and &euro;260 for other households until the end of 2018.  Provision is also made for charges to continue to be capped thereafter.  I am satisfied that this charging structure provides a clear, certain and affordable way of ensuring that the necessary investment can be secured for our vital water services infrastructure.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that ICTU, the body representing organised labour in this State, took a very strong position in Ennis and called for the abolition of water charges.  It also supported the position I put forward in a Bill earlier this year regarding having a referendum to prevent the privatisation of water services unless the people so decided.  I accept that it was put in legislation and that this is a step in the right direction, which was taken under huge pressure.  However, that can be changed, as the Minister knows.  The next Government, if it is so willed, can do that.  I would not advise it to do so, but it could.  That shows there is broad support from workers who have really taken a hit in the last four or five years-----</p></speech>

I also note that there was a broad discussion on it and it was not unanimous.  There were many different discussions and different views on it, particularly from many different unions, one of which I am a member of.  Under no circumstances will Irish Water ever be privatised.  The provisions are in place to ensure that does not happen.  As a member of Government, I have to take cognisance of legal advice at all times from the Attorney General.  We have put in place enough checks and balances to ensure that in the very unlikely event that somebody else sitting over here proposed to do that, it would not be possible.  I believe the people are satisfied with that.</p></speech>

I heard what the Minister said about being a member of one of the unions.  The facts are that here we have organised labour coming out strongly on this matter.  Very few decisions are unanimous.  Ordinary workers are seeing that they have taken a huge hit and here is another hit.  Regarding the battle of hearts and minds, there is a problem here for the Government.  Looking at the figures released yesterday, it does not matter how it is dressed up, just over four out of ten have paid.</p></speech>

How can the Minister give a guarantee that Irish Water cannot ever be privatised?  All it needs is a change in legislation.

He can say what he wants.  I have heard him numerous times saying that a future Government could just change the legislation.  However, it would also have to decide to take away a decision to put it to the will of the people.  It would be some Government that would actually do that.  When one sits on this side of the House, one has to take legal advice on all occasions on decisions like this.  As a Government, we have put in place every possible check and balance to guarantee that this will not happen.  I look around both here and in the Seanad and I have not seen many people walk through these doors who would advocate doing what Deputy Stanley just said could happen, privatising Irish Water.</p></speech>

We know the market rents are, in most cases, higher, and sometimes significantly higher, than the capped rents, yet the scheme is supposed to be limited to the levels of the current rent caps as it relates to rent assistance.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme removes a barrier to employment, by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, it improves regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and it provides certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p>  <p>  HAP has been rolled out to all categories of households in 13 local authority areas.  There are now over 2,600 households in receipt of HAP and a further cohort of local authorities will commence HAP on an incremental basis later this year.  While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continue to rise, with an average of 100 new tenancies being registered each week at present.</p><p>Regulations prescribe the maximum rent limits that apply in each local authority area where HAP has commenced.  The limits are based on the rent supplement limits set out by the Department of Social Protection.  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are also taken into consideration.  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in this regard and monitors the data gathered by HAP pilot authorities.  In this context, I have recognised that South Dublin County Council requires additional flexibility in the operation of HAP given the challenging rental market within its administrative area.  Regulations will be signed very shortly to provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the previous maximum rent limits in south Dublin where such flexibility is necessary in order to secure a suitable dwelling for a relevant household.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I will continue to keep this matter under active review.</p></speech>

That is exactly the point I am trying to get to.  HAP has the advantage of taking that poverty trap out of the system, which I acknowledge, but in fact it could end up being a very costly solution by virtue of the fact that the rent caps are being negotiated up on a case-by-case basis.  In my area, the rent cap is &euro;750 but we negotiate on a case-by-case basis every day.  If we do not, in the region of 1,200 to 1,300 people will end up homeless.  It is significantly above the cap and the 20% the Minister of State is talking about will be very challenging in terms of getting additional properties for the scheme.  Obviously, it does not deal with the supply side issue at all.  Has the Government costed into the 2020 strategy the actual situation rather than the situation as it would like to find it in terms of the caps and market rents?</p></speech>

South Dublin County Council reported that the successful implementation of the scheme was being hampered due to the shortage of available accommodation for eligible households within the rent limits which apply.  We recognised that there was a need for greater discretion and flexibility in that particular case.  Currently, we do not have plans to extend the flexibility to other local authorities, but we are continually reviewing and monitoring the situation in those areas.  We are committed in government to making HAP work and increasing numbers are joining the scheme.  We will keep it under active review as local authorities come forward.  If they make the case, the matter will be considered at that stage.</p></speech>

Fingal, Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are all going to be a huge challenge.  Has the Government actually looked at where people are coming into the scheme?  Are they coming into the scheme in areas that pose less of a challenge?  Is HAP really going to require very significant increases for the areas that are under the kind of rental pressure we see in the major urban centres?</p></speech>

HAP is one solution to address the housing demand that is there.  With regard to rent limits, I have outlined that where the case is made and there is a real need, as in South Dublin County Council's functional area, we have applied the flexibility and discretion.  Local authorities will vary in terms of the success of HAP and the demands on it.  Substantial gains have been made in the pilot local authority areas in Limerick, Donegal and Kilkenny.  A number of new local authorities just joined the scheme on 14 July and are at the very early stages.  It is something to which I am committed to keeping under active review.  We are committed to having a successful HAP scheme because we depend on it.  If the demand arises, we will continue to engage with the Department of Social Protection and its officials and address it in due course.</p></speech>

The Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2014&ndash;20 will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of rural communities.  Under stage one of the selection process for the new programme, any entity wishing to be considered as a local action group was invited to submit an expression of interest.  For the purposes of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and 45 separate expressions of interest were received.  A single expression of interest was received in 19 of the 28 areas and at least two expressions of interest were received in the remaining nine areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I established an independent evaluation committee to evaluate the expressions of interest received.  The evaluation committee recently met and the following is the current position.  Of the 45 expressions of interest received, one was formally withdrawn before assessment.  Of the remaining 44, 42 met the minimum criteria and the evaluation committee decided that these should proceed to the next stage of the process, which is the preparation of local development strategies for their areas.  Those who were successful in this process have been notified and invited to attend workshops and presentations in Tullamore, County Offaly, this morning.  The purpose of the event is to set out in detail what is expected in terms of the content and quality of local development strategies.  A minimum of six months will be allowed for the preparation of local development strategies, but I expect that not all areas will require the full six months to prepare them.  As such, I am hopeful that many areas will have their strategies approved and be in a position to begin delivery on the ground by autumn 2015.</p>  <p>  In areas where a single strategy is submitted, the evaluation committee will review and evaluate these strategies with a view to ensuring that they meet the required standard.  In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the evaluation committee to make a decision on which local development strategy best meets the needs of a particular community.  In this situation, the evaluation committee will not make a decision on the successful strategy until all strategies for that sub-regional area have been submitted for assessment.</p></speech>

That means that where we have one strategy, it could be ready for appraisal at the end of September.  Allowing in reality for six to eight weeks for evaluation and getting a strategy to the Minister of State for her approval, we are talking about having the early starters at the end of November.  My experience tells me that is realistically the kind of timeframe in which we are working.</p><p>If there are two strategies the slower of the two could take up to six months and everything will wait until it is submitted.

Entities successful at stage one have been invited to go to stage two, which is the local development strategy development phase.  All entities invited to submit a local development strategy will be provided with a comprehensive template to assist in the development process.  We are working very hard.  More than &euro;12 million has been allotted to County Galway.  Those working on this are very pragmatic people and, like me, they will want to get their hands on the money.  It will be in their interest not to slow down the process but to get the prize at the end of the development strategy.  The quicker they have a development strategy the quicker we will draw down the money.  Most communities would want to see this happen.  It is not in anybody's interest to slow down anything in these areas deliberately.</p></speech>

If this happens, they will have to wait.  The Minister of State mentioned County Galway and I did not, but I will take her up on it.  If there were two bidders in County Galway each would have to submit a plan for the entirety of County Galway and they could not submit a plan for part of County Galway.  There would be two or three plans for the whole area.  Each bid must cover the whole declared area, such as all of County Leitrim or all of County Galway.  A plan cannot be submitted for a sub-area.  Will the Minister of State confirm this because it is important?  In any area with competing bids, the slowest bid will determine the timescale up to six months.  This seems to indicate that by the time contracts are signed and all the formalities are done, it will be next year.  I take it the single bid counties could be three months faster.</p></speech>

I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact communities want this money drawn down.  The faster the local development strategy is submitted the better.  The independent evaluation committee will make its decision on the strategies and we will leave it to its expert view as to how local development strategies meet the criteria.  It will be the local development strategy that best serves the needs of the community which will be chosen.  The local development committees are working very hard on the strategies and we are looking forward to see what they will come forward with.</p></speech>

The Central Statistics Office is responsible for all engagement with EUROSTAT on such matters, and the Department has engaged with this office and has provided the necessary information to facilitate this work.  As the Deputy is well aware, because we have discussed it numerous times in the Chamber, they are independent bodies which do their work independently of Departments.  The CSO has confirmed it has submitted a classification proposal on Irish Water to EUROSTAT and that the proposal envisages Irish Water being classified outside the general government sector.  The CSO has further stated this is a closed process and that it is awaiting the final adjudication by EUROSTAT.  When EUROSTAT will announce its decision is a matter for EUROSTAT.</p>  <p>  The Government is confident the underlying funding model for Irish Water supports increased investment in the water sector through an off-balance sheet classification of the utility, while at the same time providing for water charges which are affordable, clear and certain.  The substance and timing of the decision on the classification of Irish Water will be made by EUROSTAT alone.  It is not for me to state when it will do so.  I expect it will not be too long into the future.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, Irish Water's first quarterly billing cycle has been completed.  The utility has indicated it is satisfied with the rate of revenue collection to date and a very significant level of engagement with customers is continuing.</p></speech>

Given that four out of ten people are paying domestic water charges, it shows there will be an awful lot on balance sheet.  A total of &euro;30.5 million has been received but &euro;32.5 million has been budgeted to go out through the water conservation grant.  It does not matter how these figures are juggled or what accountancy tricks are done, the &euro;130 million water conservation grant may help the Minister to get it over the line as might the write-off of &euro;59 million in rates, which will fall back on the public purse, and a number of other accountancy tricks which are being worked-----</p></speech>

We know what is coming in is one tenth of what were projected to be the costs this time last year, which was &euro;300 million.  If the Minister remembers, just before the Government pushed the Commission for Energy Regulation out of the way, it was stated &euro;300 million was to be brought in this year through domestic water charges.  There is massive subvention, with &euro;339 million in operating costs, &euro;222 million in capital costs, &euro;59 million in offsetting of rates, and &euro;130 million in the water conservation grant.  Does the Minister realise what he has put onto the balance sheet from Irish Water?  A total of &euro;810 million is all on the balance sheet.  It is Alice in Wonderland economics.  Is it not the case the only way Irish Water will ever be able to cover the cost is either through massive subsidy, such as the &euro;810 million going to it this year, or by increasing the cost massively on the far side of the general election?</p><p>The Minister has given an assurance that costs will not increase until the end of 2018.  How will Irish Water get from here to the end of 2018, given the figures released yesterday?</p></speech>

People will pay their bills.  That is how Irish Water will get there and how the model will work.  I have no plans to increase anything post the general election, now that the Deputy has raised the issue, considering that I have put this model in place.  The Deputy does not like the information, but the billing period for which statistics were released yesterday covered April, May and June.  In some cases, people only received their bills a few weeks ago.  The average period of time in which people pay their bills is three to four months.  I know that does not suit the Deputy's theory and thinking, but the idea that everyone should pay his or her bills immediately to suit his belief system is unrealistic.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the tremendous efforts made by the Minister and the Minister of State in this regard, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the issue is much larger than was anticipated.  It was inherited from a previous era, which is unfortunate, and came at a very bad time.  This might be a good time to examine whether the measures already taken are sufficient to deal with the issue.</p></reply>

This will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.</p>  <p>  I set ambitious targets for local authorities for the period 2015 to  2017 in my announcement on 1 April 2015, with an investment of &euro;1.5 billion in a combination of building, purchase and leasing schemes which will accommodate 25% of those currently on social housing waiting lists.  On 5 May I announced funding of &euro;312 million to support 100 separate housing projects, providing 1,700 units of accommodation across all 31 local authorities.  I will make further announcements, with the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, in the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, a shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing the issue on a number of fronts.  Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing bottlenecks that might impede the construction sector in meeting demand.  My Department, in particular the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, is leading on a range of actions under Construction 2020, including two significant pieces of planning legislation, one of which, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, is progressing through the Oireachtas, as the Deputy is aware.</p>  <p>  My overriding objective in regard to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.  The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measure proposed is balanced and will have the desired effect on the rental market, while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.  Ultimately, any decision on rent certainty is a matter for the Government.  It is my intention to bring proposals to the Government for consideration in the very near future.</p></speech>

I appreciate and fully support the measures take to date.  My only problem is the extent to which he has been able to identify, in respect of the various local authorities, in particular in the greater Dublin area, the number of houses acquired, purchased or built with a view to allocating them immediately.  In County Kildare alone, about 600 houses are required to address the housing emergency.  It would not solve the problem, but it would be a major step in the right direction.  I, therefore, ask the Minister whether it is possible to re-examine the extent to which local authorities have the facilities and ability to urgently deal with the question.</p></speech>

I will not deny that everyone knows that there are issues regarding housing.  It is probably the biggest priority in my Department and the main reason I took this job.  There is a legacy issue.  It is like stopping a ship from turning to face the opposite direction and getting it moving again because the policies in place for a number of years had to be rescinded and changed to allow houses to be built once again.  I will refer to the position in Dublin and surrounding areas, including County Kildare, because that is where the need is greatest.  As late as two days ago I met in one room all local authority representatives, chief executives or senior housing representatives, depending on who was available, to outline the priorities and focus on how we needed to deliver solutions in terms of timelines and turning around developments quickly.  I have made local authorities well aware that the resources they require will be provided for them, within reason.  I will be very open to providing whatever resource allocation is required.  In excess of 350 staff have been recently allocated to local authorities.</p></speech>

Might it be possible to ask various local authorities to implement, or can the Minister set, particular objectives for them, with a view to achieving them within a two or three month period?  One cannot build a house in a day, but a means needs to be found to identify the period within which those now in a crisis might expect to access housing.</p></speech>

Not alone am I doing it, but we have measurement and management information techniques built into every decision we make.  On the allocations given across a range of areas, I have informed local authorities that within a couple of weeks we will conduct an analysis of those that are up to speed.  If they are not, funding will be taken from them and used where it is most necessary.  Local authorities which are actively providing accommodation and using the available funding will be rewarded for so doing and they deserve to be.  We will not fall below a certain threshold.  The measurements applied to local authorities have been in place for some time.  In profiling every area of expenditure local authorities are well aware that anything that may have happened in the past will no longer happen and that they will have to show results.</p></speech>

The housing assistance payment  has been rolled out to all categories of household in 13 local authority areas, including County Donegal.  There are now over 2,600 households nationally in receipt of the payment.  The payment has been operational in the administrative area of Donegal County Council since 25 May.  In the seven weeks since it has been introduced over 40 households have been accommodated under the scheme in County Donegal.  I am pleased with this progress and would like to commend the local authority for its engagement with the scheme to date.  Of the six local authorities that have been added, Donegal County Council has performed the best by far, for which the local authority deserves to be commended.</p>  <p>  The maximum rent limits for the different household classes that apply in each local authority where the housing assistance payment has been commenced are set out in regulations and are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection.  In prescribing these limits household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  In the context of implementation of the housing assistance payment, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data gathered by housing assistance payment pilot authorities for the rent limits applying and difficulties that may arise.  The operation of the housing assistance payment by Donegal County Council will be kept under active review in this context.</p></speech>

The rents are not based on the market in the local areas.  In County Donegal, this morning there were five properties available under the HAP limit for a family with one child in a county the size of Donegal with 160,000 of a population and over 2,500 on the housing lists.</p><p>The HAP limits are not high enough and they need to be increased if the Government is serious about addressing this issue.  While applicants are not turned down for being over the limit, they are still struggling to meet those rents and still have to pay the landlord the difference between the HAP limit and the amount that the local authority pays.  No doubt Donegal County Council will work the scheme well because its housing office has always been proactive.  If the Minister of State is serious about the success of this scheme, the limits need to be increased to reflect what is happening on the ground.  A simple two-minute search on <i>daft.ie</i>by the Department will show the extent of the lack of properties available within the limits of the scheme.</p></speech>

In the seven weeks since the HAP has been rolled out, and it is only the second wave of HAP local authorities of which Donegal is one, over 40 households have been accommodated.  That, in itself, proves it is working quite well in Donegal.</p>  <p>  We have ambitious targets for the HAP.  With the Department of Social Protection, my Department will be monitoring closely the rent limits.  We actively review that constantly.  As I explained earlier to Deputy Catherine Murphy, in South Dublin County Council, where it was proven to us that there was a strong demand for flexibility, we applied such discretion.  If that arises in other local authority areas, the same will apply.  We are keeping it under active review.</p>  <p>  Donegal is performing well and we expect it to continue to engage with many more households in the successful HAP accommodation scheme.</p></speech>

What the Minister of State says bears no reality to the situation on the ground.  I would be interested to see if he would go back and ask Donegal County Council for how many of those 40 applicants was the rent at or below the HAP limit.  That would show first-hand from the Minister of State's own officials what the situation is.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State can get an official in the Department to spend two minutes on a computer and see the position on rent limits and whether the HAP limit is suitable or not.  That would be a simple exercise for him to do and it would show that the HAP limits are not viable or realistic for anybody.</p></speech>

In the overall sense, we have ambitious targets for the HAP around the country and we are rolling it out to a number of local authorities.  The second wave has just been announced and Donegal is one of six local authorities in that second wave.  These are new applicants who are joining the scheme in the HAP and we will also be transferring recipients of rent supplement into the HAP scheme.  That will be ongoing.</p>  <p>  I have committed to the Deputy that we will review the scheme.  We actively review and evaluate how successful the scheme is in each area and if problems arise, we will engage on that basis, as has been done on South Dublin County Council.  We are committed to this and we want a successful efficient HAP scheme.  The scheme is new.  It is taking time for applicants to understand it and engage in it.  Limerick City and County Council has proven it.  It has over 400 people on the HAP scheme and is continuously engaging, as are the other local authorities, to ensure that there are more people joining the scheme, almost on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I have been briefed on it.  I visited a number of sites where remediation is getting underway and it is progressing at a rapid rate.  I expect to be reporting considerable progress over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme, which was first published by the Pyrite Resolution Board in February of 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel and the relevant provisions of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013.  The full conditions for eligibility are set out in the scheme, which is available on the board's website.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment carried out by a competent person in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material.</p>  <p>  I emphasis that the pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of last resort which aims to repair homes with substantial damage due to pyritic heave and is targeted to assist a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress.  Deputy Clare Daly has been active on this issue, as have many Deputies.  I do not want to see residents left in the lurch.  I have seen the distress that it has caused to many families.</p>  <p>  In the first year of the scheme, we were setting up the board, the housing agency and the technical staff had to be put in place, and we ran a pilot scheme before Christmas.  I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made and many tenders are being prepared so that they can be contracted out for further progress.  However, it is a scheme of last resort.  We are prioritising those that are worst affected, that is, category 2.  It is my job to ensure that this scheme is run as efficiently as possible to ensure that these residents are assisted with the problems with which they have been left due to the legacy of poor standard regulation in the building sector.  The priority is category 2, and that is where the priority will remain for the moment.</p></speech>

Inevitably, there would be teething problems.  The board is confident that it can achieve its target of having 600 houses completed by the end of next year.  I welcome that and hope it is the case.</p>  <p>  I refer to some of the issues that have emerged during the remediation works.  In some areas, when homeowners moved out, the job took longer because of structural problems that emerged in the course of the remediation of the infill or other issues that were outside the control of the homeowners.  These homeowners have had to enter into three-month leases in rented accommodation, move their post and, for example, be eligible for two water charges bills, and the idea of the works being extended beyond a couple of weeks throws that into crisis because of the inability to extend.  People do not operate on that basis.  Is the board considering that it is not reasonable to expect the homeowners in that situation to bear the extra cost?</p>  <p>  Issues have emerged about the quality of the replacement products, that they are not up to standard with what some of the homeowners had in terms of flooring, house decoration, etc.  That needs to be looked at.  In particular, there is the issue of the need to change the scheme away from being purely damage-based.  Once the scheme gets up and running, we must look at those who have pyrite with less damage.</p></speech>

It is not before time.  I am committed to ensuring we give it full focus and priority over the coming months.  As I said, I expect substantial progress to be made now as more homes are remediated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in saying that some issues are coming to light when the mediation crews are moving onto site where they are discovering further defects, in terms of substandard building and construction works.  This is something about which we need to be careful, first and foremost, because the pyrite resolution scheme is essentially to deal with the pyrite-related issues only.  As other substandard work arises, it is important that it is highlighted as early as possible after it is discovered.  The remediation crews have a responsibility to ensure that no house is handed back in a dangerous or substandard condition.</p><p>It is not appropriate that the cost of remediating other structural works that have nothing to do with pyrite should fall back on the taxpayer.  That would give rise to all kinds of issues, not just concerning pyrite, right around the country.  The scheme is a scheme of last resort.  We are conscious that other issues arise.  We are working with the homeowners through the project managers to ensure the issues are addressed as appropriately as possible.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the Minister of State has done any work on this.  He is correct that some of these matters are very serious.  While the taxpayer should not be liable under this scheme, the homeowner should not be either.</p>  <p>  With regard to the basis of the scheme and the idea that it is connected with damage, the board has asked what the problem is if one's house is not damaged.  If there is pyrite, the house will get damaged.  One cannot build an extension and one cannot sell the house, decorate it or put in a new floor.  One cannot move the house.  Therefore, there needs to be a system that captures those people who have pyrite that may result in problems.  There needs to be some way to alleviate the burden of testing so those concerned might be able to get a green certificate after a certain period.  If there is to be no oxidisation and further damage, the homeowner needs to be able to show this.  Unless the problem is remediated or the homeowner gets a green certificate, he or she cannot move on.  We are talking about tens of thousands of homeowners.  This will have to be addressed, probably sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

However, I am conscious of many of the issues that arise.  I have met many of the householders who have concerns.  They do not know whether they have pyrite in their houses.  Core testing is the only way this can be decided upon.  I appreciate that it is costly but our funds are going towards remediation.</p>  <p>  As I said to the householders, I do not want to leave anybody behind who has been affected by pyrite.  The Government has committed to addressing this but the scheme is one of last resort.  I will work with the homeowners to determine whether we can find solutions.  As I said to them, the more houses that are remediated, the closer we will be to dealing with their issues.  I mean that and do not want to leave anybody behind.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to HomeBond.  It is on the record and I have no problem saying that HomeBond did not cover itself in glory regarding this issue.  If other structural defects are found &mdash; some are arising &mdash; it will be open to the homeowners or other householders to pursue HomeBond or any other insurance company or builder associated with the building.  We cannot let this fall back on the taxpayer.  It is completely separate from the pyrite remediation scheme.</p></speech>

One day I tried to pin him down and asked him how many septic tanks would be inspected.  He said that one in eight would probably be inspected.  I asked about the other seven.  Whatever about inspecting the other seven, the inspection of one in eight is a long way off also.  We have serious problems.

Census 2011, published by the Central Statistics Office, indicates there were 21,242 septic tanks and 4,369 individual treatment systems in County Wexford in 2011.  Those are the facts.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory body for the purpose of meeting the objectives of the National Inspection Plan 2015-2017: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems.  The plan is managed and implemented by the local authorities. The plan underpins the risk-based inspection of septic tanks and other on-site treatment systems.  My Department does not have any direct role in monitoring the implementation of the EPA's plan by the local authorities . However, the plan has been drawn up to best international standards and I am satisfied the risk-based inspection system is consistent with the necessity to ensure compliance with the provisions of the EU waste directive and the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009.  It also has regard to the European Parliament and Council&rsquo;s recommendations of 4 April 2001 regarding the minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the member states.</p>  <p>  Inspections are objective, evidence based and aimed at identifying septic tanks and similar treatment systems that are a risk to public health or the environment.  The EPA has set the minimum number of inspections to be carried out in the years 2015 to 2017 at 1,000 nationally per annum.  It is important to note this is the recommended minimum number and there is nothing preventing a local authority from carrying out more inspections than the recommended minimum should it consider it necessary or appropriate to do so.</p></speech>

The local authority inspected 54 tanks in the first year and it hopes to inspect 104 this year.  At this rate, it will take over 200 years to inspect all septic tanks.  I said initially and it is a fact that half the tanks in Wexford are faulty.  Therefore, we are poisoning the water table.  This system must change.  At present, one cannot request an inspection even if one knows there is a problem with it, and third party complaints are being ignored.  If one carries out the work oneself, one cannot apply for a grant retrospectively.  The fact is that if one is not on the council system, one cannot possibly qualify for a grant.  This is not a good structure and the Minister would find it hard to stand over it.  He did not invent it and I am not saying it is his fault, but I believe a new structure needs to be put in place.  The contamination of the water table is a serious issue.  The Department of Health should be seriously concerned about it.</p></speech>

I remember the debate on this although I was not centrally involved.  There were many Deputies in the House who opposed the inspection process, although I am not saying Deputy Wallace did.  The plan is in place and it predates my term of office, but I now have responsibility for it.  There is an agreed plan in place for the period 2015 to 2017.  As part of that, we will be reviewing in 2016 how it will work from the following year onwards.  I am certainly committed to this analysis.</p>  <p>  The 1,000 inspections resulted in no issues in approximately half the cases.  Of the 500 odd with issues, half had only sludging issues or small issues.  The remainder have some work to be done.  These are rough figures.</p>  <p>  There is a plan in place for the period 2015 to 2017 and it is evidence based.  With regard to considering changes, I agree with the Deputy regarding self-referrals to local authorities from 2017.  Local authorities can inspect more tanks than the designated minimum.</p></speech>

I believe the local authority would inspect more septic tanks if it had them.  Let me outline a big problem with the evidence-based system.  Many tanks built in the early years &mdash; I built many of them &mdash; were built according to the planning conditions laid down and agreed by the local authority but they are not right.  We have built many of the tanks incorrectly but we did not know at the time.</p>  <p>  In the past few years, the raised-bed idea was introduced.  The idea behind this was that one would import soil that could actually take the bacteria out of the water before it reached the water table.  However, one needs good quality topsoil to take the bacteria out of the water.  Good topsoil was very expensive and importing it was even more expensive.  Transport is even more expensive than the soil itself.  This meant people did not import the soil and instead created a raised bed with the soil already in the land.  Was that cheating?  It was, but the practice was prevalent.  I know for a fact that there are many cases of it in Wexford.  Those concerned will not even be caught in the risk-based assessment.  A lot of thinking must be done on this.  The Government will have to spend more on it or we will continue to have a contaminated water table, which I believe is directly linked to the high rate of cancer in Ireland.</p></speech>

Given his previous occupation, he has much direct evidence and knowledge of this subject.</p><p>The plan that is in place has been signed up to for 2015 to 2017.  I am not afraid of change or of looking at some things a second or third time.  I am not that type of person.  I am committed to dealing with issues if I see them.</p> <p> The Deputy asked a specific question about resources.  I have allocated almost 350 staff across local authorities over recent months.  If there is a specific issue relating to perceived water contamination in some counties and they look for resources, I must look at that.  If the Deputy tells me or the local authority writes to me to say it believes it needs additional resources because of concerns it has, I must look at that.  That goes for any local authority.  If it is perceived there is a particular issue in a region or location such as the south east and if the local authorities make a submission to me, I must consider it.</p></speech>

Consequently, the Minister and I wrote to the chief executives of each of the four Dublin local authorities regarding the preparation and finalisation of the new development plans for their areas.  The letter requested the local authorities to focus on practical measures for inclusion in the development plans to boost housing supply and ensure good quality housing in suitable locations is available at prices that people can afford and that investors will find attractive to develop for the rental market.</p>  <p>  Current indications are that viability of new housing construction in Dublin, although improving, remains in a very fragile condition.  Therefore, it is essential that the development plan places the viability of development and early delivery as a high priority.  Requiring particular or proprietary forms of housing construction or large setback distances of existing housing from new apartments will increase development costs and result in higher house prices and rents. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the letter is not to compromise quality or standards.  Indeed, it should be clearly understood and I want to emphasise that the building standards in this country respect and meet all relevant EU requirements.  The intent of our letter is to encourage the local authorities concerned to ensure the development plan process supports the viability of new development through rigorous economic and regulatory impact assessment of any new or existing development plan standards that are above relevant national minimum requirements.</p></speech>

It is fine as long as the standards end up being good standards and we do not end up paying money in the future for cutting back on something on which we should not have cut back.  Insulation standards are an example.  We do not want to end up with a situation where we have to retrofit storage in apartments.  It can be very offputting and expensive for families.  Families frequently have to sell baby stuff and then buy it again when a new baby arrives because there is no place to store things.  Setback distances can be really important if buildings are higher so that one does not lose light, which can be very unattractive and unhealthy for people.  I am looking to explore this aspect.</p></speech>

We already have minimum standards in this country and we comply with EU requirements.  This is about ensuring we have development that is sustainable and affordable and that the construction of housing from the concept to design to planning to construction is affordable.  Otherwise, we will price ourselves out of the market.  I recognise that we need good quality development plans that are sustainable and the Deputy is right to raise this issue in the House.</p>  <p>  She asked what unreasonable and excessive requirements we were referring to.  One area that has been highlighted to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was the inclusion of the passive housing standard as a minimum energy performance requirement.  I have no issue with housing construction standards being as high and efficient as possible and believe they should be encouraged, but we need to careful that we are not overly prescriptive or restrictive in our county and city development plans.  It is important that issues such as the location of apartments are more appropriately considered in the individual planning application.  There is nothing stopping local authorities from applying conditions rather than having overall restrictive or prescriptive conditions in a county or city development plan.  In other words, one has belts and braces when one does not need them because they will add to cost and restrict housing output, which is not something any of us wants to see.</p></speech>

This is a counter-argument to not setting that out.  We should seek not to have to end up doing or reversing things in the future.  Has the Government looked at other elements of the cost of building other than the standards?  I presume it has.  What evidence does the Minister of State have that what is happening in these particular local authorities is driving those costs up?</p></speech>

We have utilised expertise in the Housing Agency, which has carried out a deep analysis of the cost of delivering on housing units.  We have addressed other areas that have added to cost.  We debated some of those in the House last week during the debate on the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill.  Overheads like development contributions under Part V were very high in the past.  We are giving local authorities flexibility to reduce these.  This is just one way in which we are trying to reduce costs.</p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that we are not trying to undermine what are already quality standards in building construction in this country.  What we are warning against is having standards that are over and above what is in place, that may not be necessary and that may restrict any application that comes before a local authority.  We want to ensure we boost housing construction and increase the output.  If we restrict that in any way, we will all have a right to complain.  It is important that our Department's efforts to tackle any impediments or barriers are addressed.  We are writing in good faith to those local authorities to ask them to take that on board.</p></speech>

The main amendment is the refinement of the definition of &quot;debt&quot; and the new definition of &quot;credit&quot;.  It is important that the meaning of these terms is made clear in the Bill.  They give effect to the decision to exclude from the scope of the Bill consumer debts owed to financial institutions or licensed moneylenders and arising from loans.  All of these debts are excluded from the scope of the Bill.  The reason for the exclusion is that these debts are different in nature from other civil debts.  There are other mechanisms available to deal with them.  </p><p>The other amendments are required to further improve the drafting of the Bill.  Like most Bills, it is part of the drafting process, from which quite a few technical amendments follow on.</p></speech>

The Bill currently makes reference to the service of documents by the court or that notifications are made to the court when a debtor changes employment.  However, this approach is not consistent and, on further reflection, examining other civil law matters in which documents are served on one party by another, I have decided to change it.  The court will not be involved in such matters and these amendments address this issue, which a number of Deputies have raised.</p><p><b></b>Amendment No 9 inserts the definition of &ldquo;personal public service number&rdquo;, PPSN, into the Bill.  Amendment No. 21 makes clear that the documents served on the debtor under section 6 shall be accompanied by a statement of the debtor&rsquo;s means.  Amendment No. 24 is related and clarifies the intention of section 7(2)(c) regarding the statement of means. </p><p>Amendment No. 25 provides for service of the statement of means on the judgment creditor by the judgment debtor rather than the court and, where applicable, the verifying certificate attached to the statement of means.  Importantly, it provides that the debtor&rsquo;s PPSN is not to be disclosed to the creditor.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 26, 37, 50, 53 and 57 are consequential technical amendments.  Amendment No. 35<b></b>substitutes section 11 of the Bill with new text which sets out clearly the requirements for the service of documents in relation to an attachment of earnings order made under section 10.  The judgment creditor, and not the court, serves the order on the person to whom it is directed.  Amendment No. 40<b><i></i></b>removes the reference in section 13(3) to notifying the court.  The debtor&rsquo;s new employer is required to notify the creditor, not the court.</p><p>That is the description of the servicing of documents, who is responsible and how it is to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600015#N00200"><p>I object in particular to amendment No. 25 and the related amendments.  As the Bill currently stands, it is quite clear that the court shall not disclose a verifying certificate to the judgment creditor concerned.  Amendment No. 25 provides that the judgment creditor would end up with the statement of means of the creditor.  It gives more power to the creditor over the debtor than is currently contained in the Bill.  For that reason, I will oppose the amendment.</p>  <p>  The amendment is in line with the general approach of the Government, which is to attempt to use this legislation to bully people into paying water charges in particular.  Although this legislation predates the water charges and originally had nothing to do with them, it is being used as an excuse to try to drive the water charges home.  Of course, the Government had quite a problem yesterday when the efficiency of its bullying was revealed to be relatively low.  It is very pleasant to finish the parliamentary term on a note of agreement with the Minister for water charges, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Despite all of our disagreements throughout the year, we are both more than happy with the levels of payment of the water charges.</p>  <p>  Despite the amendments that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government are making, and despite the fact that those amendments will pass, none of this is a serious threat to the 57% of people who have not paid or to the others who will now join them.  There are no direct deductions from wages, social welfare or pensions.  There are no deductions whatsoever until two court cases take place.  The first of those court cases cannot take place until someone already owes &euro;500, which takes us at least until the end of 2017 before any of this process could start from the point of view of the water charges.  They can only take a tiny percentage of non-payers to court and, between now and then, we have an election.  If over 50% of people are not paying, this will be the number one issue and there will be immense pressure on the Government to abolish the charges.</p>  <p>  I oppose the shifting of the balance of power further towards the creditor in terms of the information and statement of means.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600015#N00300"><p>Debt enforcement and recovery of moneys owed is part of any normal economic activity.  The provisions in the Bill are in line with many other countries in terms of this issue.  The Bill makes sure that those who owe money and have the capacity to pay something towards the debt should do so.</p>  <p>  On Second Stage, I went into a lot of detail on how the debtor is protected.  I repeat that this follows the Law Reform Commission recommendations.  It is one of a suite of measures for the enforcement of debt.  Clearly, there are also other mechanisms.  Before ever getting to the point where there would be an attachment, there is a series of other opportunities for the debtor to pay.  There are all the normal reminders; there is the need to go to court to get the judgment on the debt; and there are options for instalments.  There is a variety of measures for debt enforcement and recovery of moneys, and this amendment adds to them.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill will be available to a wide range of creditors and utilities, including Irish Water.  In this section, I am making very clear that the debtor's PPSN is not to be disclosed to the creditor.  That is important.  As in any court case, there will be the usual exchange of documents.  It would be inappropriate to have a blanket prohibition.  It is up to the courts.</p>  <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Murphy that this is a change in balance.  The Bill is fully balanced between creditor and debtor.  The assessment of affordability is key.  A baseline has been agreed with the Minister for Social Protection on social welfare payments.  There is an assessment of affordability, strong representation to the court by the debtor and, if the circumstances of either party change after the agreement, there is provision in the Bill to return to court and vary the order.  We will be discussing the amendments pertaining to the variability order later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600015#N00400"><p>It is clear that the purpose of the amendments is to shift the balance in favour of the creditor.  The same applies to amendment No. 50, which allows the creditor to serve the deductions order to the Department of Social Protection rather than the clerk of the court.  It is aimed at speeding up the process from the point of view of the creditor.  Under the Bill as currently drafted, the creditor does not get the statement of means, while under the Government's amendment, it will.</p>  <p>  The more general problem that the Government has is that, although there may be a variety of options to pay the water charges, people are not taking any of them.  Instead, we have this new terminology about a suite of measures designed to make people pay.  The problem is there is nothing in the suite of measures which is going to bully people into paying.  There is nothing in here, compared to all the threats about direct deductions and everything else, that can break the non-payment of 57% of people.  The likelihood is that, of the 43% who paid, there is a substantial number who are opposed to water charges but paid under threat or propaganda.  They will now see that there are no penalties for non-payment until July 2016 and Irish Water cannot do anything to get the money.  Why would they spend more money on something that is going to be abolished?  Why throw good money after bad?  It is clear that if the water charges are abolished, it is extremely unlikely they would get refunds.</p>  <p>  The figures are only going to go in one direction and it will be very difficult for the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to pronounce himself extraordinarily satisfied and delighted with them as they go up to 60% and 65% non-payment.  The Government will have a massive crisis on the issue.  All this legislation is worthless from the point of view of forcing people to pay.</p></speech>

It follows on from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</p><p>The very important aim of the Bill is to do away with the imprisonment of debtors.  That is a key principle and it is fully covered.  I have read some documentation that suggests it is not, but it is fully addressed in the Bill.  People who cannot afford to pay will not have to pay.  That is a very important principle, which is why we have the assessment of means.  The court has full authority to look at the means of a person and make very reasonable judgments on what he or she can afford.  This is straightforward legislation which allows for this.  We must deal with those who owe money but will not pay.  The Law Reform Commission in its report acknowledged the need for creditors to recover their debts, in particular where a debtor has the capacity to repay but refuses to engage meaningfully with the creditor.  That is what the Bill is about.  We are taking the LRC's report and implementing the key recommendation in relation to the imprisonment of debtors and adding to the suite of measures available by ensuring an attachment of earnings order can be made.</p></speech>

The Bill did not provide sufficient clarity on how costs which arose in an application under the Bill were to be treated.  The definition of &quot;judgment debt&quot; deals with the costs which arise in seeking the judgment order in relation to the debt.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 inserts a new definition of &quot;relevant total amount&quot; which is the total amount specified in the order as being payable under the order to the judgment creditor concerned.  Amendment No. 32 introduces this new term into section 10, which deals with the making of an attachment of earnings order.  Amendment No. 46 introduces the term in section 16, which deals with the making of a deduction from payments order.  Amendment No. 30 makes clear that it is the costs which arise in relation to an application under section 6 which are being referred to here.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 31 and 45 are similar.  Amendment No. 31 inserts a new subsection (5) in section 10 while amendment No. 45 inserts a new subsection (4) in section 16.  These new subsections make clear that an attachment of earnings order or a deduction from payments order may direct that the costs of an application under section 6 may be included in the total amount to be repaid.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 48 are similar.  They insert a new subsection (5) in section 10 and new subsection (4) in section 16.  These new subsections make clear that the amount being paid off by the debtor is still the original debt amount plus any costs which have been added on.  Amendment No. 63, which seeks to delete section 23, arises as a consequence of amendments Nos. 33 and 48.  I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that it is preferable to deal with these matters in the sections themselves and that section 23 of the Bill should be deleted as a consequence.  This relates to the costs that arise during the court case and outlines how they need to be dealt with regarding the original debt.</p></speech>

They are part of the Government's bullying, scaremongering approach.  In particular, I highlight amendments Nos. 31 and 45, relating to the costs of the court cases.  We are dealing with the costs of the second application of two court cases here being awarded against the so-called debtor.  It is about intimidating people into paying bills.  In this case, it is attempting to intimidate people into paying their water bills, which is outrageous.  Amendment No. 45 relates to pursuing those in receipt of social welfare for costs.  It is outrageous and is obviously bullying.  We will oppose the measure, the Government will pass it, but outside the D&aacute;il the Government will not be able to use it to bully people, who will know that none of it applies until after 2017, given that they must owe at least &euro;500.</p></speech>

Will it invest the much needed funding to allow post offices to develop an electronic transaction account which will afford people the option of receiving and transacting social welfare payments in the post office, either electronically or by cash?  Will she confirm that she will meet the Irish Postmasters Union as it has requested?  Two months ago she said she would change the social welfare forms that requested social welfare recipients to change to bank accounts.  Today the very same forms are on the Department&rsquo;s website.

Of the 25 closures during the Government&rsquo;s tenure, almost all have been for that exact reason.  Like other Deputies, I, too, was involved in my constituency in efforts to recruit a new postmaster or postmistress when one retired.  That is a familiar story in the post office system, of which all Members will be aware.  It might have escaped Deputy Robert Troy&rsquo;s attention that the contract for services with the Department of Social Protection is worth &euro;50 million per annum.  He suggested it was only worth half of that amount.</p></speech>

To suggest it is half that figure is pretty poor counting by somebody involved in the post office network.  That is why I asked Deputy Robert Troy if he had a personal awareness and familiarity with the post office system.  I would have expected him not just to have a researcher&rsquo;s brief but also some personal knowledge.  Post offices play an important role in urban and rural communities.</p><p>They provide important services, particularly for people who do not actually have a formal bank account.  It is not just past Fianna F&aacute;il taoisigh who do not have a formal bank account.  It is actually quite a lot of other people in this country.</p></speech>

This move is pathetic.</p>  <p>  I raised with the Taoiseach yesterday all of these issues.  How does Irish Water expect to attract investment with such a derisory level of compliance with the Government's charge?  According to one economist, at least 80% of householders would need to pay if the company were to borrow at competitive rates.  That is not going to happen.  The Government's water tax has been roundly and comprehensively rejected.  The T&aacute;naiste has heard what people are saying.  Now, it is time to act.  Abolish the charges.  Abolish Irish Water.</p>  <p>  This morning in Dublin Castle, the T&aacute;naiste claimed, mar dhea, that she wanted to listen to people's views regarding the direction of economic policy.  I do not know if that was some sort of joke, but if it was, no one is laughing.  Clearly, she has no intention of listening to anyone outside the Government about its discredited and shambolic water policy.  The people have spoken loudly, repeatedly and clearly.  They have flatly rejected its water tax.</p></speech>

The Labour Party and the T&aacute;naiste stand shoulder to shoulder with the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny and tells people they really do not care what their view is, what their struggles are or what their difficulties are - they are going to stick with this unfair charge in any event.  The financing model for this utility is now utterly undermined but the T&aacute;naiste is in cloud cuckoo land on that score as well.</p>  <p>  The subvention for Irish Water on the State balance sheet in 2015 is &euro;810 million.  Fewer than 50% of households have paid up and if the T&aacute;naiste thinks that is going to improve she is wrong as it is not going to happen.  Many people will not pay as a matter of principle, as they pay already and oppose moves towards privatisation, but a huge number of people simply cannot pay.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1198" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600021#T01800"><p>Over the past seven years, the people have struggled in many ways to come through the recession.  Throughout Ireland, people struggle with mortgages.  They are raising families in difficult situations.  I saw a report which states grocery prices have gone up approximately 70%.  People are struggling to send their kids to college.  We have property tax.  Elderly people will get 45 minutes of home help to get out of bed.  County councils cannot take on new employees even though the number of employees they have has been decimated.  We all know the state of the health service.  Each one of us in this D&aacute;il gets calls every day about the distress families are suffering.  The T&aacute;naiste told us earlier to look at where we have come from.  She is right.  Look at it.  The kick in the teeth to the people is to be found in the reports in the media telling us that top politicians and former taoisigh will now get a couple of grand extra.  They will end up with &euro;136,000 to look out the window at home and smile at Ireland.  Former Ministers will be looked after.  Just imagine it.  The rise they will get in their pensions equates to extra home care for three people.  Some of them, including the T&aacute;naiste, have said they will not accept it, which I acknowledge.  However, that is not the way to go forward.  Some of these people will give the State the two fingers.  They will run for the hills with the money in their pockets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has been asked about this situation.  What did he do?  He put his hands in the air and asked what could he do.</p>  <p>  When crises hit this country, the Government was prepared to bring in emergency legislation.  We are legislators.  We are here to solve the problems of the country.  We cannot have a family home being repossessed.  We cannot have banks closing in on families throughout the country and at the same time give &euro;2,000 to the fat cats.  I am not long a Member of the D&aacute;il but I will ask the T&aacute;naiste one thing.  Will she answer me straight?  I do not need an epitaph.  I want straight answers.  Does she agree with those increases in pensions?  Will her Government legislate to stop this immediately?  When will she bring in that legislation?</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach of this country earns less than &euro;200,000 and therefore might be in line for a pension of somewhat less than half of that, and the Taoiseach now earns significantly less than &euro;200,000, I do not see why anyone in this country-----</p></speech>

The same ding-dong goes on every day.  I look around me and no one answers a question straight.  The fact is those politicians who are gone have given the two fingers to the State.  We need to do something as legislators to stop what is going on.  Go out on the ground and listen to the people.  This is a problem with many politicians.  The Government should listen to its backbenchers.  In fairness to the backbenchers of all parties and none, behind the scenes they will say what is going on is a disgrace.</p><p>Why does the T&aacute;naiste not listen to the people on the ground who have made the sacrifices in the past six or seven years?  Why does she not show an example as a leader or a deputy leader of a country, show the people and give them the hope they need?  They need to know there is some someone at the top who will show the light, show the way and not keep with the same ding-dong with the fat cats of this country.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste should go around Ireland to the small and medium-sized businesses.  She has talked about where we are now.  We are &euro;208 billion in debt.  We are not out of the woods.  The T&aacute;naiste should go into every small town in this country.  Small and medium-sized businesses are struggling and on their knees.  They are keeping the door open and the light lit but I can tell the T&aacute;naiste they will not have a holiday.</p> <p> These people who have absconded and gone include ex-taoisigh and ex-ministers.  Some of them are living outside the State.  They do not give a damn.  They are not worried about small business.  The small businesses are what will bring Ireland back and make an Ireland of the future, not these people who have headed for the hills.</p> <p> I do not accept that we could ask someone if they might give it back to us.  That day is gone.  As legislators, we need to sit down.  Whatever the way, legally it can be done.</p></speech>

Altogether, I think there would be support right around the House.  We could work together and make sure this will not go on.  There are senior civil servants who have retired on massive pensions as well.  This cannot go on, when we see people struggling on &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.  They cannot send their children to college.  They are the people who have pulled Ireland out of the coals, out of the fire.  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to reconsider what she is doing.  We would work with the Government.  I believe everyone in the House is disgusted with what has been said.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that legislation has to come in: if we need to come in during the holidays, let us do it.  Let us go forward, show example and let the people see that there is some decency in politicians before they given up on us once and for all.</p></speech>

We abolished all of the transition payments relating to retiring Ministers.  Not only that, but Ministers and others who would serve henceforth received and took significant cuts in their salaries and in their future pension entitlements.  In fact, for ordinary Deputies the future pension entitlements of those who came to serve recently apply from the age of 65 years.  By the way, at the time, I did not see the Independent Members offering the &euro;41,000 allowance that each of them get on a tax-free basis.</p></speech>

The only way the Government feels it can get it through is by introducing a guillotine.  It is wrong that the Government has broken a promise it made.  For that reason, we oppose the guillotining of this Bill.</p></speech>

In its haste to get these matters through, the Government got the justice committee to sit last Friday, which was most unusual.  It has allowed an hour or an hour and a half to scrutinise legislation that proposes attachment orders, court proceedings and the facility for the State to pickpocket people's wages, social welfare and pensions in respect of utility bills, but particularly in respect of water charges.  That is what this is all about and everybody knows it.  It is part of the last-ditch attempt to enforce a tax and a charge that has been comprehensively discredited and rejected.  The Government's move today, as with last week, to ram it through is despicable and cynical.  It is yet another attempt to frighten into paying what is an unjust and unfair tax those who struggle and for whom the T&aacute;naiste once cared, or so she said.  The cynicism of this, quite apart from the verbal diarrhoea or verbal constipation - one can take one's pick on that score - is stunning.  It is sneaky and bad parliamentary practice, but it is much more than that.  It is recognised outside this Chamber for exactly what it is: yet another episode in the Government's attempt to strong-arm people into coughing up a tax that is unfair, unjust and, for many families, unpayable.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the deputy leader of the Labour Party told the nation on Sean O'Rourke's radio programme that he was beyond satisfied with the payment levels and that there were enforcement mechanisms being considered in the D&aacute;il that would sort it all out.  Now we have found out that after this discussion ends, we will have approximately 20 minutes in which to discuss the legislation.  This is incredible.  In this D&aacute;il session, the pattern has been one of democracy being completely upended and of the Government failing even to bother taking any note of the institutions it set up itself.  Last night, for example, the Seanad overturned the T&aacute;naiste's proposal to the cut lone parents benefits.  What has she to say about that?  She has not opened her mouth about it.  I voted to abolish the Seanad because I believe it is a waste of space and its Members are unelected, but the people spoke.  I have not heard a peep out of the T&aacute;naiste about what happened in the Seanad last night.  We are to finish today at 6.30 p.m. although this issue has not even been addressed.  When are we going to discuss it and the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill?</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste advertised on social media using the phrase "Ask Joan".  However, when anyone ever asks her anything in here, she waffles on and ignores it.  "Ask Joan" is right.  She never answers any questions and makes no time for the key issues.  This will increase the cynicism of people about politics.  The T&aacute;naiste is ignoring the fact that she has no mandate on water charges.  She got her answer yesterday and I predict the rate of non-payment will increase now as others gain confidence.</p>  <p>  On the issue of lone parents, there is lasting bitterness for which the T&aacute;naiste will pay the price.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600025#X00300"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Referendum Act 1994 to provide for a time frame within which the Courts must ordinarily hear and make a finding on a referendum petition and related matters.</blockquote>On 22 May the people of Ireland expressed their democratic will and voted overwhelmingly in favour of marriage equality.  However, it appears that the will of the people may  be subject to indefinite delay as the courts deal with a petition challenging the outcome of the referendum.  While it is the right of a citizen to initiate such a petition, this is not the first time a petition challenging the outcome of a referendum has resulted in a lengthy delay for citizens in being afforded the protection of their newly recognised rights.  The children's rights referendum was passed on 10 November 2012, but the High Court only reached a decision on 24 April this year on the petition lodged, a delay of two and a half years.  A further example is the delay experienced following the divorce referendum when a petition challenging the result caused a delay of six months.  Delays in implementing the democratic will of the people, as expressed in a referendum, are not acceptable.</p><p>The current legislation only stipulates that the courts must deal with petitions as a matter of priority.  This is not adequate, as the courts are not adhering to this provision.  We all know that the system is clogged, but when constitutional rights and newly decided referenda decisions are impacted on, extraordinary measures must be available and priority status accorded.  The Bill seeks to amend the Referendum Act 1994 to provide that the High Court would ordinarily make a finding on such a petition within 90 days of it being heard.  It further seeks to provides that where such a finding is challenged by way of appeal, the Supreme Court would endeavour to make a finding on a petition no later than 90 days from the date on which the appeal was lodged.  This would give the courts a clear timeframe within which to deal with any petition, while retaining the necessary flexibility required by the administration of justice.  </p><p>The intention of the Bill is to send a clear message to citizens, including our friends in the LGBT community, that we have not forgotten about them.  When the people speak, the State must listen.  There is nothing that can trump the democratic will of the people.  The arms of the State must, at all times, protect it above all else.  We cannot allow a situation where legal delays impact on a citizen's hard fought for rights.  That is why we are asking the Government to support the Bill to bring such delays to an end.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.582" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600025#X01000"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for banded hour contracts, the right for a worker to request increased hours and a corresponding obligation on an employer to consider such a request, to permit refusal only on objectively justified grounds and an obligation on employers to provide information to workers on the overall working hours available in the employment.</blockquote>This Bill seeks to provide that a worker or his or her trade union representative, or a representative acting on his or her behalf, is entitled, after six months of continuous employment with his or her employer, to make a request in writing of the employer to be moved to an increased weekly band of hours, as set out in the legislation.  Under the existing legislation, Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, there is no obligation on an employer to consider such a request.</p><p>The Bill provides that the employer must comply or set out that it is not economically feasible.  The employer must demonstrate that the business is experiencing severe financial difficulties such that there would be a substantial risk that the workers would be made redundant if the hours were granted, the sustainability of the business would be adversely affected or the business could not sustain the increased level of hours.  In the event that a worker disagrees with the employer's refusal on the grounds set out in the legislation, the complaints procedure would be through the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Bill also includes an obligation on the employer to inform all employees on the overall availability of working hours by displaying this information in a prominent position in the place of employment.</p> <p> People may ask why this legislation is necessary.  The Mandate trade union has successfully negotiated banded hours contracts with a number of large employers.  These employers have engaged constructively with the State's industrial relations mechanisms.  However, some extremely profitable employers will not do so.  Mandate's "Decency for Dunnes Stores Workers" campaign and the accompanying dispute sets out in stark terms why this legislation is necessary.  As Dunnes Stores and other employers take a very different approach to the rights of their employees, we, as legislators, have an obligation to provide alternative ways to facilitate the relationship between employers and their staff or the trade unions that represent the employees.  We are looking for a level of equilibrium whereby decent employers can function within society and also whereby workers can seek to have their hours increased in a very gentle fashion over time.  Under this legislation it would take about two and a half years for a worker to have his or her working hours increased to the maximum amount.</p> <p> A survey published by the Mandate trade union earlier this year found that three quarters of Dunnes Stores staff were on part-time contracts and yet 98% wanted increased hours.  This is not about flexibility around the edges of a functioning business.  This is a business built on a system of low-hours contracts.  It is simply unjustifiable for employers to keep the bulk of their staff on part-time flexible contracts as it pushes these people into poverty and into a position where they cannot plan for their families.  It creates undue hardship as mothers struggle to deal with child care arrangements and families cannot be sure of what they will earn from one end of the month to the other.</p> <p> Anyone who has run a business will say that the Dunnes Stores model has nothing to do with seasonal staffing needs and everything to do with leverage over employees, in other words being able to say to an employee, "Shape up or we'll cut your hours.  Change your behaviour, attitude and everything about you or we'll change your hours."  It is exploitation, pure and simple.  The model undermines good businesses because it gives a competitive advantage to those who exploit.  Decent terms and conditions result in good business because they create a productive workforce and allow that workforce to spend and engage in the real economy.</p> <p> As legislators, we have a responsibility to the wider economy and of course society to intervene in such practices.  It is beyond time for the Labour Party to take an active role in ensuring that basic employment rights are upheld.  It is important to note that the recently introduced industrial relations legislation merely restates what was there before while offering some level of compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on collective bargaining.  The Labour Party has not championed the rights of workers during its recent term in office.  I hope, as the general election approaches, it might rectify this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600026#Y00900"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Act of 1962 to provide for a verdict of Iatrogenic Suicide and related matters.</blockquote>This Bill is to be known as &quot;Jake's Amendment&quot;.  On 20 March 2013, shortly after being prescribed the antidepressant, Prozac, 14 year old Jake McGill Lynch ended his own life using a firearm.  Jake, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, was given the antidepressant drug despite research stating the drug has no benefit for children with Asperger's syndrome and despite the emerging evidence of harm.</p><p>In the midst of their grief, Jake's parents have come to understand that their personal tragedy is one that has been shared by thousands of families whose loved ones have died as a result of antidepressant-induced suicide.  I welcome Jake's parents, John and Stefani, to the Visitors Gallery today.  They have worked tirelessly to bring attention to this issue and to campaign for a change to the law.  Their request is simple.  They want the Coroners Act to be amended in order that a coroner can return a verdict of iatrogenic - medically induced - suicide where such is the case.  It is an issue that must be highlighted.  A verdict of suicide, returned in accordance with the provisions of the 1962 Act, must be differentiated from a verdict of iatrogenic suicide.  Iatrogenic suicide is the ending of one's own life where the effect of medical treatment undertaken by the deceased, including any prescribed medication, is the primary cause of such an action.</p><p>We understand that the publishing of this Bill is symbolic.  It is obvious that the Coroners Act 1962 is no longer fit for purpose and should be repealed and replaced with an amended version of the Coroners Bill 2007 as a matter of priority.  The amended version of the 2007 Bill should contain a comprehensive list of verdicts open for a coroner or a jury, as the case may be, to return.  When it is finally amended, this list should provide for a verdict of iatrogenic suicide to be made.</p><p>I hope the Government will support this Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill as drafted does not make it sufficiently clear that the costs which relate to an application for an attachment of earnings order or a deduction from payments order can be included in the order the court makes under section 10 or section 16.  The Parliamentary Counsel has examined the text again and has advised that the approach in these amendments is clearer.  Costs are usually claimed in respect of the recovery of debts.  The costs schedules are set out in the rules of court as per normal practice.</p></speech>

We do not think we will get there but that is our reason for objecting.</p>  <p>  I also object to the fact the Bill will be guillotined in a couple of minutes.  All the Opposition amendments were ruled out of order.  We have had no discussion on most of this important legislation which only completed Second Stage last Friday.  This is not the way to do any sort of democratic politics.  It is in line with the incredible Garda presence yesterday for quite a small protest outside Leinster House.  It shows the attempt to just ram things through.  It is a bullying approach that will not work, as illustrated by the figures.  However, it should be registered that none of it has anything in common with the idea of a democratic revolution and respecting democratic rules in this D&aacute;il or outside it.</p></speech>

Section 43 provides for an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act 1976, for the purposes of giving effect to the Labour Court recommendation on the scope of the agriculture JLC, arising from the 2013 review undertaken by the court of all existing joint labour committees.</p>  <p>  In addition, section 46 amends the original establishment order for the agriculture JLC to reflect the new definition in section 43.  However, there is a possibility that the new definition of "agriculture" may inadvertently be construed as including meat processing plants within the scope of the agriculture JLC.  However, it was the clear intention of the Labour Court recommendation that the definition the scope the agriculture JLC and any ERO emerging from that committee would just cover workers on a farming establishment.  Accordingly, an amendment to the definition of "agriculture" in section 43 is necessary to remove any doubt in this regard.  A corresponding amendment to section 46, which itself amends the original establishment order for the agriculture JLC, is also required.</p></speech>

This is one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation we have seen in the House in many a long year.  There is now collective bargaining, whereas in the past a company could have decided not to deal with a trade union.  This issue dates back to 1913, prior to the foundation of the State, when Jim Larkin led the Lockout.  Employers now have to engage with workers.</p>  <p>  It is also extremely important that once again we have registered employment agreements which had been struck down by the Supreme Court.  They affect some of the most vulnerable in society.  This was a major consideration for the trade union movement when negotiating on the issue of Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  Although the Low Pay Commission is not referred to in the Bill, it is very much part of the package.  The legislation has gone through and the first report is due, I believe, in a week's time or thereabouts.  We can now talk about raising the minimum wage and having a living wage.  We can look at matters in that context.  </p>  <p>  This package of proposals is a huge step forward in industrial relations.  It will ensure proper pay and conditions and decent standards of work to a much greater degree than in the past.  I pay full tribute to all those involved in producing the Bill, including the civil servants and the Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and Gerald Nash.  It is welcome that it was prioritised in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

The various avenues for conducting or completing inquiries are also set out.</p><p>In summary, the disciplinary committee will write to the teacher informing him or her of the nature of the complaint, including evidence supporting it, and an opportunity for him or her to request that the matter be investigated by way of an examination of documents.  If a hearing is to be held, the teacher will be informed that he or she, or his or her representative, may be present to defend himself or herself at the hearing and that he or she may request that some or all of the hearing be held in private.  The inquiry will be carried out by a panel of the disciplinary committee, consisting of three to five persons, the majority of whom will be registered teachers.  At the request of the teacher, the panel may agree to hold the inquiry by way of consideration of documents and written submissions only, that is, in place of a hearing.</p><p>Having considered the complaint, the panel may request the teacher to do one or more of the following and before a hearing takes place: to undertake not to repeat the conduct; to undertake to attend a specified professional development course or such other course as the panel considers appropriate; to undertake to comply with such requirements as may be specified for the purposes of improving his or her competence and performance; to consent to seek the assistance of such services relating to health and welfare as may be specified; or to consent to being censured.</p><p>Where a registered teacher gives the type of undertaking I have just outlined, the inquiry will be completed.  However, where a registered teacher does not give an undertaking in these matters, the inquiry will continue as if the request had not been made by the panel.</p><p>A hearing, if required, will be held in public by default, unless the teacher or a witness, about whom personal matters may be disclosed at the inquiry, requests that all or part of the hearing be held in private and the panel is satisfied that it would be appropriate in the circumstances to do so.  At the hearing the director, or any other person with leave of the panel, will present evidence in support of the complaint.  Witnesses will give testimony on oath and there will be the right to cross-examine witnesses and call evidence.  The panel will be able to receive evidence given orally, by affidavit or other means such as video link.  It will have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court in respect of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and their examination on oath or otherwise and can compel the production of documents.  A witness will have the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.</p><p>For the purposes of the inquiry, a panel may, in accordance with the provisions of the new section 43A, consider information in a vetting disclosure and any submission made on that disclosure.  I will outline the provisions of section 43A when dealing with amendment No. 42.</p><p>On completion of an inquiry, the panel may make no finding and dismiss the complaint.  Otherwise, it will produce a report setting out the nature of the complaint, the evidence considered, the measures where a teacher has given an undertaking, where appropriate, and the panel&rsquo;s findings.  In addition, where the complaint relates to the conviction of a teacher for an offence triable on indictment, the panel must report whether the findings affect his or her fitness to teach.  It will also report any other matter it considers appropriate. </p><p>Under the Bill, the Teaching Council may make a complaint under section 42 where it has received a vetting disclosure giving rise to a <i>bona fide</i>concern that a teacher may harm a child or vulnerable person, cause a child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put a child or vulnerable person at risk of harm, attempt to harm a child or vulnerable person, or incite another person to harm a child or vulnerable person.  In such circumstances, where the panel is satisfied that there is a risk, in its report it will specify the nature of the information disclosed in the vetting disclosure, the evidence, its assessment of the risk and its conclusion in respect of that risk.  Where it is not satisfied that there is a risk, it may dismiss the complaint.</p><p>Where a complaint is dismissed, the complainant, the teacher concerned, such other persons as he or she may request and his or her employer will be informed.  At the request of the teacher, the panel will publish a notice to that effect.  </p><p>The amendment involves the deletion of section 17 of the Bill which also provided for amendments to the provisions for an inquiry.  However, amendment No. 41 is more comprehensive than section 17 in the original Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 45 amends section 44 of the Act and provides that it is the panel, rather than the full disciplinary committee, which, having completed its report, will determine what measures, if any, are to be taken to sanction a teacher.  The original Bill provided for the full disciplinary committee to have this function.</p><p>The amendment ensures consistency between sections 43 and 44 and this approach has been taken on foot of legal advice received by the Department.</p> <p> Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment consequent to amendment No. 41, which replaces subsection (43).  Amendments Nos. 46 to 49, inclusive, replace the term "disciplinary committee" with "panel".  The purpose of the amendments is to ensure consistency of language in section 44 of the principal Act, as amended, which provides that it is the panel and not the disciplinary committee which determines what measures, if any, are to be taken to sanction a teacher following the panel's report.</p></speech>

The 2001 Act already provided that panels would conduct inquiries on behalf of the disciplinary committee and the revised wording strengthens references in the Act to the role of the panels.</p>  <p>  Section 28 of the principal Act provides for membership of the disciplinary committee.  Amendment No. 8 removes the provisions in that section that the director will be secretary to the disciplinary committee and that the chairperson of the Teaching Council will be a member and chairperson of the disciplinary committee.  These changes are proposed on foot of legal advice received by the Department on the separation of duties in terms of governance roles and the conduct of disciplinary inquiries.  The legal advice indicates that it is more appropriate that the chair of the council would not be a member of the disciplinary committee.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 8 also proposes that the council selects eight, rather than seven, of its members who are registered teachers elected to the council or nominated by trade unions to make up the disciplinary committee.  The number is being increased to make up for the removal of the chairperson as a member of the committee.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 51 amends section 44(2)(a) of the Bill, as amended in the D&aacute;il, and provides that the disciplinary committee, rather than the director, advises relevant parties of the decision of a disciplinary panel following an inquiry.  This is consistent with the removal of the requirement for the director to act as secretary to the committee.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 16 substitutes the existing section 33 of the 2001 Act, which relates to renewal of registration.  The Bill as initiated made a number of amendments to section 33 of the 2001 Act.  Further amendments to section 33 were made on both D&aacute;il Committee Stage, Seanad Committee Stage and on Seanad Report Stage.  The substituted section 33 incorporates all amendments made to section 33 to date under the Bill.  It sets out the entire provisions of the amended section 33, making it more coherent and easier to follow.</p><p>The Bill as initiated amended section 33 to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for revised text in relation to the powers of the Teaching Council to make regulations for the purpose of renewal of registration and to also make provision for retrospective vetting and re-vetting arrangements for registered teachers in the context of renewal of their registration.</p><p>Further amendments to section 33 were made on D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  These included amendments clarifying the requirements on the council in relation to notifying a teacher in writing where it intends to seek a vetting disclosure for the purposes of his or her renewal of registration, clarifying the requirements in relation to the council making a decision to refuse renewal of registration on foot of its assessment of a vetting disclosure, providing for a certificate of registration to be issued to teachers, and making clear that where registration is renewed subject to conditions, a timeline may be set within which such conditions must be met.</p><p>In addition, on Seanad Committee Stage, amendments were made to section 33 to clarify further the Bill&rsquo;s wording in relation to the requirements on a teacher in relation to complying with a vetting request within the required timeframe.</p><p>Seanad Report Stage amendments, including minor technical and wording changes arising from proofing the Bill, have now also been incorporated in the substituted section 33.  In that regard, on Seanad Report Stage provision has been made that in exceptional circumstances where, notwithstanding that a registered teacher has co-operated with a vetting requirement in the context of the annual renewal of his or her registration, a vetting disclosure has not been received from the vetting bureau prior to the expiry of the teacher's registration, or it has been received but there has been insufficient time for the council to obtain and consider any submissions required in respect of that disclosure, the person shall remain on the register until such time as a decision on that person's renewal is made by the council having regard to the disclosure received and any submissions submitted by the person as appropriate.</p><p>This is subject to the council making a decision in respect of that person's registration within 21 days after the receipt of the disclosure concerned or where the disclosure contains information of relevance to that person's registration, the council having invited submissions from the person within 21 days of receipt of that disclosure and making a decision in respect of that person's registration within 21 days of receipt of such submissions.</p><p>Subsection 15 of the substituted section 33 also now provides that where a person has not complied with a vetting request for renewal of registration purposes, before the council makes a decision in relation to that person&rsquo;s renewal, the teacher will be offered an opportunity to make submissions to the council as to why he or she did not comply and that the council will consider such submissions before making a decision in respect of that person's registration.</p><p>Where the council is not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the person not complying with the vetting request, the council shall refuse to register that person.  The council may, however, renew the person's registration where the teacher has satisfied the council that there were reasonable grounds for not complying with the vetting request, and having considered any further submissions from the teacher.  These provisions ensure a teacher who has a valid and genuine reason for not complying within the required timeframe with a vetting request, perhaps due to incapacity or other exceptional circumstances, is not unfairly removed from the register.</p><p> The substituted section 33 also clarifies that where a teacher appeals the council&rsquo;s decision to the High Court, the teacher will remain on the register during the period of appeal.  The only exception to this will be where the Teaching Council, where it considers it to be in the public interest, has successfully applied to the High Court for an order to suspend the teacher from the register under section 47.  In such cases, the High Court will, where the teacher is employed in a recognised school, determine whether or not the teacher continues to be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p> <p> Section 33, as amended, now provides also that, following a High Court decision on an appeal, a teacher or the Teaching Council can make a furtherappeal to the Court of Appeal on a specified question of law.  In such a case, the relevant court shall also, where the teacher is employed in a recognised school, determine whether the teacher continues to be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Seanad amendment No. 10 updates section 30 of the 2001 Act to cross reference the new subsection 22 of section 33 arising from amendment number 16.  Seanad amendment No. 15 is a consequential amendment to section 9 of the Bill, also arising from amendment No. 16.  Section 9 of the Bill inserted a new section 31A into the principal Act placing a requirement on a person to provide his or her consent to vetting at initial registration or where he or she is requested by the council to do so, for the purposes of renewal of his or her registration.  Under Seanad amendment No. 16, those provisions in respect of a teacher's compliance with a vetting request for renewal of registration purposes are being expanded and incorporated into section 33 and are therefore being removed from section 9.  Seanad amendments Nos. 17, 18, and 20 to 22, inclusive, are also technical amendments necessary to re-number existing references in the Bill to section 33 on foot of amendment No. 16.</p></speech>

That section sets out the grounds on which complaints about registered teachers may be made and the role and processes to be followed by the director and the investigating committee in respect of such complaints.  Subsection (1D) of section 42 as amended by the Bill provides that the council may make a complaint to the investigating committee where a vetting disclosure, obtained in its conduit role for school employers, gives rise to a bona fide child protection concern.  Amendment No. 26 inserts a new subsection (1E) into section 42 which makes clear that the council may also make a complaint to the investigating committee, under the existing provisions of section 42(1)(g), where a disclosure obtained in its conduit role contains information in relation to a criminal conviction.  Under the Bill as it stands, section 42(1)(g) provides that a complaint may be made in respect of a registered teacher on the grounds "that he or she has been convicted in the State of an offence triable on indictment or convicted outside the State of an offence consisting of acts or omissions that, if done or made in the State, would constitute an offence triable on indictment".  Amendment  No. 26 makes clear that such a complaint may be made by the council where a vetting disclosure obtained in its conduit role for school employers contains information about a conviction of this nature.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are technical amendments to revise numbering following inclusion of amendment No. 26.  Amendments Nos. 29, 32 and 37 are also linked to amendment No. 26.  Amendment No. 29 makes clear that where the council, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Bill, makes a complaint in respect of information contained in a vetting disclosure that it has obtained in its conduit role, the council shall provide the director with a copy of the vetting disclosure concerned and shall indicate the information within that disclosure which grounds the complaint.  Amendment No. 31 is a technical amendment creating the link necessary for the provisions of amendment No. 32 to be inserted in the Bill.  Amendment No. 32 makes clear that the director may, in the case of such complaints and for the purpose of considering whether to refuse or to refer such a complaint to the investigating committee, consider the information in the disclosure in so far as it relates to the complaint in question.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 37 replaces subsection (7) of section 43, as amended by this Bill, with revised wording to incorporate additional provisions that set out more comprehensively the requirements on the investigating committee when dealing with such complaints.  This new subsection (7) has been amended to provide that in addition to providing the teacher concerned with a copy of the complaint and other information and documentation accompanying the complaint, the investigating committee shall provide a copy of the vetting disclosure to the teacher concerned where the complaint has been made by the council in relation to information in that disclosure and for the teacher to be invited to make submissions in respect of that vetting disclosure.  This amendment also makes clear that the investigating committee may consider the information in a disclosure insofar as that information relates to the complaint made by the council and any submissions made in relation to that disclosure.</p></speech>

(4) Subject to such rules as may be made under Schedule 3, a panel may, at the request of, or with the consent of, the registered teacher concerned hold an inquiry under this section by an examination of documents and written submissions from the complainant and the registered teacher, including any documents and written submissions considered by the Investigating Committee in relation to the complaint, in place of a hearing.

(c) as otherwise allowed by those rules, including by means of a live video link, a video recording, a sound recording or any other mode of transmission.(14) A panel shall, for the purpose of an inquiry under this section, have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court or a judge thereof in respect of&mdash;(a) the enforcement of the attendance of witnesses and their examination on oath or otherwise, and

(b) the compelling of the production of documents, and a summons signed by the chairperson of the panel or by such other member of the panel as may be authorised by the panel for that purpose may be substituted for and shall be equivalent to any formal procedure capable of being issued in an action for enforcing the attendance of witnesses and compelling the production of documents.(15) For the purposes of an inquiry under this section, a panel may, in relation to a vetting disclosure, consider the information and submissions referred to in section 43A.

(vi) any other matter in relation to the registered teacher which the panel considers appropriate,(c) where it is satisfied, in respect of a complaint made under subsection (1D) of section 42, having regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons, that there is a risk that the teacher may harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm, attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person, make a report of the inquiry and shall specify in the report&mdash;(i) the nature of the information disclosed in the vetting disclosure giving rise to the complaint under that subsection,

(ii) the evidence laid before the panel,

(iii) its assessment of the risk concerned, and

(iv) its conclusion in respect of that risk,

or(d) where it is not satisfied, in respect of a complaint made under subsection (1D) of section 42, having regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons, that there is a risk that the teacher may harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm, attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person, dismiss the complaint.(18) Where the panel dismisses a complaint under subsection (17), the panel shall, as soon as practicable, by notice in writing, inform&mdash;(a) the complainant,

&ldquo;Use of information in vetting disclosures in inquiry under section 43

43A.

(b) submissions (if any) made by the registered teacher concerned under subsection (7A)(b) of section 42 to the Investigating Committee.(2) Where the Investigating Committee did not seek a vetting disclosure in respect of a registered teacher under section 42(7A) in relation to a complaint and a panel considers that the complaint referred to the Disciplinary Committee by the Investigating Committee under section 42(9)(a) is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a bona fide concern that that teacher may&mdash;(a) harm any child or vulnerable person,

(b) cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed,

(c) put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm,

(d) attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or

(e) incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person,

the panel may request the Council to apply to the National Vetting Bureau for a vetting disclosure in respect of that registered teacher.(3) Where a panel receives a vetting disclosure under subsection (2) in respect of a registered teacher, it shall provide the registered teacher concerned with a copy of the disclosure and invite that teacher to make submissions in writing to the panel in relation to the disclosure within such time period as is specified in the notice.

(4) A panel shall consider submissions (if any) made by the registered teacher concerned under subsection (3).

(5) Subject to subsection (6), a panel may, for the purpose of its inquiry, consider the information contained in a vetting disclosure obtained under subsection (2) in so far as the information relates to the conduct which is the subject of the complaint.

(6) Where a vetting disclosure obtained by the Council under subsection (2) in respect of a registered teacher contains specified information and that specified information relates to conduct of the teacher which occurred prior to the coming into operation of section 16 of the Act of 2015, the panel may not consider that information for the purposes of subsection (5) unless the conduct concerned would have constituted a criminal offence at the time the conduct occurred.

(7) For the purposes of an inquiry under section 43 in relation to a complaint made under subsection (1D) of section 42, a panel may consider&mdash;(a) the information contained in a vetting disclosure referred to in that subsection in so far as the information grounds the complaint under, and in accordance with, that subsection, and

(b) submissions (if any) made by the registered teacher concerned under subsection (7)(a)(ii) of section 42 in so far as the submissions relate to that vetting disclosure.(8) For the purposes of an inquiry under section 43 in relation to a complaint made under subsection (1)(g) to which subsection (1E) applies, a panel may consider&mdash;(a) the information contained in a vetting disclosure referred to in subsection (1E) in so far as the information grounds the complaint under subsection (1)(g), and

In addition, it is an offence if a person does anything which, if the panel were a court of law, would be contempt of court.  The amendment provides that a person who commits an offence will be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine.  These matters were already included as offences in the 2001 Act, but references need to be updated to reflect that it is the panel which is conducting the inquiry and making decisions.  The inclusion of the words "a class C fine" in place of a fine of "&pound;1,905" updates the provision in accordance with the more current legislative approach.</p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides an excellent policing service for the people.  As a society, we look to it to create and maintain an environment in which we can go about our daily lives free from threats of criminality.  Where such criminality arises, we look to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.  To this end, the Garda has been given certain powers.  These must be exercised in a lawful and proportionate manner.  Where there is a question about whether it has used those powers properly, it must be held to account.  This is a fundamental principle of the exercise of any power, namely, accountability.</p><p>It is vital we fully address any allegation of Garda misconduct or wrongdoing in the interests of maintaining public confidence in the Garda and protecting the professional standards of the overwhelming majority of dedicated and conscientious members of the force.  To ensure the public can have full confidence in the Garda, a system of oversight is provided by GSOC.  This commission is a vital part of our policing infrastructure.  It was set up under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide an independent system for receiving complaints and dealing with allegations of Garda misconduct.  Its purpose is to promote public confidence in the process for resolving these complaints or allegations.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that I recently laid the 2014 annual report of GSOC before the Houses.  It was a challenging year for GSOC and the subject of a great deal of political and media commentary and some controversy.  Notwithstanding that, the year was a busy one for GSOC.  It received 11% more complaints and concluded 8% more cases than in 2013.  The report stated there was a marked improvement in efficiency and in dialogue and co-operation with the Garda.  This suggests the protocols that were put in place in 2013 have been helpful in terms of the working relationship between GSOC and the Garda Commissioner and Garda.</p><p>Reform in the criminal justice area is a priority for the Government.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015 has expanded the remit and powers of GSOC, including by bringing the Garda Commissioner within the scope of its investigative powers.  The Act also expanded the time within which persons can bring complaints to the commission.  Further changes are contained in the Bill to establish the policing authority, which has passed all Stages in the Seanad and will be before the D&aacute;il as soon as I can get some time in the House.</p><p>Turning to the Government's nominee for chairperson of GSOC, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring was appointed a judge of the High Court by the President on 9 July 2015.  Her swearing-in ceremony before the Supreme Court took place on 13 July.  Ms Justice Ring's extensive experience as a practising barrister and a judge of the Circuit Court make her well qualified for the position of chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  She has also served in positions on the National Crime Council, was chair of the Irish Women Lawyers Association, IWLA, and has been a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  Ms Justice Ring will work alongside the other members of the ombudsman commission, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Kieran Fitzgerald, and GSOC's professional and administrative staff.  The combination of skills and experience the three commissioners have will ensure strong and effective leadership within GSOC and Ms Justice Ring will make an excellent chairperson.</p><p>I thank the committee for its work yesterday on this matter.  I explained to it that Ms Justice Ring would serve out the remainder of Mr. Simon O'Brien's term until December of next year, at which point the position will be advertised again.  Of course, she would be eligible.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

One of our recommendations was to replace the current three-person commission with one ombudsman, as is the case in the North and other jurisdictions.  We need to move to such a structure where the buck would stop with one person.</p>  <p>  In a number of controversies in recent years, there was speculation about how the system of three people making a collective decision worked.  Consider the various ombudsmen we have, from the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, to the sectoral ombudsmen.  Each comprises just one person and the buck stops with him or her, although each has senior advisers.  I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted this model.  I have no issue with the ability of Ms Justice Ring.  I am sure she will make an excellent chairperson.  My issue is that I would like one person to be the ombudsman and to speak on behalf of that organisation.</p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is the powers given to the ombudsman.  The House saw some amendments to the legislation earlier this year that strengthened the ombudsman's powers, but I would like to see them strengthened further.  Something about which I am concerned and which I will revisit when we deal with the Garda authority legislation is the matter of the independent adjudicator.</p><p>The Minister will recall that Conor Brady, formerly GSOC member, at a conference organised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Law Society of Ireland, suggested that where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could not give information to the Ombudsman - soon to be the Garda authority - for security reasons, there be an independent adjudicator, a member of the Judiciary rather than the Minister, to decide if the grounds for withholding information are legitimate.  Perhaps we might revisit this through the Garda authority legislation as it makes its way through the Houses.</p> <p> Resources for GSOC will be critical.  It has been tasked with looking at the area of penalty points and will have more and more responsibilities.  There are over 300 cases alleging Garda malpractice and I imagine more work will fall on GSOC.  One of the concerns the public has is the length of time GSOC can take to carry out investigations, which impacts on its credibility and the confidence of the public.  It needs the requisite resources and the Minister should engage with the commissioners around this issue to make sure they have the resources required to deliver investigations within a reasonable period of time.  </p> <p> I ask the Minister to look again at the need for just one Garda ombudsman, similar to the ombudsman for every other sector on these islands.  In line with the all-party recommendation of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I also ask her to look at the issue of resourcing GSOC adequately and to look at the issue of security.  She should put in place an independent adjudicator to make it clear to the public that full accountability and oversight exist as required across the whole spectrum.</p></speech>

I will speak for four minutes and Deputy Mick Wallace for one.  </p>  <p>  I am very glad that the appointment to GSOC has finally been made and that we are not going into the recess without it.  The gap has been far too long between the retirement of Mr. Simon O'Brien and this appointment and I feel the commissioners have suffered in his absence.  The time when he was at the helm of the GSOC was one of the most innovative times for putting that organisation on the map.  I do not know much about Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring apart from what is in the public domain.  It might be viewed as an unusual choice because she has a high profile but she is renowned for her independence, an incredibly important asset in this cesspit - I could say "challenge" to be more polite.  Independence is what is required and I understand from people who know her that she is very able, an independent thinker and more likely to be a watchdog than a lapdog.  That is what we need inside this organisation so I wish her well in her new post.  In some ways I feel a little bit sorry for her for what she is getting into, as I do for the other commissioners, because I believe GSOC is at a crisis point.  It has not been armed with the legislative powers to do the necessary job of exercising oversight over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Ms Justice Ring will benefit from her expertise on both sides of the criminal justice system as she will not need to be educated on what can happen when garda&iacute; take a stance or as to the ways in which garda&iacute; sometimes operate.  She is, however, heading up an organisation which is suffering from a lack of resources and power, particularly given the fact that this organisation has also been charged with the function of confidential recipient and is the receiver of complaints about the garda&iacute;, not just from the public but from garda&iacute; themselves about other garda&iacute;.  The recently published annual report shows that only four garda&iacute; have gone to GSOC and it has been very tardy in its approach to dealing with those people.  This is very regrettable and Ms Justice Ring's first job should be to give her backing and support to those garda&iacute; who have the courage to blow the whistle on the inside.</p>  <p>  Looking at the figures in the GSOC annual report, of all the initial contacts with GSOC, only 28% actually became complaints at the end of the day.  GSOC states that in 2014 there was only one case out of thousands in respect of which a criminal investigation was concluded and referred to the Director for Public Prosecutions and where the Director for Public Prosecutions recommended a prosecution.  This could not possibly be the case and we have a huge problem with these statistics.  They show that only 26 files were sent to the Director for Public Prosecutions, while the overwhelming majority of the cases that end up in GSOC are referred back to the garda&iacute; for examination, rather than be independently evaluated by GSOC.  These issues will come back to haunt us.  We are on the record stressing the necessity to strengthen the legislative powers of GSOC but the new commissioner is going to have to bat hard on those things because she has an uphill battle.  I wish her well and if there is anything we can do to assist we will be happy to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.785" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600034#GG00300"><p>I, too, welcome the appointment of the new commissioner.  If she carries her independent streak to the new job it will certainly be beneficial.  Like Deputy Clare Daly, I am worried about the potential of GSOC to hold garda&iacute; to account and we have not been impressed with the changes made.  The body struggles with the task, not necessarily through any fault of its own but because there does not seem to be a massive appetite for serious oversight in the form of a monitoring body with an investigative remit.  This is very much required and it would make a significant difference.</p>  <p>  I am not sure that bringing the confidential recipient element into GSOC will work despite the fact that the Minister is giving an extra &euro;1 million to make it happen.  Many garda&iacute; who have a serious complaint are reluctant to go there and I do not believe GSOC has the wherewithal to deal with it or has been given the necessary resources.  The Minister's task is a difficult one as the Department of Justice and Equality is a very powerful, conservative body and I am sure it is not easy to change its stripes.  Given everything that has been said and done in the past couple of years, people now expect change and there is an appetite among the public for something different from the police force.  A strong, resourceful and fearless GSOC is crucial if we are to have a Garda force that is accountable to the people whom it is supposed to serve and that governs with the consent of the people rather than just as a police force that implements the rule of law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-16a.792" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015071600035#HH00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, I am pleased to introduce to the House the Harbours Bill 2015.  The Bill results from the review of ports policy which began in 2010 and culminated in the publication of a new national ports policy in 2013.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legal basis to allow for the later transfer by ministerial order of the five designated ports of regional significance to local authority-led governance structures.  Every Deputy is aware of just how important our ports are to our island nation.  The Competition Authority estimates that ports handle around 84% of all our merchandise trade in volume and about 62% in terms of value.  The ports are, simply, critical to our ability to trade with the rest of the world.</p><p>Our ports face challenges to ensure they are capable of meeting the modern needs of the economy and the nation.  These challenges are nothing new as throughout history the fortunes of individual ports have ebbed and flowed in response to changes within ports and the shipping industry.  Currently, there are nine State commercial port companies operating under the Harbours Act 1996.  Their status is that of a State-owned private company the shareholders of which are the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The companies are guided by a board of directors appointed by the ministerial shareholders and managed by a chief executive officer answerable to the board of the company.  Additionally, we also have Rosslare Europort which differs from the other ports as it does not operate under the Harbours Acts but is instead a business unit of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Within the nine State port companies there is enormous variety.  As an example, in 2014, Dublin Port handled 21 million tonnes and 7,000 vessels, while at the other end of the scale Wicklow Port handled 94,000 tonnes and 56 vessels.  It is clear that different ports perform different functions and service different markets.  National ports policy recognised these differences through providing a clear outline of the Government's strategic vision for the sector by categorising it in three tiers.</p><p>The tier 1 ports of national significance are Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  Collectively, these three ports handle over 80% of all tonnage handled in Irish ports in any given year.  All three have ambitious development master plans and earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, launched the first phase of the Shannon Foynes development, its east jetty project, while both Cork and Dublin ports have just recently received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for their projects in Ringaskiddy and the Alexandra Basin.  The expected total outlay on all these projects is over &euro;350 million and all will be delivered without any Exchequer contribution.  The Minister was delighted to learn recently that all of the projects had qualified for EU funding through the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, programme and its related Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, funding stream.</p><p>The tier 2 ports of national significance are Rosslare Europort and Waterford Port.  These ports together handle approximately 7% of total tonnage.  Importantly, both offer competition to the bigger ports in the economically significant unitised LoLo and RoRo trades.  Both are well positioned in terms of their ability to service direct routes to the Continent and are well connected to the national rail and road networks.</p><p>The ports of regional significance are the remaining five State port companies.  They are Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow ports and any other port which handles commercial freight.  These are the ports which are central to the Bill.  Collectively, they handle approximately 4.5% of total tonnage, which represents a decrease of over 30% in their collective market share when compared to 2000.  Within them there are individual, very different stories, with some quite dramatic decreases in commercial tonnage in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross and Wicklow, with much more modest decreases or even steady State developments in Galway and Drogheda.  The Government recognises that there are those with particular interests who may question the need to make any change to the <i>status quo.  </i>However, at a national strategic level, we need to be clear on which ports are fundamentally important for national competitiveness and regionally significant.</p><p>The approach adopted by the Government is broadly accepted by all as common sense.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, in its review of the Bill, stated its overall purpose was broadly supported by the committee.  In respect of the ports of regional significance, national ports policy recognises that the five ports continue to play an important role for their regional hinterland.  However, this role is not one that requires central government oversight.</p><p>In line with the Government's reforms in the area of local government generally, responsibility for the oversight of these regionally significant ports should be devolved to the most appropriate level of government, that is, the local authorities.  This devolution of responsibility will allow the ports to continue to develop as required by their regional economy and in tandem with their regional community.  The change in perspective will enrich and enhance their future development.  It better aligns the needs of the local authority, the regional economy and the port.  For some of the ports, the requirement that a separate statutory company should oversee and manage the port may no longer be appropriate.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has funding available for local authorities for a due diligence exercise in respect of all five companies.  The results of these exercises will inform the eventual model of transfer chosen for each port.  The Bill is flexible enough to allow for either the continuation of the existing company and a transfer of the ministerial shareholding to the local authority or for dissolution of the existing company and a physical transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees to the local authority.</p> <p> The main provisions are found in Parts 2, 3 and 5 of the Bill.  Part 2 deals with the first of the two possible transfer methods, that is, a transfer of shareholding in the existing company.  Section 8 provides the actual power to transfer the shareholding to a port company.  Any order under the section will be made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the other current shareholder, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p> Section 9 provides a potentially interesting new dynamic for the commercial ports sector.  It allows for the local authority chief executive, subject to the consent of the elected members of the council and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to consider a divestment of shares in a transferred port company to the private sector.  However, it ensures continued public ownership of the port through limiting any such disposal to 49% only of the shares in the company.  This represents a new potential method of sourcing funds for future development for the transferred port companies.  It is not currently a feature of the sector.</p> <p> Section 10 provides for a general ministerial power of direction to the transferred port companies in respect of the national ports policy.  The section requires the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to consult the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the chief executive of the local authority concerned prior to issuing any such direction.  The requirement for consultation addresses a concern identified by the Oireachtas joint committee with regard to its potential unilateral use and possible interference in a particular company's operations.  The section restricts the use of the direction to general policy issues only; it cannot be used to direct a company to act in a particular manner in a particular instance.</p> <p> Sections 11 to 27, inclusive, lay out the administration of the transferred companies under the new local authority shareholding arrangements.  The Harbours Act will continue to apply to any company that transfers under the transfer of shareholding model.  However, as the Acts contain several explicit provisions relating to the ministerial shareholding, the sections require amendment to reflect the fact that the shareholding has transferred.  The exercise of these shareholder functions will primarily be a matter for the local authority chief executive, but the Bill also provides for a number of important oversight functions for the elected members.</p> <p> Section 11 lists 17 sections of the Harbours Acts that will no longer apply to a transferred company.  These sections are those requiring an active role for the shareholders in consenting to something.  Obviously, since the shareholding has changed, these sections can no longer apply and amended versions are instead included within sections 13 to 27, inclusive.  Many of these sections are routine in nature such as section 14 which requires any change to a transferred company's memorandum and articles of association be approved by the relevant local authority chief executive.  Therefore, I will focus my remarks instead on a number of the more substantive sections, as well as on the role of elected members generally in the oversight of the transferred companies.  </p> <p> In instances where the transfer of shareholding model is chosen as the transfer method, the company structure remains in place as it applies today.  One important consideration in the model is to ensure the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom of the company and democratic oversight.  The Bill achieves this balance through providing for a number of specific oversight functions for elected members of the council.  First, section 23 requires the chairperson and the chief executive of a transferred company to appear before the elected council, if invited, to account for the administration of that company.  Second, there is a provision within section 22 for any proposed chairperson of a transferred company to appear before the elected members prior to formal appointment.  This mirrors the current practice of prospective chairpersons appearing before the Oireachtas joint committee, a practice which the Government introduced and which has proved its worth in allowing elected representatives to quiz prospective chairpersons on their vision and ambition for the company in question.</p> <p> Section 19 requires the annual audited accounts of the transferred company, accompanied by a report on the year generally, to be laid before the elected members.  While it is a matter for the relevant local authority, there are obvious potential links between the submission of the accounts and the power of elected members to require a chairperson and the chief executive to appear before the council under section 23.  I have already stated the consent of the elected council will also be required where any disposal of shares in the transferred company to the private sector is envisaged.</p> <p> In the case of board appointments to the transferred companies, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is clear in his view that the improvements to the board appointments process generally must apply to any transferred company also.  Therefore, section 22 mirrors the improvements introduced in section 39 for those companies remaining under ministerial shareholding.  Directors will be selected through the State board appointments process which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform launched in February.  The Bill requires that certain skill sets be present on the board, including maritime transport, financial, legal and commercial skills.  It also indicates a further set of skill sets that might be considered for board level representation such as infrastructure planning or environmental management.</p> <p> The local authority chief executive will formally appoint the persons recommended by the Public Appointments Service.  The maximum length of total service of any director will be limited to ten years.  This will allow for the development of board level experience, as well as provide the required fresh thinking, which is a necessary feature of any board.  The central oversight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of board fees will be maintained.  As is the case today, the chief executive of a transferred company will be appointed by the board of the particular company after consultation with the local authority chief executive.  The central oversight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of terms and conditions of chief executives will be maintained.</p> <p> These are the key issues addressed in Part 2, but the Bill also provides for a second transfer method within Part 3.  This model is called "transfer and dissolution of companies" and outlined in sections 28 to 33, inclusive.  Essentially, the sections are based on existing precedents generally and provide for the break-up of the company as a corporate body and its complete integration within normal local authority structures.  The port would be administered as any other functional area of a local authority.  All employees would transfer to the service of the local authority, as would all property, assets and liabilities of the company.  The Bill provides for the continuation of harbour and pilotage limits.</p> <p>  Part 5 runs from section 37 to section 49 and generally comprises technical amendments to the existing Harbours Acts that are being made on foot of submissions made during consultation or experience gained in the years since the last amendments were made.  There are, however, three important elements of this Part of the Bill that further improve the overall corporate governance culture within the ports sector.  Section 39 amends the board appointments process through, for example, introducing mandatory skill sets and introducing an overall term limit of ten years.</p> <p> Section 40 introduces a new statutory provision regarding the accountability of a chairperson and the CEO of a port company to elected representatives.  The section requires the chairperson and the CEO to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee if invited to do so and account for the administration of the port company.</p> <p> Section 42 extends the current prohibition on Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs serving on the boards of port companies to include councillors.  This will apply equally to those companies the shareholding of which remains with the Minister and the shareholding of which transfers to a local authority shareholding model.  National ports policy is clear that the boards of port companies must comprise individuals with the necessary skills required in any commercial company.  The Bill is legislating for that very fact in sections 22 and 39.  There have been instances where councillors serving on port company boards have had to absent themselves from discussions at board meetings and also from council discussions on topics owing to potential conflicts of interest.  When people elect their local representative, they obviously do not want to see his or her contribution to local democracy restricted in such a manner.</p> <p> As Deputies can see, the Bill is an important step in the development of the commercial ports sector and an important contribution to the further devolution of responsibility from central to local government.  The changes it introduces will enhance the ports' role as centres of their regional economies, deepen the economic development role envisaged for local authorities and improve the corporate governance and democratic accountability of the sector overall.  The ports sector is an unsung hero of the economy.  Without it, we simply could not trade with the world and many of the everyday items we take for granted would not be available.  The amendments the Bill proposes on board structures will enhance the corporate performance of ports and ensure they will continue to fulfil their vital role as facilitators of the economy.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this important Bill and sector.  We hope the objectives of the Bill will enjoy the support of the House, just as the Bill enjoyed the broad support of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications during its scrutiny.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
