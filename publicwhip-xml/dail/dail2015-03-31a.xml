The draft RDP was formally submitted to the European Commission on 3 July 2014, a number of weeks in advance of the regulatory deadline.  The Commission's formal response to the draft RDP containing a total of 266 observations was received on 20 October 2014.  Since that time, detailed and intensive negotiations have been ongoing between my Department and the Commission to secure agreement on the new RDP.  These bilateral negotiations have recently concluded and Ireland's draft RDP has now been formally resubmitted to the European Commission where it has entered the Commission's final round of inter-services consultation.</p><p> While the formal approval process for the RDP has still to be completed, I am aware of the importance of the roll-out of RDP schemes.  Accordingly, officials from my Department sought at an early stage to establish a very clear understanding with the European Commission as to the shape of the new GLAS, its priorities, the actions that should be applied and the rates of payment.  Having reached this level of agreement, as an interim measure and to allow maximum time for farmers to prepare their GLAS plans, I launched GLAS on 23 February.  Commissioner Hogan has recently announced that the Commission will issue letters of comfort to member states as RDPs complete the bilateral negotiation process, but formal adoption of the RDP will be delayed by amendments to the multi-annual financial framework.  This letter of comfort will ensure that the launch of RDP schemes will not be held up by the formal approval process at EU level and will facilitate the earlier implementation of RDP schemes and supports.</p> <p> When the Commission&rsquo;s final round of inter-services consultation is complete and the letter of comfort has issued, the schemes and supports contained in Ireland&rsquo;s RDP will be rolled out in line with the annual budgetary process.  I expect to receive our letter of comfort within the next two weeks.</p></speech>

In other words, does it provide legal cover against eventualities?  Based on the figures the Minister sent me last week, can he confirm that taking into account inflation, which is real for farmers in terms of the continued increase in prices, the RDP 2014-2020 is 20% less than the real value of the RDP 2007-2013?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100004#B00300"><p>First, the letter of comfort is a practical measure that will enable me to approach the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to have schemes opened and to commit to payment of moneys in that regard.  It is not ideal but it is a solution that allows us to get schemes open, which is what farmers want.  While I would rather that at this stage we had a full approval process for our RDP, the Commission, the Government and the Department are satisfied that a letter of comfort will provide the necessary level of financial and legal cover that we need to be able to get schemes open.</p>  <p>  Second, the Deputy will be aware that payments under Pillar I and the budget for the CAP have been maintained at more or less the same level as previously but they are not index linked.  In other words, they will not increase every year with inflation.  From a lobbying point of view, during the process of agreement of the rural development programme and Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, farmers were clear that what they wanted was no less in actual terms than they got the last time.  That is what was achieved.</p></speech>

No account is taken of inflation.  Inflation is real yet farmers are being paid the same amount now as they were being paid seven years ago.  This is the same as the Government proposing next that workers be paid 1950 wages and saying that they are being given the same amount of cash as they were given in 1950, which is quite farcical.  Can the Minister confirm that the figures he provided to me last week are correct?  Can he further confirm that he sought advice from the Attorney General as to the legal status of the letter of comfort, and when the genomics, TAMS, organic and knowledge transfer and animal welfare schemes will open?</p></speech>

It is likely the schemes will open one after the other in May and June.  We cannot open them all at the same time for good practical reasons.  However, there will be a roll out of schemes one after the other, and TAMS and the genomics scheme will both be prioritised.  However, there will also be support for the islands, which I hope the Deputy will welcome, and increases in the organic scheme.  There are many other schemes to be rolled out over the summer.</p></speech>

Irish dairy production, with Austria, has the lowest carbon-intensity in the EU as per the European Commission Joint Research Centre findings.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with our EU commitments is understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015.  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision in the first half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020, which will have to be addressed in the national mitigation plan, currently being prepared. </p>  <p>  The approach in the current Effort Sharing Decision, in terms of greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2020, treats emissions from agriculture in essentially the same way as emissions from sectors such as transport and does not take into account the limited cost-effective mitigation options available in the sector. </p>  <p>  While the 2020 targets remain binding, Ireland has engaged in intensive discussions with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and the greatly increased global demand for food with EU climate-change ambition.  An important step forward in developing a coherent policy on food security and climate change was taken at the October 2014 European Council. </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and other Departments are continuing to work together to ensure a whole of Government approach to building upon this and working with the Commission to ensure that EU climate and food policies to 2030 and beyond recognise the reality of these global challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100005#C02000"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure the Minister read the article in the farming section of today's Irish Independent.  An Taisce claims that with a 20% target for reduction in emissions from 2005 to 2020, only 2% has been achieved so far, meaning that 18% is still outstanding.  It quotes the Minister, as saying there will be a bigger burden on other sectors in order to meet that reduction target.  I ask the Minister to enlighten us in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100005#C02100"><p>That is a very fair question.  Applying a 20% reduction target does not mean that we apply 20% reduction across each sector.</p><p>Some sectors have more capacity than others to reduce emissions.  It is true that other sectors will have to do more than 20%, because I believe agriculture does not have the capacity to achieve those numbers.</p> <p> That said, agriculture will play its part, and I am determined that it will.  It is already playing its part, but the targets I am setting for agriculture are related to the emissions intensity of what we do.  If Ireland is producing milk at the lowest carbon footprint in the world relative to other countries, does it make sense, in terms of a global climate change challenge, for the country that is doing the best job in producing milk at a low emissions intensity to reduce its herd size and produce less to allow other countries, that are producing at a higher emissions intensity, to produce more?  The markets are going to demand more anyway.  The point we have been making at European level, both throughout the CAP process and since then, is that we must combine the joint challenges of a responsible approach towards climate change in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change challenges while at the same time responding to global food security issues.</p> <p> I hope Ireland will set the global benchmark for how to produce food at a low emissions intensity.  We will use science, innovation, breeding and grazing programmes, feed conversion efficiency management and all the other elements we are applying on Irish farms.  In addition, we will audit and measure the performance on our farms.  Every farming organisation in the country has signed up to all dairy farms in the country having a sustainability audit system on farms.  Currently, we are measuring the greenhouse gas emissions from the herds on 48,000 beef farms.  Ireland is the only country in the world doing this.  Anyone who suggests that I, the Government and Ireland are not taking emissions from the agricultural sector seriously does not understand what we are doing.  What I will not do is reduce herd size, when we have a good emissions record, to facilitate blunt targets that only apply to Ireland.</p></speech>

There are organisations that will try to run an agenda, through scaremongering tactics and otherwise, in respect of preventing the potential that can be realised as a result of the abolition of the quota.  There is a similar question from Deputy Fitzmaurice but it relates to the beef sector.</p></speech>

There is a need for a real debate on the sustainability story of Irish food production.  We are exporting nearly 90% of everything we produce and we plan to grow that, so we must be able to prove to our critics, competitors and the clients to whom we sell that this is a story of growth that is also focusing on sustainability.  We have a great story to tell in this regard, which is improving year on year.</p>  <p>  I have much admiration for organisations such as An Taisce.  They are right to raise issues about the climate change challenge we face, along with other environmental challenges relating to water management, protecting biodiversity, protecting special areas of conservation and so forth.  However, the idea that one would reduce output to meet national targets when, in fact, one's output is a really good performer in international terms and in terms of the emissions intensity of one's production systems does not make sense.  I will not restrict farmers from growing and expanding their businesses if they are doing a good job from a sustainability point of view, and we must win the argument at European level on that basis.</p></speech>

Accusations have been made around the lack of priority for the sustainability story of Irish food production and that there is a sole focus on output, growth, expansion and so on.  Those accusations do not recognise the extraordinary work that Ireland has undertaken in the past three or four years on the sustainability agenda, including auditing sustainability on farms, processing facilities and so on.  The Origin Green programme is what makes the Irish food production system different from most of our competitors.  By the end of next year we hope that all food and drink exported from Ireland will be from companies and farmers, who are responsible for the primary production of that food, that have signed up to the Origin Green programme - in other words, that have invited audits in respect of the sustainability of how they produce that food.  That is the approach we are taking.</p>  <p>  We are going to be setting up a dairy forum.  Sustainability will be a big part of that discussion, as will the financial management of growth and the technology and innovation that can help us get better results in a more sustainable way than in the past.</p>  <p>  Any old fool can reduce emissions by simply reducing production.  There is no challenge in that.  The challenge for the globe and for Ireland, in terms of giving leadership in this area, is finding a way to produce more food while reducing the overall emissions footprint of our production systems.  It has to be all about the emissions intensity of a litre of milk or a kilo of beef.  Ireland has to find ways of doing that and we are investing heavily in this area.  This is why we have the new beef genomics scheme, for example.  The idea is that we can breed better animals which grow faster and are slaughtered earlier.  As a result, emissions during their lifetime are lower because they are killed at 20 or 22 months rather than 30 or 32 months.  That is the approach that I have taken from a sustainability point of view.  Essentially, An Taisce seems to be suggesting that the way in which agriculture must play its part in terms of the global climate change challenge is by simply reducing our herd size.  That is not a sustainable approach towards a global problem.</p></speech>

Anyhow, I believe we need to focus on what we are good at as a nation, which is agriculture.</p>  <p>  The Minister should check on the matter, but some of the larger countries in Europe have already put their hands up and said they will not achieve what they are supposed to achieve by 2020.  If we are going to have that difficulty then let us be up front with it.  Let us say it out.  Let the different countries get together in Europe.  There is no point in our trying to hide something.  At the end of the day, we have come through a serious recession.  We need people in jobs.  If the dairy industry is going to produce what the Minister is saying, then it is great for jobs.  It is going to help people in all parts of Ireland.  I do not think anyone with a little common sense would try to prevent jobs by referring to these emissions.</p>  <p>  Other countries have a good deal of industry, and this leaves the emissions from their agriculture sectors looking lower.  We have a large agriculture sector.  That is why our emissions look higher.  Many mitigating factors are not taken into account in the agricultural sector, and this needs to be brought across.  We need to go out to those in Europe and we need to go ahead and keep people in jobs regardless of what they say.</p></speech>

Between 3,000 and 4,000 extra people could be actually milking cows, but there will also be more employment in processing, transport and refrigeration, export and packaging, food science and nutrition and all the other things that the dairy industry is now about.</p><p>That is a hugely positive thing for rural Ireland.  If anyone drives out of Cork city and through Mallow, they will see an &euro;80 million investment by Dairygold.  If they drive across to Mitchelstown, there is a &euro;40 million investment there.  If they drive to Charleville, there is another &euro;50 million investment, this time by the Kerry Group.  If they drive across to Moorepark in Fermoy, there is another investment of approximately &euro;30 million for research facilities.  This is what the dairy industry is doing for Ireland, and that is just in rural Cork, so that picture can be replicated in other counties as well.</p> <p> I am certainly not going to allow a situation where, because of the setting of blunt targets for agriculture or for Ireland as a whole, we are going to reduce herd size and reduce output to meet targets when we are producing milk at the lowest emissions intensity on the planet.  We are making, and we will make, that argument at a European level in terms of the setting of targets for 2030.  However, that is not to say that Ireland does not need to do radical and dramatic things to meet our targets in terms of our responsibilities regarding climate change.  We need to look at what we can do in other sectors.  While the emissions from agriculture have come down considerably over the past ten years, there is a lot we can do in regard to energy and transport in particular, and we need to be very ambitious in those areas.</p></speech>

Whatever Europe says, if we can show that we are doing something in the most efficient way in Europe, whoever has to take the hit in other parts of Europe or the world, they should take it, provided we are the ringleader in all of this.  I believe we can produce milk and beef more efficiently than anywhere else.</p></speech>

However, that does not mean agriculture does not need to pull its weight.  We need to get better, year on year, every year, in terms of the emissions intensity of our production systems.  That is why we are measuring and auditing, and we will be widening those audits to include water, more efficient feeding systems, better grazing programmes, better breeding programmes and so on.  The more sustainable we are generally in terms of the emissions intensity of our production systems, the more profitable we are too, and there is a direct correlation between efficiency and profitability on beef farms, dairy farms, poultry units, pig units, sheep farms and so on.</p>  <p>  We are moving agriculture into a space that is prioritising sustainability.  However, we cannot allow people to make the case that there is an easy answer to all of this, which is to simply reduce our herd size.  The detrimental impact that would have on rural society is something I will not tolerate.  Instead, we will solve this problem through innovation and through better ways of doing things, which is what I believe we have a responsibility to give leadership on.</p></speech>

Apparently, the way he agreed to the scheme being written did not allow country discretion to allow these farmers to benefit from the schemes.  In other words, the Minister did not allow himself the discretion to deal with the so-called "old young farmers" who have been so badly discriminated against by him.  Is he going to take steps to deal with this matter?</p></reply>

To explain how things happened as they did, Ireland was one of the leading countries, if not the leading country, looking to insist that every country would be required to prioritise young farmers, and we got our way on that in the end.  However, the Commission insisted, and agreed with us, that as part of that, if a country has a mandatory measure, then it has to define what a young farmer is in the regulation, which is what happened.  Therefore, a young farmer was defined as a person under the age of 40 who has come into farming in the last five years, because the whole point of positively discriminating in favour of these people is to give them a bit of extra cash and financial support to get them started in agriculture as young farmers who have come into farming in recent times.</p><p>That was its purpose.  This group of people is now getting priority treatment in Pillar 1.  Their payments are being topped by the national reserve up to the national average, and then they are getting another top-up on top of that of 25%.  They are also getting preferential treatment in Pillar 2.  When we open the TAMS scheme in a few weeks time, they will have the option to get a 60% grant rather the 40% grant everyone else receives.  That is a strong package for those farmers.  There are some farmers who feel they have been locked out of that system because they missed out on installation aid or started farming six or seven years ago and, therefore, are not defined as young farmers in the regulation.</p> <p> We went back to the Commission and advised it of the farmers who came into farming just after the installation aid scheme was closed by the previous Government and who cannot now qualify to be young farmers.  We said we thought they were a disadvantaged group and wanted to help them.  The Commission has accepted that and, as of today, such farmers can apply to the national reserve to get a top-up of their single farm payment up to the national average, which is a significant boost for that category of farmer.</p></speech>

Does the Minister intend to re-examine the situation and ensure farmers from 2008 and 2009 and those who received installation aid, which was a finite sum of money, have access to the national reserve, the BPS greening and the TAMS top-up on the same terms as everyone else?</p></speech>

We are now trying to fix that problem and re-prioritise that category of farmers.  We have worked with Macra na Feirme and all the farming organisations to try to do that.  They were celebrating when the CAP deal was done in terms of the package for young farmers.  Perhaps the Deputy should check the views of young farmers on that.</p>  <p>  On the issue of trying to sort out this cohort of people, whom many thought it was impossible to help given the tight definition of "young farmer" in the regulation, we have found and worked out a way with the Commission to categorise them as a disadvantaged group and, therefore, a group of people to whom we can give assistance through the national reserve.  We have done that to the fullest extent we can.  People who just missed out on installation aid but who started farming more than five years ago can apply to the national reserve under phase 2 of the application process to get a top-up of their single farm payment up to the national average.  For many young farmers who have low payments, that is a very substantial top-up.</p></speech>

There have been long delays in issuing herd numbers and difficulties for farmers in tying up leases, land and so on.

My understanding is that the farmers who qualify as young farmers have not had a major issue with the application dates.  If I am incorrect, I will happily listen to those arguments, but my understanding is that there is not a big issue.</p>  <p>  With regard to Pillar 2 payments and the rural development programme, we do not have a national reserve to use.  We have that under Pillar 1, and that is how the rules work.  We are using what we have in Pillar 1 to try to help this group of people.  The Deputy should not forget that these farmers will have the option to get all the other supports we are rolling out anyway through the rural development programme; we should not take that for granted.  These are very attractive schemes with very good support measures.  The people in question are not defined as young farmers in the same way as those who are defined under the regulation and therefore they will not be getting the kind of top-ups under Pillar 2 payments because we do not have a mechanism to do that.  They will be getting favourable treatment through the national reserve under Pillar 1.</p></speech>

Under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, payments to participants fall into two categories of either area-based actions or and non-productive capital investment actions.  Participants can receive payments for both actions, which are combined to give an annual payment to the participant.  Non-productive capital investments would generally be the purchase and planting of trees and hedgerows.</p>  <p>  Under the AEOS, participants must submit a claim for payment for non-productive capital investment actions, supported by appropriate proof of purchase, such as receipts and invoices for trees and hedgerow plants.  A review of a sample of claims submitted was undertaken in 2014.  This review identified serious irregularities with some of the claims submitted.  The Department then instigated a full investigation into the matter.  Under the circumstances, all AEOS payments to participants which are the subject of the investigation were put on hold.  My Department wrote to each of the participants concerned on 28 January 2015, explaining the situation.

There are many very good farmers out there and many of them expected this money before Christmas.  They are under serious financial pressure.  They have gone to different public representatives, expressing how banks are putting pressure on some of these farmers.  The money has not come.

Many parts of Roscommon and east Galway, particularly the northern part of the area, have heavy, water-logged soil.  The southern part of the area is a limestone karst region.  However, they are not considered to be water vulnerable areas.  We have hit the headlines regarding the cryptosporidium in our water and many communities throughout Roscommon and east Galway have boil water notices in place.  We have issues regarding trihalomethane, an organic contaminant, in our water.  Why are we examining only water courses and not also aquifers and heavy soils?</p></reply>

GLAS is Ireland's new and innovative agri-environment scheme.  Two GLAS actions are specifically designed to address the risk of what is known as point pollution in rivers, that is, pollution directly related to bovine access.  These actions are protection of water courses and riparian margins.  To achieve the maximum environmental benefits from these measures, my Department, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and using data supplied by the agency, has identified certain reaches of rivers throughout the country categorised as high status water and vulnerable status water.  Farmers with these areas will receive tier 1 or tier 2 priority, respectively, in the approval process.</p>  <p>  In both cases, the identification of the areas concerned was completed using an EPA data set.  Spatial queries were run against the data set to identify the land parcels held on my Department's land parcel identification system, LPIS.  The criteria used by my Department were that the land in question had to be declared by the applicant as "forage" on the 2014 single payment application, it had to be within a 15 m buffer of the water course identified in the EPA data set, and the applicant had to have bovines in either 2013 or 2014.  For vulnerable water areas, the holding had to be identified as comprising at least 50% wet soils.  The classification of all holdings in this fashion is stored on my Department's new, online GLAS system and is currently being used by farmers and their advisers to identify the actions required, as well as the tier position they hold.</p><p>The Deputy was in contact with some of the technical staff in my Department on this issue during the past week and they briefed me on that.</p></reply>

However, the fundamental issue is that many parts of County Roscommon are not considered to have heavy soils.  Even if the river is low-status, farmers will not be eligible under this provision in GLAS.  In other parts of the county and east Galway where there are heavy soils, eligibility is confined to farmers who are "m&eacute;arning" water courses.   There are many karst limestone regions in my part of the country where rivers travel underground.  No provision has made for them.  They are vulnerable areas - we have evidence of this in the series of boil water notices in place throughout County Roscommon and east Galway - but no recognition is being given under the scheme for these catchments.  Why are underground rivers excluded and overground rivers included?  Why is it that only pristine overground rivers will automatically result in access to the scheme if a farmer is "m&eacute;arning" the river but there has to be poor-quality water and poor marginal land for them to be eligible where the rivers are not up to standard?</p></speech>

Under cross compliance provisions and other EU directives, farmers have serious responsibilities in respect of protecting them and they are very much aware of that.  We can only do so much with GLAS.  We had to prioritise and we sat down with EPA officials and spoke to representatives of the NGO community and farming organisations.  We tried to put together a straightforward scheme that is easy to understand, implement, enforce and so on.  There are other environmental challenges that need potentially to be promoted, which are not covered by GLAS.  The scheme does not do everything but it does a great deal and, in the same way that REPS and AEOS did not do everything, they had a function.</p>  <p>  We are using EPA maps which identify high-status and low-status watercourses.  In each case bovines must be present and the parcel must be contiguous with the watercourse.  In the case of low status, a further factor is employed to make it a qualifying vulnerable site - that is, the holding must have at least 50% wet soils.  We can identify these parcels on our LPIS database and, from an enforcement point of view, that makes sense.  While it is not perfect, we are doing a great deal for watercourses.</p></speech>

The source of the contamination is hard to know and it will never be proven.  At the same time, an environmental scheme is being introduced and approximately one third of those eligible under AEOS and approximately one third of those who were eligible under REPS will be able to apply under GLAS.  This means that only approximately one sixth of farmers in east Galway and County Roscommon will be in a position to apply for inclusion in the first two priority areas.  Those who fall outside them are unlikely to receive financial assistance in this regard and they will not be encouraged to go forward.  We are losing out significantly because of the criteria under the scheme, which are focused more on tillage regions than on vulnerable farms with bovines and sheep in the west, particularly in an intensive production area such as County Roscommon and east Galway.</p></speech>

When one talks to arable farmers, one does not get that reaction.  We are prioritising commonage farmers here.  We are prioritising farmers in SACs.  If anything, there has been an emphasis on grass-based agriculture in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  It is simply not true to say that only a third of farmers in AEOS can apply for this.  Many more farmers will be going into GLAS than ever went into AEOS.  We hope there will be 30,000 in the first tranche and there will be another 20,000 next year, to bring it up to 50,000.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate the important contribution the Teagasc advisory service is making in assisting the development of the agriculture and food sector and in providing advice and support to farm families, particularly at this time, given the opportunities there are for expansion and growth.  The service engages with 60,000 farmers per annum, of whom approximately 40,000 are contracted clients.  We continue to require a strong input from Teagasc advisers to support sustainable and profitable farming into the future.</p><p>My Department has been actively working with Teagasc to ease staffing difficulties in the organisation.  Within the constraints of the moratorium, more than 60 permanent appointments were authorised on an exceptional basis since 2009<i>.  </i>A further 20 contract teachers were approved in the agricultural colleges to meet the demand for green certificate courses.  Teagasc also employs 190 non-Exchequer funded contract staff outside the moratorium framework to deliver advisory and research programmes.  The announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in budget 2014 regarding delegated sanction for staffing arrangements will provide greater discretion to Departments and State agencies over staffing levels, but strictly within an overall pay framework.  My Department has submitted a pay and staff numbers strategy to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration in respect of the State bodies that operate under the aegis of the Department, including Teagasc.  It is expected that the delegated sanction arrangements will be finalised shortly and will provide some flexibility to fill critical posts within agreed pay ceilings. </p><p>In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has approved Teagasc to fill a small number of front-line posts in the advisory service.  The allocation of advisers to particular locations is an operational matter for Teagasc to determine, but I understand it intends to appoint a dairy adviser to the Louth-Meath-Dublin region shortly.</p></speech>

I know it not something the Minister can simply sanction.  There are rules and regulations, and with the moratorium on recruitment of staff, there are certain routes that must be taken.  However, I come from a county that has a very dedicated farming community, in particular a very dedicated dairy farming community, which has been left without an adviser since last August, when the previous adviser left.  It is not good enough that they have been left since then and that we have not had some sort of response until now, especially as we are coming into April.  The timing could not be worse, with the abolition of quotas.  Now more than ever, farmers need the advisers there to ensure they have advice on how it affects them, how they may need to adapt, and how they can benefit from it.  Some of the farmers have said they will withhold their subscriptions from Teagasc, which none of us wants to see happen.  I am glad to hear that there is movement on it.  I ask the Minister to continue treating it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

All of these will want to do so on the back of a good business plan, working with their advisory service to ensure it is done in a way that is sustainable, profitable and well managed.  Teagasc faces multiple challenges, including helping people to put GLAS applications together.  It has a strong research focus with places such as Moorepark.  It also faces a very strong educational challenge, and we have looked for more staff for it because our agricultural colleges are more in demand than they have ever been.  The advisory service is a crucial link between all Teagasc does and on-farm activity.  This is why I agree with the Deputy that the ambitions of the farmers in Meath in terms of improving their farm practices mean we need to have an advisory service which is fit for purpose.  This is why I have spoken to Teagasc about it, and I understand there will be some movement on it soon.</p></speech>

We have already had a discussion on it.  When the Food Harvest 2020 targets were set and the policy was put in place by the previous Government, the three buzzwords were smart, green and growth.  This is fundamentally what we are trying to do in agriculture.  We are trying to get growth while ensuring it is based on innovation and new and better ways of doing things and in a way that is green and protects the environment, watercourses, biodiversity, rural life and rural incomes in the best way we possibly can with regard to reducing the emissions intensity of food production systems.</p>  <p>  We are the only country in the world that is auditing farmers and how they run their farms from a sustainability point of view.  This is what has been rolled out over the past two years on beef farms and what is being rolled out on dairy farms.  Farmers sign up to outsiders coming in and auditing them once every 18 months.  This is a sustainability audit system which has international certification.</p>  <p>  We are planning growth and expansion between now and 2020.  A group of people is planning for growth between now and 2025 to replace the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  The sector constantly needs a ten-year horizon for ambitions so that we all know where we are going and what we are trying to finance with regard to growth and strategy.  By the middle of the summer we will launch a new 2025 strategy for agrifood expansion and growth and technological advancement.  A major part of the challenge is sustainability.  People should not simply state that as our target is to reduce emissions by 20%, agriculture must apply that 20% reduction.  It is a much more complex argument than this.  I assure the Deputy we will do everything we can and we will be a global leader in finding ways to reduce the emissions intensity of our food production systems, but we will allow the country to fulfil its full potential in terms of the volumes of food we are capable of producing from the national resources we have.</p></speech>

It may well come to pass that another Commissioner with other intentions may decide to introduce a measure in the equation which could put pressure on the Minister and the agrifood sector in the country, particularly in the context of EU-US trade negotiations.</p><p>Arising from that, will it be possible to ensure we convince our colleagues throughout Europe to facilitate and take into account not only the measure about which the Minister has just spoken, but also the degree to which carbon reduction is in place in this country at present and has been for some considerable years, far in advance of most other European countries?</p></speech>

The EU plans to set very ambitious targets for 2030.  I think it is right to do so.  We have insisted that the complete picture from land use will be factored into those targets.  We have had a very active afforestation programme, for example.  This has essentially involved planting forests on agricultural land.  That has a significant carbon sink value and should compensate for emissions coming from herds in other parts of agriculture.  If targets are to be set for agriculture, those targets have to factor in agriculture and land use.  They have to factor in the positives as well as the negatives with regard to emissions and carbon sinks, etc.  Before Christmas, we successfully got that wording into the European Council decision on the setting of targets.  We reaffirmed that recently at the Environment Council when one or two countries sought to remove the land use element from what is factored into the targets.  The Commission has confirmed that it is very much there now.  This is good news from an Irish perspective.</p></speech>

If someone in some other commission has a brainstorm and tries to increase the area of wetlands in this country, perhaps in an attempt to create a European carbon sink, that will obviously have a detrimental impact on our agrifood sector.  In view of our economy's high dependency on the agrifood sector, is the Minister completely satisfied that he will be in a position to ensure that sector continues to grow?  Will he take account of the development of non-fossil alternative fuels in this jurisdiction to reinforce his argument and intensify the case on behalf of the Irish economy?</p></speech>

That is why we have special areas of conservation and we protect species like pearl mussels, breeding waders and hen harriers.  The restrictions that are imposed on farmers to protect vulnerable species are very controversial in some parts of the country.</p></speech>

That is an important part of farming here and people need to understand it.  Having said that, I intend to take the significant opportunities that are available in the different sectors.  Last week, we launched an energy crops support package for farmers who are willing to plant wood coppice, which is basically willow.  It suits certain types of land and can produce a very profitable margin if it is grown correctly and in the right proximity to where it is to be used and burned.  We are supporting all these sectors.  Energy crops will be part of the agrifood story in Ireland.</p></speech>

This deadline has been extended to 22 May.  Will he not consider extending that to 15 June as there is no physical way 30,000 applications can be made by 22 May?</p></reply>

Their professional expertise and experience are vital to the preparation of reliable GLAS applications that fully comply with regulatory and scheme requirements.  That is why I have made it mandatory for all GLAS applications to be submitted by an approved GLAS adviser.</p>  <p>  The negotiations with the European Commission on the scheme's details were long and protracted, which is why the earliest date I could open it was 23 February 2015.  The original deadline set for submission of applications was 30 April.  Admittedly, this was tight but there was no real opportunity to extend this without impinging upon the deadline for direct payment applications generally, a deadline fixed for many years by regulation as 15 May.</p>  <p>  However, I have been working closely with the European Commission to get this regulatory deadline extended and I am delighted we have achieved some flexibility on this front.  While we do not yet have the Commission's proposal, it is my intention to extend the GLAS deadline to 22 May, if possible, which will provide significantly more time to submit applications for this first tranche of GLAS.</p>  <p>  To date, I am pleased a total of 9,119 applications have been created on the GLAS online application system.  We are almost at the 10,000 mark and there is still quite some time to go.  It is possible to push the basic payment and GLAS deadline back to the middle of June but there would be consequences to that.  I am determined to get our basic payments out to farmers at the earliest possible date in mid-October.  If we push the applications dates back, then the processing becomes much more difficult with the time available.  I am also anxious that there would be at least a week separation between when the GLAS deadline and the basic payment closes.  We do not want them all coming in on the same deadline with farmers who leave it to the last minute trying to get all their basic payment and GLAS applications in on the same day.  We do not want our backs up against the wall but to have a little bit of breathing space, which is why it is the end of May for the basic payment scheme and a week earlier, 22 May, for GLAS applications.  There is some flexibility with these dates but I would like us to achieve our deadlines by these dates too.</p></reply>

One has to register at the beginning of the process.  Will the Minister tell me how many completed applications there are for GLAS?</p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister said there were 477 accredited GLAS planners.  As there is much work in these plans, these planners will probably produce 40 plans each, a plan per working day.  This only gives 20,000 plans by the current deadline.  To my knowledge, there are only 9,000 completed plans so far.  Will the Minister accept there is no way he will have 30,000 completed plans by 22 May?  Is there a legal possibility under the regulation to have a later closing date for GLAS than for the basic payment?</p></speech>

As one is linked to the other, the GLAS application has to be finalised first and then the basic payment after that.  We could push them back into June but that then has consequences for registration.</p><p>I would expect planners to get far more than one application per day.  The fact that an average of about 700 applications are being received per day is proof of that for starters.  Effectively, there are two months left.  Many planners would have prepared in advance.  They knew what was coming, had a pretty good idea what GLAS was going to look like and have already done an awful lot of work.  They have put their applications up on the system and are waiting to simply submit.  There are over 9,000 applications ready for submission, all the work having been done to date.  We are making good progress.  I am not saying everything is perfect, because it is not.  We are looking for people to make constructive criticisms of the application process so that we can keep improving it as it goes along.  If anybody had suggested that by this point in time we would have nearly 10,000 applications ready for submission, most people would have been pleasantly surprised.  That is where we are.  We are making good progress and will continue to monitor it tightly as time goes on.</p></speech>

The Minister studiously avoided telling me how many of those are completed applications or how many have just been initiated.  I would have expected a big flush in the beginning because of people having done the preliminary work.  Could the Minister send me the figure regarding the number of farmers who have submitted a completed final application?</p>  <p>  In a reply last week, the Minister told me that there was &euro;1.4 billion for agri-environment schemes under the present CAP, including transitional payments.  He might tell me how much of that &euro;1.4 billion relates to the GLAS scheme as opposed to transitional payments.</p>  <p>  In the event that there are fewer than 30,000 applications, will the Minister consider approving the applications and letting them become operational as they are processed rather than waiting for everybody to be processed before they are all let go on the same day?  The big advantage of that is that people would get payments far earlier and would get a significantly bigger payment this year than if they are all held back until the last application is processed.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that we will get this system approved as soon as we can but we will not discriminate against anybody in the process and we will be as fair as we can.  When GLAS is fully up and running it will cover around 50,000 farmers and we will be spending about &euro;260 million per year on them.  This is a big environmental scheme.  This year we have estimated about &euro;20 million, because we know we are not going to be accepting people approved into GLAS until about September, so farmers will only be getting payments for the last few months of the year.</p></speech>

I have two specific questions.  Will the Minister introduce additional flexibility into the <i>force majeure</i>scheme to improve the single farm payment and bring it to a viable level for farmers who established prior to 2008 with poor entitlements?  Can the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, see if a mechanism can be found to allow farmers who established prior to 2010 to avail of some additional incentive for on-farm investment?  I am talking primarily about those who did not get into the installation aid scheme.  Could there be some incentive to access that is similar to TAMS?  Could there be a mechanism for those who established prior to 2008 to top up low payments where they are unable to avail of the new definition of a young farmer?</p></reply>

As the Deputy might remember, that resulted in a very comprehensive tax package on budget day.  I think there were 23 measures, many of which were new.  The total tax package was worth about &euro;300 million for farmers.  We did some very strategic things, particularly around rental land, moving away from conacre towards long-term leasing and so on.  That engagement on agricultural taxation is continuing.  It was not the case that it continued only until the last budget and then was shut down.  We are continuing to look at new ways in which we can do strategic things such as encouraging generational change, partnerships and other efficiency and modernisation and sustainability programmes within agriculture.  We will see where that takes us.</p><p>We are looking at the area of <i>force majeure</i>and how we can prioritise people in terms of using the national reserve most effectively, particularly with regard to people who under the Scottish derogation rules would be able to get the single farm payment and who might not have had it for a series of reasons over the past number of years, or farmers who would have been farming on &quot;naked&quot; land.  We will look at how we can use that, but I do not want to give an exact commitment on individual cases at this stage.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will recall that on 25 March 2014, he informed the House that the former Garda Commissioner was resigning.  He said that announcing his retirement must have been a very difficult decision for the Commissioner to make.  The Taoiseach also announced that he was establishing a commission of inquiry into the tape recordings in many Garda stations since the 1980s and the potential impact of the contents of some tapes on cases being heard, cases going through courts, cases to be followed and cases that are yet to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  Observing the civil case of Ian Bailey, I did not see the world collapsing in terms of any recordings of phone conversations at Garda stations.  I remember that when the Taoiseach asked myself and Deputy Adams in on that date, there was a certain sense of very grave issues around phone recordings that would essentially undermine almost the entire judicial system and could lead to the unravelling of many convictions.  When he informed the House of the Garda Commissioner's resignation, the Taoiseach did not mention that he had sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Commissioner's house.  The entire Cabinet found out about the former Commissioner's resignation through the media despite the fact that the Taoiseach had had some very important meetings at the time with key officials and, in particular, with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p> I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach.  In the first instance, why has the Taoiseach consistently refused to give a straightforward account to this House of all the circumstances that led to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner and the reason he sent the Secretary General to the home of the former Garda Commissioner?  Second, can the Taoiseach confirm if he was called to appear before the commission a second time, if he believes that in confirming this he would be breaking the law, and what law forbids the Taoiseach confirming whether he gave evidence?</p> <p> In regard to the module of the Fennelly commission dealing with the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner, will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the House that he will publish the final draft report of that module immediately it is received by him and that there will be no attempt to delay its publication?</p></speech>

The reason for setting up the Fennelly commission of investigation was the recording over many years at Garda stations of citizens' telephone calls without their knowledge.  This matter was brought to my attention at that time, with potentially serious consequences.  The commission of investigation was set up primarily for that reason.  The Deputy has also tabled a parliamentary question to me on this matter.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to the Government having made the decision to establish the commission the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality wrote to me and requested that two other matters be included in the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  These matters were the sequence of events leading to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner and the matters concerning the issuing by him of a letter in regard to matters raised a number of days previous.  I agreed with the Oireachtas committee and included those matters word for word in the terms of reference of the Fennelly investigation.  The Deputy's comments today differ slightly from those he made previously about the Fennelly commission.  Mr. Justice Fennelly has an exemplary record.  It is a matter for him as to how he conducts his investigation.  He is not subject to pressure from anyone, including the Deputy or me.</p>  <p>  On the question of my contributing to the commission of investigation, I have complied fully with my responsibilities in this matter.  Mr. Justice Fennelly wrote to me and I responded to him.  I was called before the commission of investigation and I responded to that.  The law states clearly that it is offence to make any comment about any evidence given before the commission.  I took that view literally.  I am satisfied that I have complied with my responsibilities in so far as the commission of investigation is concerned.  The Deputy can rest assured that when Mr. Justice Fennelly issues the final report in respect of the commission of investigation, I will publish it.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to understand the reason he refuses to confirm that.  There is no law that says he cannot say whether he has attended the commission.  The law under which the commission of investigation was established does not state that.  It does state that a person may not go into the content of the evidence given, but no one has asked that the Taoiseach do so.  As I understand it, the Taoiseach was only asked if he been recalled by the commission or if he appeared before it a second time.  It is clear from comments made by the commission spokesperson, who is a solicitor, and the law itself that there is nothing stopping the Taoiseach confirming whether he was called to appear before the commission a second time.  It is important that a Taoiseach does not cite something that is not true.  It is not true for the Taoiseach to say it is an offence for him to confirm whether he appeared before the inquiry a second time.  The Taoiseach has stated publicly that it would be an offence to do so.  It would not.  The Taoiseach should withdraw that public assertion.  As leader of this country he needs to state clearly what the law actually states and not otherwise.</p></speech>

That is what the Government approved at my request.  The commission is independent and not subject to pressure from any quarter.  The terms of reference are very clear.  They were adopted by the Government and voted on and adopted by this House.  They include the two matters referred to by me in response to the Deputy's earlier question.  This was part of a series of changes in the judicial system, including the establishment of a policy authority to restore trust and confidence in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the justice system in general.  The Deputy will be aware of those changes.  The Deputy will also be aware that I published Mr. Justice Cooke's report in June 2014 and Mr. Guerin's report in May 2014.  As in the case of Mr. Justice Cooke and Mr. Guerin, Mr. Justice Fennelly should be allowed to do his work.  I take the view that the law is clear that it is an offence to comment in respect of any evidence given before the commission of investigation.  As I said earlier, I am satisfied I have complied fully with my responsibilities in terms of my having responded in writing to Mr. Justice Fennelly and having appeared before the commission.  Mr. Justice Fennelly should be allowed to finalise his report.</p>  <p>  In terms of the requests I received, both of which were in writing and have been published, the first was in respect of a request for an extension of time, which was granted.  I can confirm to the Deputy that whenever Mr. Justice Fennelly submits his report, it will be published.  The intention is that it will be published.  It is a commission of investigation report that will not be a secret or left lying on a shelf.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100018#Q01600"><p>I have received representations from families of clients of the Redwood care facility in County Meath.  One such client, Eamonn Kennedy, was admitted to Redwood in January 2010.  I have his family's permission to raise this case with the Taoiseach.  Following several falls in Redwood, Eamonn was hospitalised with a head injury and lacerations.  He was hospitalised a second time with further lacerations and bruising to his upper body, arms, abdomen and legs.  In 2012, a consultant in emergency medicine noted that several aspects of the bruising were suspicious of non-accidental injury and that there appeared to be no medical explanation for that bruising.</p>  <p>  Another citizen, who, prior to moving to Redwood in 2013, was living independently with HSE support, within two days of moving to the facility was given anti-psychotic medication and taken off his gluten and dairy-free diet despite family objections.  He suffered nine convulsions and was admitted to hospital a few days later.  He subsequently returned to Redwood and remained there for three months on anti-psychotic medication against his family's wishes.  He is no longer living at Redwood.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has said that there is a significant denial of the civil, legal and human rights of citizens at Redwood and that residents there have also been subject to severe deprivations of liberty and freedom of movement, including a locked door policy.  It should be remembered that citizens at this facility are there on a voluntary basis and that their care at this private practice is being paid for.  Given these disturbing reports and others which have come to light about other care centres, is it not the case this State is failing in its responsibilities towards citizens with intellectual disabilities who are residents of these facilities?</p></speech>

I have said on many previous occasions that the fragile, elderly and vulnerable deserve to have nothing but the best level of care and consideration given to them irrespective of where they are.  I am aware that there are regulatory process issues at Redwood and I understand that HIQA is in discussion with it about these matters.  When the example of &Aacute;ras Attracta was brought to the notice of the House, I said that was not an example of care, but an example of control over fragile, vulnerable and in some cases voiceless people.</p>  <p>  The HSE is taking a series of actions.  The next national meeting of all the care providers takes place on 9 April and I understand that will be the second meeting in as many months.  Clearly between this and then, the issue at point between HIQA and the managers in Redwood is one that will obviously be followed through.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, there are also the whistleblowing procedures put in place by the HSE and a confidential recipient in respect of complaints in this matter, Leigh Gath, has been appointed.  I am not sure whether the complaint in respect of this particular nursing facility was brought to the attention of the confidential recipient.  It is a serious matter and I hope it can be brought to a conclusion where the truth of the matter can be held and that patients not just there, but everywhere else, receive the highest level of care and consideration from those who have responsibility for them in these circumstances.</p></speech>

I also raised these in writing with the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  I also sent him photographs that Eamonn Kennedy's sister, Maeve, took of his injuries at that time.  The Garda has also investigated the matter.</p>  <p>  At the core of this is the concern among people about outsourcing care for citizens with a disability to the private sector.  The care of our most vulnerable citizens is not compatible with the profit motive.  Redwood is part of the privately-owned Talbot group that is contracted to the HSE to provide services.  In December, HIQA reported that in this facility there were recurrent and lengthy durations of physical intervention; there was an incident in which a patient struggled to breathe and turned blue during physical constraint; and medication was administered by injection during episodes of challenging behaviour.  HIQA further recommended that no new admissions be allowed until these issues were addressed.  As the Taoiseach has said, we will see all of that working its way out in the upcoming period.</p></speech>

I believe the Taoiseach when I hear him saying that citizens should have the very best care possible, but that is not happening.  Where it is not happening, how are we to know about it?  Will it be a drip feed?  Is it not now time to have a fully independent root-and-branch inquiry into all care facilities for citizens with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, in the State?</p></speech>

I empathise with the Deputy's comments in respect of the persons whose cases he has mentioned here and is entitled to raise with their permission.  How will we know about these things?  Clearly, there have been incidents in the past, the last of which was the &Aacute;ras Attracta case, which brought about a real focus on how exactly people should become aware of lack of care, attention and consideration.  That is why the confidential recipient was appointed and that is why HIQA in its independence - it is completely independent in how it carries out its responsibilities and in its authority - is entitled to examine this centre or any other centre and bring its findings to the attention of the HSE, but also to the attention of the proprietors and managers of any facility where this applies.</p>  <p>  I do not have the detail of the HIQA analysis to the extent that the Deputy has before him.  However, all in the House would share the view that elderly, vulnerable, fragile and voiceless people deserve nothing but the best level of care and attention.  That is why we have a confidential recipient.  That is why we have a completely independent authority that is able to analyse these things.  Where there are criminal activities, they are a matter for the Garda to investigate, as it has done and is doing in a number of cases.  In terms of care, consideration, treatment and comfort for elderly people who are residents in locations such as this or patients in nursing homes, we must be seen to be able to uphold the very highest standards.  Where that does not apply, the law must apply and appropriate action must be taken.</p></speech>

Given that his memory is normally pretty good, I was surprised that he failed to recall it.</p>  <p>  In 2012, a garda went to see the Taoiseach in Castlebar and told him about serious malpractice by a certain superintendent in the Athlone area.  He told the Taoiseach, "If you don't do something about him, you will be reading about him in the papers".  The Taoiseach expressed shock at that time about what this gentleman told him.  However, later that year the Taoiseach gave approval for the promotion of this superintendent to chief superintendent.  This same chief superintendent is now the subject of three different investigations.</p>  <p>  That same garda contacted the Taoiseach again in November 2014, which is why I was particularly surprised that he did not remember him in January.  Even though the garda highlighted more malpractice by the same gentleman, he has since been moved to Phoenix Park to work in the implementation of the Garda Inspectorate report.</p>  <p>  What hope is there for reform as long as the old hierarchy remains in place?  Surely the Taoiseach must realise this is part of the problem and not the solution.  It is more than a year since the Taoiseach got rid of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  At this stage I am beginning to wonder why he bothered.  The new Garda Commissioner is cut from the very same cloth and we are not looking at much different.</p>  <p>  We have been speaking to some new whistleblowers of late, some of whom are trying to raise issues regarding garda&iacute; involved in the drug trade.  I will tell the Taoiseach what they are facing: harassment, bullying, intimidation, cover up, denial and delay.  In one internal investigation, the garda about whom complaints had been made is being kept informed while those making the allegations are being harassed - all under the watch of the new commissioner.  The same internal investigation has been going on for 11 months.  It appears as if they are trying to break the man and I think they might.</p>  <p>  Why would any garda be a whistleblower if it means being isolated and harassed for doing the right thing while the person about whom he is complaining gets promoted?  Is the Taoiseach aware that since the Government did away with the confidential recipient, there has been no place for Garda whistleblowers to go because GSOC is not geared to deal with it?  What will the Taoiseach do about it?</p></speech>

That appointment should be made very quickly.</p>  <p>  I do not accept what the Deputy says regarding bullying, harassment and the other issues he mentioned.  I asked the Deputy for a note in respect of what he raised, but he chose not to respond.  I would appreciate it if he would do so later.</p></speech>

He did not address the issues I raised.  I never said the Taoiseach promoted him.  I said he approved of it.  Why would he approve the promotion of a superintendent to chief superintendent after being made aware of the fact that he was involved in serious Garda malpractice?  Why in God's name would he do it?  Will the Taoiseach explain that?  He talks about the greatest reforms in the history of the State - what a load of baloney.  He promised all kinds of reform last summer but it has been so minuscule, it is an embarrassment.</p>  <p>  The Guerin report was released last May.  The Government only established a commission of investigation nine months later.  We probably will not see the full report of the Fennelly commission until after the election.

I believe that such support would be required if consideration of an honours system were to proceed.  While I have no objections to all-party consideration of this matter, the timing of any such consideration would have to take into account other political priorities at the time.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy Keating has had an interest in this matter for some time and he has mentioned to me that he has carried out extensive research.  If he wishes to forward that research, I will be happy to talk to him about it and have it examined.</p></reply>

I am grateful to him for acknowledging the number of occasions I have raised this issue.  The record will show that I raised it previously in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to use a pun but this proposal has considerable merit.  Ireland is one of the countries that does not have an awards system to acknowledge the accomplishments and efforts of people, some of whom might be known and have a high profile and others who are unsung heroes in their communities.  It is long past time to introduce such an awards system.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to the fact that I have carried out research on this.  I have spoken to diplomats, ambassadors and people from other parts of Europe.  This is in place in a number of other states.  I recall a debate on this issue in 2011 to which Members such as Deputies Martin, Adams, Mathews and Durkan contributed.  Unless I misread the situation completely, there was a positive response to this issue and, frankly, I hoped that it might have been progressed to a further stage by now.  Subsequently, I had a meeting with the Chief Whip and there was agreement that we would take it to a further stage and discuss it with the other party Whips and so forth.  I am disappointed that we have not moved to a further stage, but I am anxious to continue to explore this option.  I believe it would be in the national interest.  It would give recognition to people, many of whom might be known and popular but many of whom might not necessarily have such a profile, are unsung heroes in their communities and make various efforts in their lives and in society.</p>  <p>  I am interested to hear what the other Members say before I make concluding comments.</p></speech>

In fairness to Deputy Keating, he has raised the matter each year since 2011.  He has been consistent in doing so.  It is not the first time this has been suggested but the absence of all-party agreement is the deterrent or obstacle.  Article 40.2.1&deg; of the Constitution clearly states that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.  The last attempt to do something about this was by my predecessor, former Deputy Bertie Ahern.</p>  <p>  There are a number of schemes run by the State whereby the State recognises and rewards merit, distinction or bravery in particular cases.  These include the President's Award, Gaisce, for young people.  That is a scheme where young people are challenged to use their leisure time for positive development and the betterment of their communities.</p><p>Gold, silver and bronze medals are presented by an tUachtar&aacute;n as a recognition of that achievement.  That scheme has not been established on a statutory basis.</p> <p> The second is the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad.  This was introduced in 2012.  The distinguished service award is presented by an tUachtar&aacute;n to persons who live abroad.  Primarily, these are Irish citizens who are entitled to Irish citizenship or persons of Irish descent who have made a sustained and distinguished service to Ireland or to Irish communities abroad.  A total of ten awards are made each year.  I understand you have attended a number of these, a Cheann Comhairle.</p> <p> The third is Aosd&aacute;na, the national scheme to honour artists whose work has made an outstanding contribution to the arts in Ireland.  It offers to those who need it a basic level of financial security to enable them to devote their energies fully to their particular art.</p> <p> The fourth is the National Bravery Awards awarded by the Deeds of Bravery Council.  The council awards medals and certificates for deeds of bravery.  A deed of bravery is defined as an effort to save human life involving personal risk.  The council awards gold medals, bronze medals and certificates.  It may also pay compensation to recipients or their dependants.  Another example of this type of award is the Scott Medal awarded annually by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for bravery.  The gift is presented by the Garda Commissioner but awarded by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p> <p> The fifth is the Volunteer Ireland awards.  These are presented in recognition of people who are unsung heroes and who have given time volunteering throughout Ireland.  Nominations are forwarded by members of the public.  The categories include arts, cultural media, sports and recreation, health and disability, children and young people, campaigning and awareness raising, community education and training, social work, animals and environment, and international development.</p> <p> There are commercially sponsored awards ceremonies as well which recognise contributions to sport, business, charities etc., for example, the Rehab People of the Year awards, the Irish Film and Television Academy awards, the Irish Times InterTradeIreland awards, which are for young innovators and small businesses, the RTE Sports Person of the Year award, and the Entrepreneur Of The Year award, which is presented in three categories: engineering, industrial and international awards.  There are 24 finalists and the winner goes on to participate in the World Entrepreneur Of The Year.</p> <p> I know Deputy Keating has done some research on the matter.  If he wishes to converse with me about it I would be pleased to do so.  He may wish to engage with the leaders of the other parties with a view to this.  Within the constraints of Article 40.2.1&deg;, under which nobility and titles are not awarded by the State, we have a range of opportunities to reward people for exceptional performance and so on.  Perhaps Deputy Keating might wish to take that up.  I would be happy to converse with him further on the matter.</p></speech>

We need to be careful.  I have always had an open mind but, as a republican, I have a view that there is always a question mark around the State bestowing honours on people.  Unfortunately, in Britain we have seen the system there abused by political parties.  The system was brought into disrepute for electoral and political gain and there were allegations of fund-raising in respect of honours being bestowed on people.  That is a significant issue as well.</p>  <p>  We discussed this last as an Oireachtas or as a country in 1997, if I am not mistaken.  The political parties discussed the matter at the time.  Several awards, including the Gaisce and Aosd&aacute;na awards as well as a number that are independently decided upon, are outside the political or State system.  There are set criteria, particularly for the Gaisce award for young people.  Has the Taoiseach looked at reviewing the Gaisce award?  It is an excellent awards system that challenges young people to achieve certain objectives in certain disciplines and areas.  It is a quiet, understated awards system that has significant benefits for the young people concerned as well as for communities of young people who engage in various challenges to attain either the bronze, silver or gold medal.  We should not shy away from celebrating or supporting the Gaisce award and ensuring it is well-resourced in terms of the management and administration.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept the basic principle that those responsible for our Constitution took a deliberate decision?  They did not want the State to have a direct awards scheme.  Does the Taoiseach accept that principle?  Does he accept that our Constitution provides for an explicit ban on the creation of titles of nobility?  Is that something the Taoiseach agrees with?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has enumerated some of the awards that represent a recognition and celebration of people in sporting organisations, the arts and community activists.  It is good that society reflects this.  Members of the media deserve their just awards as well for the work they do.  It is important to give credit and praise.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach referred to the Gaisce or President's award.  This is a successful awards scheme that brings considerable benefits to the young people who participate.  T&aacute; fadhbanna leis sa Tuaisceart &oacute;s rud &eacute; go gcaithfidh daoine &oacute;ga ann dul tr&iacute;d an Duke of Edinburgh's award chun cl&aacute;r&uacute; le Gaisce.  There is a problem in the North.  I have made representations about this.  Young people who wish to avail of the President's award or Gaisce have to go through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.  God bless the Duke of Edinburgh, but there are some young people there who do not want to apply for the President's award through the Duke of Edinburgh's scheme or system.  We find, therefore, almost by default, that young people in the North are unable to apply for the President's award.  We should perhaps tease this out and have a genuine debate.  Whether people are in Ballymena or Ballycastle at the tip-top of Antrim or in the tip-toe of Cork, they should be able to be part of all this.  This gives me the opportunity to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the matter.  Will he review this arrangement in order that groups or individuals in the North can register directly for Gaisce?</p></speech>

These people could be broadcasters, journalists or even the odd politician.  There are many people who would merit special recognition.  Provision is made in other constitutions, such as the French Constitution, for an awards system, for example, <i>la L&eacute;gion d'honneur</i>.  In Germany there is a similar system.  In the United States there is the Congressional Gold Medal.  These awards are not handed out liberally.  They are unique awards for unique service.  Perhaps over the passage of time there has been something of an aversion to recognising a major or great contribution in society, apart altogether from the individual awards mentioned by An Taoiseach.  Would it be possible, in conjunction with the other party leaders, to look again at the prospect?</p><p>We must not allow a system to develop in which it becomes everybody's award.  Rather, it should be because a particular contribution to society merits a unique award.  It would be for that purpose only.</p></speech>

In July 1930, Mr. Blythe, as Minister for Finance of the Executive Council, decided that unofficial negotiations on the matter of an Irish honours system should be opened with the British Government at the earliest convenient opportunity.  This was not pursued prior to the constitutional changes in 1937, at which point it became entirely a matter for the Irish Government.  The system he had in mind was the Order of the Legion of St. Patrick, of whom there would be 25 commanders, foreign persons chosen by the Executive Council to be honorary commanders, with not more than 50 to be officers and not more than 100 chosen by the Executive Council to be members.</p></speech>

A draft memorandum setting out those general lines for a State declaration of honour was circulated to the Departments of Finance and External Affairs for observations.  The system they proposed comprised An Chraobh Ruadh and An t&Oacute;rdan Feibhe.  The Taoiseach was to make proposals to Government.  An Chraobh Ruadh - the Red Branch - would be limited to 25 persons, with An t&Oacute;rdan Feibhe, first class, limited to 100 persons, and second class limited to 250 persons, and distinctions to be conferred by the President on the advice of the Government.</p>  <p>  In 1948, the draft memorandum was brought to the attention of the new Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, who decided that while the matter should not be abandoned entirely, it should be deferred for the time being.  In 1953, a revised draft memorandum, based on the 1946 version, was brought to the attention of the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, who, having consulted his Cabinet colleagues, decided that the time was "not opportune" for the institution of an honours system.  In May 1956, the Minister for Defence submitted a memorandum to the Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, who decided that the question should be left aside for further consideration at a later time.</p>  <p>  In November 1959, following more public discussion, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, indicated that the matter should not be pursued actively until such time as there emerged evidence of widespread public interest.  The following January, the Department of External Affairs suggested the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to examine the matter.  This was not pursued in view of the Taoiseach's decision the previous November.</p>  <p>  In 1963, the Government, following consideration of a memorandum from the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, approved in principle a proposal that a State declaration of honour be instituted.  It authorised him to consult with the Opposition leaders in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with a view to securing their acceptance in principle of the proposal and agreed that if the concurrence in principle of the Opposition parties was obtained, the details of an appropriate scheme would be settled by a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach wrote to the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  The Labour Party responded that before it could agree even in principle to the proposal, it would prefer to have talks on the type of scheme envisaged, while the Fine Gael party simply indicated that it would not be expedient at that time to proceed with this proposal.  In view of this, the matter was not pursued.</p>  <p>  In March 1991, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, wrote to party leaders inviting them to exploratory talks on the introduction of an honours system.  All party leaders responded, saying they were willing to meet the Taoiseach.  The leader of the Workers' Party felt it was not a priority and, if a system was established, it should be free from political patronage and should not be hereditary or of monetary value.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party asked that the Taoiseach outline the system he had in mind, while the leader of the Labour Party simply accepted the invitation.  However, these talks did not take place, as the political climate was not right.  The issue was viewed as low priority and there was a lack of public demand.</p>  <p>  In April 1994, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, wrote to Opposition party leaders asking for their views on the introduction of an honours system.  The only reply he received was from the Fine Gael Party leader, who stated that he supported the concept in principle and was willing to participate in an exploration of the idea.  He explained and suggested mechanisms for selecting people.</p>  <p>  In September 1999, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, initiated consultations with other party leaders.  He asked the Government Chief Whip to represent the Government at a meeting with representatives of the other party leaders.  Senator Manning, representing Fine Gael at the time, subsequently wrote to the Chief Whip indicating that, having consulted with the Front Bench, the overwhelming majority felt the question of an honours system should not be pursued further.  The Taoiseach accepted the views expressed and decided not to do so.</p>  <p>  In October 2007, the Taoiseach again wrote to the party leaders, inviting them to discussions.  Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in responded favourably, while the Labour Party indicated it would bring proposals before the parliamentary party.  The last Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, did not pursue the matter with the other party leaders, indicating in a response to a parliamentary question that the timing of any consideration of this matter would have to take into account other political priorities.</p>  <p>  There has been, therefore, an 80-year consideration in this regard.  Article 40.2.1&deg; still stands in that the State shall not award titles or nobility.  I take the point made by Deputy Martin in respect of abuse of this in hereditary or monetary terms.</p></speech>

What I am trying to do is to ensure the current Taoiseach is not added to that list, if this is raised in 20 years time, although I say that with tongue in cheek.  I am aware there is a long history associated with this request and that many others have pursued it in the past, although I did not know just how long the history was.</p>  <p>  In reference to the Taoiseach's' earlier comments, I would be grateful if this could be taken a stage further and if the Taoiseach would agree to present this to the Whips and the party leaders for discussion.  Given that I have been raising this over the past four years, perhaps we could agree on a specific timetable to at least arrive at a decision and maybe save others time in the future.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could report back to me in four to six weeks, if that is reasonable.</p></speech>

It demonstrates a lot of uncertainty, a lot of hesitation and a lot of doubt.  However, I recall one thing that has happened in past years - that Dr. T. K. Whitaker, who is now 97 years of age, was honoured by being declared the Irishman of the 20th century.  It is in that sort of context that I say this could be the first toe-testing, if one wants to put it that way, of a President's honours list - not an award but rather a President's declaration of particularly productive contributions to the people of Ireland.  That is the way I would take it, given that there has been such going around in circles for 80 years.  We could make one move forward in that regard.</p></speech>

The committee includes the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Lord Mayor of Cork, the chairman of the Red Cross, the Cathaoirleach and myself.  To be honest, the stories we have received from throughout the country are astonishing in terms of the acts of bravery performed by people we never read about.  The biggest problem we have is to try to get people to make submissions.  One particular case that will always stick in my mind is that of two young guys who, while on their way home after celebrating their leaving certificate results in Fermoy, noticed smoke coming from the upstairs window of a house.  They broke down a door and went in, through thick smoke, risking their own lives.  They pulled out somebody who was unconscious, brought him out and resuscitated him on the footpath.</p><p>The person told them there was another person inside.  One of them took off his jacket and went back in - there were flames at this stage - and dragged out the second person.  I never read or heard about this, but these are the sort of things that are happening.  We present the awards in Farmleigh each year and the amount of goodness that happens that we never hear about is incredible.  Perhaps I should not intervene as Ceann Comhairle, but as chairman of the bravery awards I will mention the incredible information that comes to us.  We are very careful about the level of awards we grant depending on the acts performed.</p></speech>

It has four members, namely, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The council met on three occasions this year.  The last meeting took place on 4 March.  It has met the banks on three separate occasions.  The meetings took place on 9 November 2011, 21 February 2012 and 26 June 2012.  Following the adoption of the statement of Government priorities in July 2014, a review of Cabinet committee structures took place and a number of changes were made.  However, the Government decided that the EMC should be retained in its current format to continue its work in securing economic recovery.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100023#V01500"><p>I put it to the Taoiseach that from day one the main concern of the Government has been to spin its role on a range of issues rather than showing form in terms of substance.  Central to all this was the establishment of a Cabinet committee which was pompously titled the Economic Management Council.  An army of advisers spent countless hours talking about the importance of the EMC, themselves and their political bosses.  The reality is that the EMC has been a way of making the Cabinet and Government less relevant and far more centralised than the Constitution ever envisaged.  The Constitution is very clear about the role of Government, that is, that it should be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  It is a fact that the EMC has never produced a fiscal strategy.  There has been no new fiscal strategy for three years.  It has never published a full economic strategy.  If one listened to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, the Ministers, Deputies White and Coveney, and others, one would find it has been a way of keeping normal discussions away from Government and the public.  The water debacle was a classic illustration of that.  It provided for the &euro;500 million for water meters, devoid of any accountability.</p>  <p>  On the forthcoming campaign event, which has been called the spring statement, will the Taoiseach say whether the EMC will be taking the lead role on that?  The spring statement is due to involve civil servants in writing the document.  The Taoiseach has confessed that the document is primarily about setting out Fine Gael and Labour Party policies beyond the next election.  Will he outline on what legal basis he is using significant amounts of Civil Service time to write a document which has no formal status?  It is not a White Paper or Book of Estimates, it contains no financial resolutions and will be immediately superseded by the budget.  Will he confirm that is the case?</p>  <p>  For most of last year we had weekly exclusive stories on tax cuts about to be handed out by a very generous Government.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the status of those stories?  We read about them every day.  Are they cleared by the Taoiseach and the EMC before being released?  Is he keeping a list of them or will it be like last year where the leaks went far beyond anything that subsequently materialised in the budget?</p>  <p>  The EMC decided four years ago to end the practice of providing detailed distributional impact information for budgetary proposals.  It seems to me that the reason it did that was to save the Labour Party's blushes due to Fine Gael's very regressive approach to budgetary and fiscal changes and the unfair policies that were allowed to dominate.  One would argue that this is very basic material.  The Department of Finance has all that material and historically has always produced it.  Will the EMC lift a ban on its publication when the spring statement is issued?  Will we be allowed to see the full impact of the announced policies rather than just the ministerial spin?</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that by law all budget proposals should be prepared in light of an analysis and recommendations from the Fiscal Advisory Council.  It is a legal position.  Will the law be followed, for example, for the spring statement?  If it is not, it will be transparently and purely an electoral event and Fine Gael and the Labour Party should be asked to reimburse the taxpayer for the costs.  Article 28.4.1&deg; of the Constitution states: "The Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann."  Instead, the D&aacute;il is treated essentially as a rubber stamp in all this.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the position of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, on the EMC?  She pouted a lot prior to becoming T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party about not being on the EMC and not being given access to its work.  Some Ministers, such as Deputies Varadkar and White, have complained publicly about the role of the EMC and their lack of engagement with it.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, did previously but has gone rather quiet on the issue.  What is the up-to-date position of the T&aacute;naiste?</p></speech>

The basis of this procedure emanates from Article 28.4.3&deg; of the Constitution which states, "The confidentiality of discussion at meetings of the Government shall be restricted in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter".  Consequently, questions related to the activities of individual Cabinet committees are not in order.  That is the advice that has been given formally to the House.</p></speech>

I choose to devote one day per month to them.  For instance, yesterday I started at 8.30 a.m. and finished at 7 p.m.  I went through a range of ministerial responsibilities, programmes and policy issues that need to be moved on by individual Departments or where there is a relationship between Departments and Ministers.</p>  <p>  The EMC was set up for a very good reason.  Given the scale of the economic crisis that faced the Government when it was appointed, it was necessary to have a focused entity that could regularly examine the evolving and changing economic landscape.  As the Government comprised two parties, we believed it was important that there be that level of contact, as required, between the leaders or Ministers of the parties, as would apply.</p><p> The overall mandate of the Government was to fix the public finances and get our country back to work.  The Economic Management Council, EMC, has in my experience allowed for very regular contact between the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on issues arising every day of the most serious import.  They concerned matters relating to the European Central Bank or questions about bailout negotiations etc.  These discussions also concerned budgets in very difficult financial circumstances.  The EMC is not the Government and there has not been a case where any discussion taking place at an EMC meeting suddenly became Government policy.  It is necessary for its members to go before the Cabinet so that these matters can be discussed and formal agreement can be given if required.  It is often the case that a view reached by the EMC might not emerge from the Cabinet at the end of the day, as other views might have been expressed.</p> <p> Given the scale evident of where we were, this was a very important entity.  As Deputy Martin is aware, the number of meetings we have had this year is smaller than the number we would have had per year in the middle of this crisis.  I genuinely believe the EMC has an important value in keeping the Government focused on the central remit, which is to continue to secure the recovery, achieve full employment by 2018 and allow for constant changes in the way business is done and the kind of environment in which business can operate.</p> <p> The spring economic statement is not a mini-budget and it is not a case of using the occasion for the purpose of making announcements that apply to the budget.  It is an important entity for the Government to be able to set out its views about the challenges that lie ahead, the kind of business environment we would like to see and the strategy the Government will set out that it intends to follow as far out as 2020.  Deputies are aware that national programmes are set by and in conjunction with the European Commission that are published in or around May each year.  These are normally low-key programmes but the spring economic statement allows for the inclusion of these kinds of programmes in setting out the general environment and challenges we see up ahead.  As I said, the EMC is not the Government.  It meets as appropriate, depending on the issues that arise.  The EMC will meet representatives of the banks in due course in regard to an agenda dealing with mortgages and rates etc.</p> <p> To respond to Deputy Martin, the spring economic statement is not a budget or a litany of announcements about matters being implemented.  It is to set out for everybody the opportunity to engage themselves in where our country is headed in the time ahead.  The strategy will consist of the announcement of the spring economic statement, followed by a consultation and engagement with elements of the public and other sectors before the drafting and presentation of the budget in October.  It is good that there are definite dates set for the implementation of budgets so people know those timelines.  That has been of value.  That will be the process following through the spring economic statement, leading to consultation and the presentation of the budget.</p> <p> The independent fiscal council is an important entity.  It is a watchdog independent in its analysis and views.  The Government is not bound to take those views into account but it is an important entity in its own right.  People can see the opinions and views of experts in the financial field, including what they would consider important to implement.  The view of that economic council in terms of fiscal adjustments would have been more severe in some cases than what the Government did.  It is for the political process to assess what decisions have to be made and how best they might be implemented in the interests of working towards full and sustainable employment, continuing to reduce our debt and making serious progress to wipe out our deficit, as well as having full employment by 2018.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100024#W00600"><p>One of my questions is about the Taoiseach giving us a view on the continuation of the Economic Management Council and the suggestion that it should not be retained after the period of the fiscal crisis.  Another question relates to frequency of meetings with banks.  I accept entirely what was read to us.  It is interesting to note that in several newspaper reports earlier this month, the Minister for Finance was quoted as telling a Fine Gael parliamentary meeting that the Economic Management Council discussed the question of insolvency legislation and mortgage arrears.  It appears there is no difficulty briefing the Fine Gael Members or the media of discussions within the EMC but we in the D&aacute;il cannot be briefed on these matters.</p><p>Having made that point, my main question is whether this management committee should be retained.  It has been described, variously, as autocratic and dictatorial.  The Taoiseach has stated this is not the Government but it has been described as a government within the Government.  That is not coming from us but people within the Government parties.  Others have stated it undermines the role of Ministers and the Cabinet while enhancing the power of unelected civil servants and party advisers.  Mr. Pat Leahy, in his book, <i>The Price of Power</i>, identifies one key reason for its existence.  He argues that one senior Minister put it to him that the Cabinet &quot;leaks like a sieve&quot;, so perhaps it is about preventing leaks and control.  Last November, one of the Taoiseach's backbenchers, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, called for the disbandment of the EMC and suggested its operation might even be unconstitutional.  A Minister, Deputy Alex White, warned that the council should not become a fixture of the political system.  He specifically called for the role of the Economic Management Council to be re-examined.  Has this been considered by the Government?</p><p>Last month, the Taoiseach reported that the Economic Management Council met representatives of the banks on three occasions, which were in November 2011, February 2012 and June 2012.  That means it has been almost three years since the EMC last met representatives of the banks.</p><p>Given the central role that the banks must play in any fair economic recovery, is it right that there were no meetings for three years?  We all know about the number of mortgage accounts which are in arrears and the pressure on householders, which is rising and will continue.  Many times, I have raised with the Taoiseach the problem with banks not lending enough money to small and medium enterprises.  Is it not a glaring fault that the Taoiseach did not meet with the banks on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100025#X00200"><p>It is not about control, but focus on the challenges and issues that must be addressed and the kinds of views that should be presented to the Cabinet for its consideration so that we can make decisions on them.  I have never favoured holding endless meetings without a focus in which everybody throws in opinions just for the sake of it.  While I am not suggesting this happens at Cabinet meetings, it is far more efficient to set out a number of views, identify the challenges we face and discuss how we will deal with them.  The spring economic statement, which will be led by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, will include a stock take of economic performance, a discussion on the developments taking place in the public finances and how this will fit in with the stability programme update, which is a requirement under European legislation.  The statement will set out what the Government feels are the challenges that lie ahead during the coming years.</p>  <p>  One of the issues is that the Government has set out to reduce our deficit below 3% this year - it will be well below 3% - and to eliminate it by 2018.  This means we need to create 40,000 jobs this year and 40,000 next year and in 2017 and 2018, respectively, to recover all the jobs that were lost during the recession.  Tomorrow, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will publish the live register, and we hope the positive trend will continue.  Deputies will be able to contribute to the focus on economic and financial challenges, including the potential risks and challenges that lie ahead.  This is where we want the spring economic statement to be focused.  Given the progress the country has made, and the sacrifices people have had to make, we do not want to lose the momentum.  Our intention is to set out the parameters and secure the future and the recovery so that people all over the country can benefit from it.  This will be important in the sense of setting out where we are.</p>  <p>  We hope, in 2015, to exit the excessive deficit procedure, look ahead to 2020, hold a public consultation, present our budget, let the independent Fiscal Advisory Council present its views and publish the information leading up to the budget so people can assess its impact and put forward alternative proposals.  While the spring economic statement is technical in many ways, it is also political and financial in its setting out of the strategy the Government will follow and our intention not to go backwards but to secure the recovery and move forward.  Around the country, in the different sectors, what I see is very encouraging.  As I have said on many occasions, the credit goes to the people.  However, it is the Government's responsibility to secure the momentum and progress, and this requires clarity and clear decisions.  For this reason, I am a very strong supporter of the concept of the EMC.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked whether the T&aacute;naiste attends the EMC.  She does attend, and contributes very worthily to it.  Arising from the meetings, people have a better perspective on the decisions the Cabinet must make.  I repeat, it is not a mini Government but a process of streamlining work so the Cabinet can make decisions.  The EMC will meet the banks in the period ahead.  We have already committed to bringing in a number of changes to the situation in so far as mortgages are concerned.  The Government will deal with it in April.  The Government has put together a suite of options, including the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  Although the ISI may not have dealt with as many cases as people might like, banks have reached acceptable and satisfactory conclusions in more than 100,000 cases.  These settlements had been vetted by the Central Bank, and the vast majority are working satisfactorily.</p>  <p>  I hope the process that lies ahead will prove successful and that Deputies on all sides will contribute to it in a way that will make it worthwhile.  Everybody will have an opportunity to comment on it.  Following it, there will be a process of public consultation, during which people will be entitled to send their views and observations as the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform set out their views regarding the budget, which will be presented by the Minister for Finance.  Some time before the summer, the Government must reflect on the capital programme for the coming years, given that there are serious infrastructural deficiencies in various places around the country.  There are other programmes that need to be followed through, such as the building of schools and primary care centres.  These matters will come before the Government for decision and we hope to deal with them before the summer so everybody can have his or her say and we can discuss the budget in October.</p></speech>

This seems a very poor reason for the establishment of the EMC.  The Taoiseach can have this regular contact with the T&aacute;naiste whenever he wants to.  Some two thirds of the measures needed to reach the 3% deficit target had been taken by the previous Government before the EMC was established.  The rationale for it has never been fully articulated, given its quasi-constitutional status.  Although the Taoiseach would have voted against all the budgetary measures taken by the previous Government, he now takes credit for them and their contribution to getting the deficit below 3%.  The four-year plan that the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, produced was done without any EMC.  The full Cabinet participated in it without any emergency fiscal council.  The funding arrangement with the troika, which provided the funding for three years of the plan, was done and dusted before any EMC had been established.  The Taoiseach would agree with these facts.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to ascertain the role of the EMC and the Cabinet in the episode detailed in Pat Leahy's book, when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had proposed to burn the bondholders.  We were all sitting here in the D&aacute;il when the Minister for Finance arrived in 20 minutes late because he had received a phone call from the then Governor of the European Central Bank, Mr. Trichet, who had told the Minister that if he tried to burn any bondholders, a bomb would go off, not in Brussels but in Dublin.</p><p>The Minister had to back down, it seems, unilaterally and on an individual and solo basis.  He might have told the Taoiseach or whatever but it seems quite a number of Ministers who were sitting in the House waiting were taken by surprise that his statement on that occasion did not include any reference to the burning of bondholders.  It perhaps exposed the falsehoods that were perpetrated before the election that the bondholders would be burned and they were not but, again, there has never been any accountability about that.</p> <p> Equally, the assertion has been made that the EMC is about keeping issues under control and avoiding leaks, as was pointed out in Mr. Leahy's book.  It is extraordinary that &euro;500 million in expenditure was approved by the council for the installation of water meters with no accountability to the House in any shape or form.  The House was told that because Irish Water was a semi-State entity, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government did not have to answer questions and, therefore, we can find out nothing about the awarding of the contracts for the installation of meters because that is all considered to be confidential for alleged commercial reasons.  It is an extraordinary fact that the central role of the EMC in the water meter story has been to keep it all hidden from public view.  As a result of the mechanisms adopted, such as using NTMA money as a borrowing instrument, which was approved by the council with no questions allowed in the House, no questions have been answered in respect of any aspect of that.  One is led to the conclusion that the role of the council is to ram through measures about which people, even within the Cabinet, might ask awkward questions.  They did not get the opportunity to do so.  We are aware of the battle that ensued in respect of water services subsequently.  There were approximately 13 U-turns with legislation rammed through the House in 24 hours twice to deal with the issue.  By any yardstick or objective assessment, the EMC did not cover itself in glory on that issue, notwithstanding the fact that its role has been over hyped by a Government that was focused on spin rather than reality</p> <p>The Taoiseach has stated the spring statement will not be a budgetary statement and further stated, "It is an opportunity to engage ourselves in where the country is heading".  I do not know what that means.</p></speech>

The big issue at the moment is what type of recovery we are experiencing.  While I listened to what the Taoiseach said, it is also patently obvious that this is a two-tier economic recovery.  He just glossed over the big issue, which is the fact that he has not met representatives of the banks for three years and the fact that they have a veto over citizens' mortgages.</p>  <p>  When I tried to unravel the issues around Irish Water and the &euro;85 million in taxpayers' money given to private consultants, I could not get to the bottom of who took the decisions.  There are not even records of minutes of meeting between the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the chairwoman of Bord G&aacute;is.  I understand what the Taoiseach is saying about the need for focus and we all have examples of meetings that did not have focus but the EMC appears to me to be almost a subversion of the Cabinet's collective responsibility for governance on the crux issues facing people.  It is easier to control a small group such as this to take decisions and then, in an ongoing atmosphere of crisis, to push them through.  The big issue around Irish Water and other matters I have raised is there were no proper debates in the House.  The guillotine was used time out of number and sensible amendments tabled by the Opposition parties, including by Sinn F&eacute;in, were totally ignored or voted own by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach ignored my question, which is a suggestion from others, including those in the Government.   I asked him to comment on whether the EMC should be retained following the period of fiscal crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100026#Y00900"><p>In respect of Deputy Adams's final question, I stated in my reply that the Government considered this.  We made changes last year to the structures of Cabinet committees but one thing we did not change was the retention of the EMC.  It is an important element of running government efficiently.  It is not a government in itself.  It is not only a way of focusing on the challenges we face but also a way of setting out the options for the Cabinet to consider and make decisions on.</p>  <p>  The decisions that are the subject of valid discussion and accountability in the House were made by the Cabinet in respect of Irish Water and, in some cases, by the regulator which is independent in its duty.  The value we see of having more than 600,000 meters installed is in allowing people to beat the cap but also in identifying 30,000 leaks that need to be fixed.  The statistics in this regard were released earlier.</p>  <p>  The banks will meet with the EMC in the next period and the Government will bring forward a number of changes to the mortgage regime in April.  Nobody wants to see anybody lose a house where that is humanly possible and that is why we want the best range of options and opportunities for people to deal with this issue.  A total of 100,000 have been sorted out successfully.</p>  <p>  The taxation system is an issue for the budget and the Minister for Finance will consider all these issues.  We expect that up to 500,000 people will be taken out of liability for the USC in the October budget if we can continue the progress made.</p>  <p>  The spring economic statement will not be a general election document and it will not be a series of announcements about things that are happening.  It will be an opportunity for the D&aacute;il to discuss the financial position and economics of the country and, as both Deputies said, the direction we are headed and where we want to be in five years.  Where we want to be is in a country with full employment, a well managed economy, jobs for everybody who wants one with the opportunity for people to come back home and powering ahead as an energetic, committed country where innovation and research change the frontiers ahead.</p>  <p>  In 2013, there were quite a number of guillotines in the House.  That was very much reduced last year.  There were significant debates on Second and Committee Stages of the Water Services Bill 2014.  The Government parties made decisions and they are accountable for them at Irish Water level.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Martin finally, it is true that the late, lamented Minister for Finance had begun to make a number of changes.  He said to me on a number of occasions that he was finding it difficult to have the then Government respond to the alarm soundings he was putting out there.  Clearly, the catastrophic decisions made by that Government at the time were indicative of parties being unable to talk to each other.  It came to the point where Ministers resigned from Government and others could not be appointed to particular portfolios.  Deputy Martin decided to leave himself in the middle of all of that.</p></speech>

This legislation refers to the Government commitment to bring "to an end the unacceptable Executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions".  The Taoiseach could not answer that basic point last week.  In total, 23 meetings took place between Bord G&aacute;is and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government between April and September 2012 on Irish Water, of which just ten had minutes.  Of those ten, half had just one typed page of notes.  There were two meetings between the former Minister, Phil Hogan, and Ms Hynes later in 2012 which were not minuted.  In total, four meetings between the former Minister, Phil Hogan, and Bord G&aacute;is officials were not recorded.</p>  <p>  The level of non-compliance engaged in by the former Minister in his discussions with Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water itself regarding the formation of Irish Water is extraordinary.  All of this has been revealed by RTE&rsquo;s "This Week" programme.  No minutes or notes were taken at at least half of all meetings between the Department and Bord G&aacute;is.  What was going on?  Why were all these meetings being held?</p></speech>

This year, a poor and deservedly criticised 2016 centenary programme was published.  This, at last, is a step in the right direction.

Will the Government engage in the widest consultation to ensure the battlefield site, that is, all of Moore Street and the lanes of history, is properly developed?  When will the national monument Bill be published?</p>  <p>  We have been told, week in, week out, that the review of the fair deal system is on its way.  This morning, there were 501 citizens on trolleys and again in Our Lady of Lourdes yesterday there were 54 and today 52 citizens on trolleys.  In February, 9,600 people were on trolleys.  We all understand that the provision of additional bed capacity and the reform of the fair deal nursing home scheme to facilitate the resolution of problems with delayed discharges are key to resolving this issue.  Given the older population and the number of citizens who are dependent on care provided by nursing homes, this delay is baffling.  Last month, the Minister said the review was on the Secretary General&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>That was last month.  When will it be published and will the Government allocate time to debate it?</p> <p> Last week the Government published the heads of the international protection Bill, which is intended to reform the direct provision system through the creation of a single application procedure.  Within 48 hours the CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, Sue Conlan, resigned from the McMahon working group because she stated the working group is not allowed have sight of or discuss the Bill about which she has expressed reservations.  The Taoiseach previously told me the report by the working group chaired by Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon will be published by Easter.  It is only a few days before Easter.  Will it be published before then?  When will the report be given to the Minister?  Will the Taoiseach commit to a debate in the D&aacute;il when it is published?  Will he commit to a firm date for the publication of the international protection Bill as well?</p></speech>

I met Mr. Justice McMahon recently at a function.  He and his group have been working exceptionally hard on this matter, which is quite complex.  The report is not completed yet but I fully accept what Mr. Justice McMahon has stated, that he will produce it as quickly as he can.  I commend him on his efforts to date with his group.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has made some resources available which should ensure the fair deal waiting list is down to approximately four to five weeks which would be acceptable in all circumstances.  The review will be presented by the Minister.  I cannot give the Deputy an accurate date for it but it is his intention to deal with it.</p>  <p>  The national monuments Bill is for publication later this year.  With regard to the question on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, it is a national monument.  Attempts have been made to deal with the issue over the past dozen years, but it is not all within the remit of Government as the Deputy is aware, as it also involves Dublin City Council and various owners, planning permission, objections and court cases.  I am glad to say it was possible, with the assistance of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to be able to purchase the site and put it in public ownership where it can be dealt with comprehensively as a national monument.  This does not deal with the statutory responsibilities of Dublin City Council, planning authorities and the area around it, which is very important given the history of 1916 and what happened there.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will lead this and she will discuss how best to present what will become public ownership of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, where the decision was made to effect a surrender, and how it will be made available for members of the public and visitors and in what format given that it is a protected structure and will be publicly owned as a national monument.  The question of the battlefield is being discussed and I am quite sure the Minister will be willing to listen to propositions about it, but for now this is a clear decision in respect of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, which is a national monument and is becoming a publicly owned national monument.  I thank the very many people over the years who have consistently made the case that this is an important building and a seminal moment in Irish history.  I am glad it has been possible for the Government to put it in public ownership and discuss how best it can be presented for the next 100 years as the location where those who rose and fought and were executed made the decision to end the 1916 Rising.</p></speech>

I was horrified to find out an hour ago that a rough sleeper who intends to sleep on the streets of Dublin tonight was told today by Focus Ireland that it has no dry, fresh sleeping bags to give them.  If we are talking about a housing strategy, we should be aware that it is horrendous that someone cannot get a sleeping bag to sleep rough tonight in this weather.  I know the Taoiseach will be horrified to hear that a person who went to Focus Ireland to seek a sleeping bag was refused one because Focus Ireland has none available.  The person was told that Focus Ireland might be able to meet them tonight at 7 to give them a sleeping bag.  It is a horrendous situation to be in.</p></speech>

Perhaps Deputy Collins will give me the details of the person she has come across.  This should not happen.  There are many opportunities to cater for rough sleepers.  This is happening every night when the count is made.  There are locations that one can call to ensure a sleeping bag is provided for a rough sleeper that one has come across.</p></speech>

It is a beautiful town located on the River Blackwater and has a fabulous four-mile beach, the best salmon fishing in Ireland, and so on.  For many decades we have turned our backs to the sea.  I am glad to note that the Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success.  Unfortunately, it does not extend to east Cork.  Despite the fact that east Cork is also on the Atlantic coast, the Wild Atlantic Way ends in Kinsale.  West Waterford is also on the Atlantic coast.  However, that is another day's work.</p>  <p>  The abolition of the travel tax and the retention of the reduced VAT rate applicable to the hotel and tourism sector were positive measures, as a result of which tourism continues to grow.  The recently launched strategy People, Place and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025 is also a very positive initiative.  There is massive potential in marine tourism.  In this regard, I reference the study by Carina Ginty in 2010 entitled Marine Tourism Business Sector in the West of Ireland - Capabilities, Performance and Contribution to the Regional Economy, in which she points to a number of issues, including the fact that in terms of tourism policy, there is no lead agency in Ireland responsible for marketing and product development of the marine tourism business sector.  In this regard, a person wishing to establish a marina is directed to the tourism section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, only to be told it is a matter for the marine section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  When the person then seeks to take up the matter with that Department, he or she is directed to the local authority, Tourism Ireland or F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There is no one agency responsible for marine tourism.  I suggest that the Minister take this issue on board in the context of the establishment of the tourism leadership group.  He might also take on board what has been done in Newfoundland in this regard, which initiative has been a great success.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that we have neglected the marine sector for many decades.  The Wild Atlantic Way is a first step towards addressing that neglect.  The CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland stated recently that with sound and sensible development there is no reason Ireland should not aspire to increase its marine tourism revenue by 2020 and, ultimately, treble its revenue earnings to &euro;1.5 billion.  What I would like to know from the Minister this evening is the point of contact for a person wishing to develop a marina and other ancillary marine facilities in a place such as Youghal or another similar area around the country.  Youghal has a lot going for it.  There are 7,000 people living in Youghal town and it has great heritage and history.  As I have said here previously, Youghal was once so busy it was the second busiest port in the British empire.  It is an amazing place, yet there are no berthing facilities there for visitors.  Many boating enthusiasts and other people have asked me to whom they should speak in this regard.  There is no one agency with responsibility for this.  </p>  <p>  The Minister needs to get together with other Ministers and the agencies to ensure the establishment of one agency with responsibility for the development of marine tourism.  Ireland is an island.  It is surrounded by water, which is our greatest asset.  We have seen what the Wild Atlantic Way has done for the west.  It has been a tremendous success.  The Minister should, perhaps, give a medal to whoever came up with that idea.  Youghal straddles west Waterford and east Cork and, as such, is caught between two counties.  Nothing is happening there.  How can we make things happen?  What can the Minister do to help?  Will he consider proposing to his Cabinet colleagues the establishment of a lead agency to deal with marine tourism?  At the very least, can the Minister facilitate bringing all the agencies around the table to discuss what can be done, if not nationally, for Youghal, which is a beautiful, picturesque, historic town.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100032#EE00400"><p>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  The short answer in regard to who should deal with this matter is reflective of the broader challenge we face in terms of how we market and develop a tourism proposition for the city and county of Cork.  In February this year a group, consisting of representatives from the Cork county and city local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and various stakeholders in tourism, was formed to examine how a single tourist offering and brand for the county and city of Cork could be developed.  I will write to the group on the specific point raised by the Deputy and ask that marine tourism form part of its work.  That is the best way of addressing the issue raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that work is under way in relation to the development of a new marketing framework for the south and east of the country, taking into account the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, how Dublin is marketed and how all the facilities in the Deputy's county and constituency, and the county and constituency of Deputy Regina Doherty, can be pulled together into a single framework through which we can market all that that part of our country has to offer.  This framework will be ready for launch to the trade at the end of April.  I believe this is the mechanism through which the facilities about which the Deputy spoke could be better marketed.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding who is responsible for the development of new marine infrastructure for Youghal, I will communicate that information to the Deputy.  I can say, however, that all costs in this regard are eventually borne by the taxpayer through either a State body or my Department.  To justify the spending of such moneys, we need to have a business case to underpin it.  For this reason, I believe the best way to address the issues raised is by way of the group established in February.  This group is a response to the challenge of developing a good marketing strategy for Cork.  It is the right way to go.  On foot of this discussion, I will contact the group and ask that the marine tourism sector be integrated firmly into its work plan.</p></speech>

While what the Minister has proposed is excellent, as are the other initiatives taken in this area, the situation about which I am speaking is different.  We need to focus specifically on the marine sector.  For many years now we have turned our backs on the sea and ocean surrounding Ireland.  With the advent of liners coming into Cobh and other places, there is huge potential in this area.  The south coast of Ireland is on one of the busiest sea routes in the world.</p><p>In the UK, France and Spain, there are marinas with hundreds of boats and yachts tied up.  Why can we not do the same?  It is because we did not have a focus or a plan.  I am concerned that if it is considered on a county-wide basis the marina will again be sidelined and forgotten.  I ask the Minister to consider focusing specifically on the marine element.  I am certainly not suggesting ignoring the rest, but we need a specific focus on matters marine and marine tourism.</p> <p> On the development of marinas, I take the point that it needs a business plan and a cost-benefit analysis, but that has all been done; the Marine Institute has carried out several studies.  I understand - the Minister might correct me if I am wrong - the section in the Marine Institute that dealt with that no longer exists, which, if true, would concern me.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Coveney, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and others.  He should look at what has been done in Newfoundland and other places.  Can we have one agency dealing with matters to do with marine tourism?  At the moment, if one goes to the local authority one is referred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which refers one on to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which in turn refers one on to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  One is going around the houses, with nobody responsible.  We want one agency to pull it all together, with one head who will take this on, one person who will have the passion and drive to make it happen.  As I said in my initial contribution, the potential is huge, but we have turned our backs on matters marine for a long time.  We are beginning to focus on the Wild Atlantic Way and we can see how much it has yielded and the fantastic thing it is.  There is so much more we can do, but we need leadership and drive.  I admit that it will cost money, but it will yield multiple amounts.</p></speech>

However, we have not been focusing on it.  We have been touching on it here and there.  I am calling for one lead agency, one lead person, to take it on, examine it and drive it.

I believe the strategy that came from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which had the support of the Department of the Taoiseach, regarding harnessing our ocean wealth, provides a very good framework to respond to the opportunities that the marine offers overall.  This matter has been progressed by both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  However, I understand that the opportunity of marine tourism overall does not feature as highly in that framework as perhaps the Deputy would want.  The following is being done to progress the need he has identified.  Research is under way to consider the development and funding of marina and berthing facilities around the coast.  In that regard, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is considering an all-island cruise strategy.  I know this does not cover all of what the Deputy is referring to, but that work is under way and will be complete by September.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe the other opportunities the Deputy mentioned are the responsibility of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to endorse and support the campaign that has been mounted by cyclist organisations, cycle clubs and even some of our professional cyclists in recent times.  If he is not aware of it, I will give some background.</p>  <p>  The Stayin' Alive at 1.5 campaign seeks to pursue the adoption of a new law requiring motorists to give cyclists 1.5 metres of clearance when they are being overtaken from the rear.  It is a two-pronged campaign that is being undertaken on Facebook and other social media, and more importantly through lobbying individual Deputies.  Through that medium it was brought to my attention, and I carried out some research.</p>  <p>  The current law in the Rules of the Road only suggests that a driver should give extra space when overtaking a cyclist and makes no mention of minimum clearance.  The aim of Stayin' Alive at 1.5 is to have this distance clearly defined as 1.5 m and to replace the word "should" with the word "must".  The current law on dangerous overtaking only states: "A driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, if to do so would endanger, or cause inconvenience to, any other person."  However, I am not sure that the driver of a 40-foot truck or a very large bus has full cognisance of how intimidating the vehicle is to a cyclist on the road.  The very small distance that is currently being observed between drivers of very large vehicles, and even some cars, and cyclists on the road is causing such fear among cyclists that they have mounted this campaign.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to look at how infringement of the current law is being policed, for want of a better word.  I do not believe it is being policed in any meaningful way.  I cite a very personal example.  I suppose all politics is personal, because it does not affect one until it comes into one's home.  A few weeks ago an incident happened involving my husband, who is an avid cyclist, and a very large bus.  He felt extremely vulnerable one evening.  When they caught up with each other at traffic lights and he went to take a photograph of the bus, the driver of the bus got out and was exceptionally aggressive both verbally and physically with him.  That makes the cyclist even more vulnerable.  It brought home to me that the drivers on the road do not have the respect for cyclists that they should have.  While we are not talking about all people, many people do not see cyclists as legitimate road users.  This campaign is aimed at making people realise that cyclists are legitimate road users.  They are not just adults; many of them are children, and we need to recognise that they have a right to be on the road.  They do not have any less of a right to be on the road just because they do not pay road tax.</p>  <p>  We need to recognise that cyclists are vulnerable.  The Minister could make a clear statement by changing the law to define the minimum overtaking distance as 1.5 m and to change the word "should" to "must".  It would be a clear indication from Government that we respect cyclists and appreciate that they are vulnerable, given their position, and that we will do everything we can to ensure they can use the roads safely.</p></speech>

As she will be aware, last year 12 cyclists died on our roads.  This compares with five in 2013 and eight in 2012, which is absolutely unacceptable.  I am very much in favour of promoting the wider use of cycling.</p><p>The Deputy is entirely correct that a cyclist on the road is a legitimate road user with the same expectation of safety and respect as somebody in a car.  Whether they have paid car tax is not the issue.  They are using a road with the expectation of being able to commute safely.  That is a right which should be respected and upheld.  The other side of the coin is that they have responsibilities, as do other road users.  I am confident that the overwhelming majority of cyclists are aware of those responsibilities and discharge them very well.  I certainly agree with the Deputy that the cyclist on the road is a legitimate road user who should be conferred with the same respect as any other road user using any other type of vehicle.<br/><br/>There is no single measure which, alone, will work to ensure cyclists' safety.  However, the provision of cycle lanes and how we delineate space for cyclists on roads are still a major contribution to responding to some of the issues the Deputy raised.  The Road Safety Authority is engaged on an ongoing basis in promoting safe cycling.  This involves providing information and campaigning on issues such as the wearing of helmets and high visibility clothing, and campaigns designed to raise driver awareness of cyclists.  In that regard, its campaign includes a specific reference to drivers leaving a 1.5 m clearance when overtaking cyclists.  Campaigns include information in schools, booklets, advertising campaigns and engaging with cycling groups during the annual bike week.  Indeed, I met representatives of <i>cycling.ie</i>a number of weeks ago to discuss this and other matters with them.<br/><br/>I am familiar with the &quot;Stayin' Alive at 1.5&quot; campaign, which campaigns for the adoption of a law requiring motorists to give cyclists a minimum of 1.5 m clearance when passing from the rear.  Currently, the law states that a driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, if to do so would endanger or cause inconvenience to any other person.  Dangerous overtaking is an offence carrying a fixed charge penalty of &euro;80, with three penalty points on payment of a fixed charge and five on conviction in court.  The regulations do not specify overtaking distances in respect of any kind of vehicle, be it a car, pedal cycle, motorcycle or otherwise.  Depending on the circumstances, a motorist overtaking a cyclist in dangerous proximity or hitting a cyclist while overtaking could be charged with dangerous overtaking.<br/><br/>I am aware of the campaign referred to by the Deputy, as was my predecessor.  However, I am not convinced of the benefits of fixing a passing distance in law.  The reason is the difficulty of enforcing it if enshrined in primary legislation.  Such a law would only be enforceable in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na witnessed a car overtaking a cyclist at a dangerously close distance.  Even then, it would be difficult to prove the specific passing distance.<br/><br/>On foot of the Deputy raising this issue, I would be happy to meet the group with the Deputy to respond on the issue.  There are genuine difficulties in respect of implementing what the group is seeking, but given that the Deputy has raised the matter I will meet the group with her in the coming months to explain these challenges and to see if there are other ways to deal with this.</p></speech>

I am not denying that it would be difficult to pass a law because it would be difficult to police it.  However, we have the same situation, if not worse, with the current law.</p>  <p>  I am sorry to be personal about this, but the person I am discussing made the complaint to the Garda and was told that unless somebody saw that there were only inches between the cyclist and the bus, it was irrelevant.  The fact that the bus driver got out and made the cyclist feel more vulnerable is not breaking the law; it is just a bit of argy-bargy.  Until we define what is acceptable practice clearly in the law, so we can make people aware of acceptable practice and change their current practices, there will continue to be vulnerable cyclists on the road.</p>  <p>  The cycle lanes, greenways and anything we can do to encourage people to get more active, be it on the road or for pleasure, are wonderful.  I know the Minister truly supports that.  I will take him up on the offer of the meeting.  If the law we are currently seeking cannot be found to be enforceable, perhaps we will find some other mechanism to ensure that people are less vulnerable than they are today, which is the ultimate goal of Cycling Ireland and everybody who wishes people to be safe on the road from a cycling perspective.</p></speech>

It might not be in the immediate future, but we will meet in the coming months about this.</p>  <p>  My overall concern is the difficulty of enforcing a law which might well give a short-term benefit, because it would likely lead to a rise in awareness of the matter if such a law were to be implemented, but in the medium to long term that could be diluted by challenges in enforcing it.  The Deputy made the point that the Garda said it could not respond to the incident the Deputy described because it needed a witness or proof.  Unfortunately, that illustrates the type of difficulty we face when we seek to implement primary law.  Once something is enumerated in primary law, the burden of proof is high.  That is why there is a challenge with this matter, which we can discuss.</p>  <p>  The "Stayin' Alive at 1.5" campaign makes reference to a law which was implemented in Queensland from the middle of April 2014 for a two year period.  This puts in place a minimum distance of 1 m when passing cyclists in a 60 km/h or less speed zone and 1.5 m when the speed limit is over 60 km/h.  This law is the first of its kind in Australia and it might well be appropriate to look at the impact of that law and see what evidence it has yielded.  The Road Safety Authority has indicated that it will examine practice in this area in other countries.</p>  <p>  I see that Deputy Cannon is present and I am aware that he is very interested in this matter.  He has raised it with me previously.  Perhaps the meeting we have referred to is something we could approach together.  I have outlined the challenges that exist but with Deputy Doherty and Deputy Cannon we can engage with the group on the matter.</p></speech>

I will be brief as I am sharing time with Deputy Dooley.</p>  <p>  The Minister will be familiar with the outcome of yesterday's discussions between the transport unions, the Department, the National Transport Authority, CIE, Dublin Bus and so forth regarding the forthcoming proposal on the privatisation of 10% of routes.  The Minister's predecessor was also involved in this issue.  I hope the Minister will agree that it is regrettable that yesterday's discussions broke down because, one way or another, this issue must be resolved.  The bus workers have legitimate concerns about what might happen where 10% of routes are privatised, notwithstanding the fact that Dublin Bus, in the case of Dublin, can apply and will no doubt win some of those routes.  The point is that the worker is faced with the threat of a change of employer and issues about their pensions, pension rights and so forth.</p><p>There are other issues as well.  We should be concerned and avoid getting into the situation where these talks are now going.  SIPTU and the National Bus and Railworkers Union are in discussions about a ballot on strike action.  This is an opportunity for the Minister.  I know his views on public transport.  With the Minister's intervention we should get the talks started again.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that the National Transport Authority is pushing ahead with the privatisation agenda without the agreement of the unions concerned.  The NBRU has set out a clear position.  It has identified that section 52 of the 2008 Act gives exclusive rights to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate existing routes and, therefore, any privatisation can only be on new routes.</p>  <p>  It is highly regrettable that a representative body finds itself with no alternative but to resort to the protection of the courts to vindicate its rights.  It is particularly disturbing a time when the Labour Party forms part of the Government.  The Minister will recall that in the formation of the current Administration the Labour Party sought and achieved a Minister of State portfolio with responsibility for public transport.  Sadly, the Labour Party realised that it was losing the battle and allowed that post to be shelved when the then Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, was promoted to a full Cabinet position.  That was all done rather quietly but not without the recognition, in particular by the people who work in the public transport sector, that the Government had in effect turned its back on public transport workers.  This is especially disturbing with the Labour Party still at the Cabinet table.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister is a fair-minded individual and someone who has a balanced approach to all aspects of public transport.  He has not seemed to push the right-wing privatisation agenda of some in his party.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to the NTA, ask it to postpone its agenda of putting routes out to tender and try to get consensus among the worker representatives.  It would be appalling if a representative body had to seek redress in the courts while the Labour Party forms part of the Government.</p></speech>

Since this is such an important matter I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the D&aacute;il.  It is disappointing that unions have withdrawn from discussions being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  I understand the discussions had been progressing with several employee concerns being addressed.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority has the statutory responsibility under legislation for judging how best to balance direct award and tendered public service obligation bus services.  The NTA decided in late 2013 that 10% of the existing PSO bus market should be tendered following a wide-ranging consultation process.  The NTA was proceeding with the public procurement process while participating in an LRC-facilitated process to address CIE employee concerns on the implications of this market opening.  The talks have been adjourned following the threat of litigation by the NBRU and trade union withdrawal yesterday.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that there has been intensive engagement for some time on employee issues.  It is the Government view that these LRC discussions would allow employee concerns to be addressed satisfactorily.  Indeed, there has been a particular focus on facilitating existing employees to remain in either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann if either company did not succeed in the tendering process.  I understand that strenuous efforts were being made within the talks process to facilitate as many existing employees as possible to stay in their respective companies, arising from forecast growth in the PSO market under the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann direct award contracts.</p>  <p>  The introduction of competitive tendering has the potential to save taxpayers' money, encourage cost competitiveness and enhance service quality.  The international experience indicates that competitive tendering is beneficial in providing subsidised PSO bus services or socially necessary non-commercial bus services.</p>  <p>  This year, 2015, for the first time since 2008, the level of PSO contribution for bus and rail services is being maintained at the same level as the previous year.  Moreover, I secured &euro;110 million for public transport as part of the 2014 Supplementary Estimate.  Improved public transport, whether new services or increased frequencies of existing services, will require additional funding.  Our support for improved services should be given in conjunction with an appropriate degree of competitive tension within the market in the interests of quality and cost-effectiveness for commuters.  This is why I am committed to the 10% tendering of bus routes.</p>  <p>  I recognise, however, that trade unions have concerns about the impact of our existing legislation post-2019 when the direct award contracts granted to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are due to expire.  I am advised that the legislation, which was enacted by the previous Government, was carefully crafted in accordance with EU law.  This legislation has recently allowed the NTA to renew the direct award contracts of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus subject to arrangements being made for the tendering of 10% of the PSO bus market.  However, in light of trade union concerns, my Department has recently agreed to seek legal advice on specific aspects of the compatibility of our legislation, in particular with regard to the post-2019 scenario, with the provisions of EU law.  Despite this agreement, the NBRU decided to withdraw from the talks yesterday.</p>  <p>  The NTA is satisfied that it has the necessary powers under existing legislation to continue with the tendering process and will defend any threatened litigation by NBRU as necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100035#HH00400"><p>Notwithstanding what the Minister said at the end about the process going ahead, my principal concern having spoken to the various trade union representatives is that we are allowing or could allow a situation to evolve in which we will have an unnecessary strike or a cessation of Dublin bus services over something that is avoidable.  Anyone with knowledge of industrial relations would understand that unless the parties concerned are talking to each other, there will not be progress.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that this process has gone on for some time, although not for too long in the overall context.  It is part of the European process.  Notwithstanding that, for the National Transport Authority to state casually that it is going ahead with the tendering process is, in layman's terms, like a red rag to a bull.  We can understand the reaction from workers and their unions.  They see a situation in which they are going to be forced into a position where they have to make a stand.  That should be avoided.  That is my principal case to the Minister.  That should not be allowed to unfold.  Sometimes strikes happen by default.  No worker wants to go on strike; they are not always beneficial.  No one should be put in that situation.  A strike is always a last resort for people in trade unions.  Again, I urge the Minister to do whatever he possibly can.</p>  <p>  I have taken note of Deputy Dooley's contribution.  He spent most of his two minutes talking about privatisation and the Labour Party.  His memory is short.  He should consider Aer Lingus as well as what he and Fianna F&aacute;il did to the subsidy to Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, etc.  He should check some facts before he contributes to Topical Issue debates.</p></speech>

It appears we are heading towards a scenario where the workers' representatives are seeking the protection of the courts while the Labour Party remains in government.</p><p>I am somewhat confused that the Labour Party is not doing more at Government level to support public transport.  I am also concerned at the serious impact industrial action will have on the travelling public.  It is incumbent on the Minister to address the concerns of the workers, which in essence will be addressing the potential concerns of the travelling public.  The NTA needs to move back.  Asserting its legal position at this stage is unhelpful.  This can still be done around the table.  Of course, I recognise the supremacy of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court in attempting to find an appropriate solution.  It is unhelpful that there will not be an opportunity to allow that to be dealt with in a calm and collected way.  We have to try to pull back from the courts and the NTA has to pull back from its procurement process and try to find a solution that meets the needs and concerns of all at this time.</p></speech>

I am the Minister who, before Christmas, brought in a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;110 million, the sole purpose of which was to support the development of the CIE group and meet its financial needs.  I did that because I recognise the very important role public transport has to play in responding to and meeting the needs of passengers, in many cases where the private sector will not do so or is not in a position to do so.  That is why our public transport companies, particularly our bus companies, are important, and it is one of the reasons they received such support from me before Christmas.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Labour Relations Commission, I reiterate that what happened yesterday is disappointing.  Many of the issues that have been raised by the unions as being important and which they raised with me before Christmas would have been resolved within the labour relations process.  There are key issues in regard to the impact on workers and the future of the bus market.  I am confident that if the process had been allowed to continue, these matters would have been dealt with and, therefore, what happened yesterday is disappointing.  I reaffirm that the Labour Relations Commission, the supremacy of which Deputy Dooley acknowledged, is the forum in which matters like this should be dealt with.  I am confident the legislation that is in place is robust.

I ask the Minister to please understand the enormous stress this family are under because of what has happened to their brother and son.</p><p>Ibrahim has been jailed in Egypt since August 2013 for participating in a peaceful protest.  He is recognised by Amnesty International and Reprieve, two major NGOs, as a prisoner of conscience and they also fear his life is in danger.  Let us be clear about the nature of the Egyptian regime in 2015.  It is a vicious military dictatorship which is trying to reassert control after the Arab Spring revolution that has been taking place, which routinely mass-sentences hundreds to their deaths after sham trials and which represses not just the Muslim Brotherhood but also others, for example, a female socialist was shot in the street in recent weeks for participating in a peaceful protest.  It crushes all opposition.</p><p>We and the family are asking not just the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, but at this stage the Taoiseach himself to intervene in this case.  Given the situation Egypt, this should not be just Minister to Minister.  The Taoiseach needs to intervene with the Prime Minister and the President to demonstrate beyond any doubt that the Irish Government is doing its utmost to get released an Irish citizen in a foreign prison.</p><p>I do not know how many Irish people are in foreign prisons at the moment but I certainly do not think sufficient of what needs to be done is being done by the Government.  A man's life is in danger.  Ibrahim has been tortured, whipped, electrocuted and shot in the hand.  The stress on his mother is enormous.  She has had to move to Egypt to visit him, and she was eventually allowed to see him on Saturday.  He has been moved to the prison of Wadi al-Natrun, which is a notorious torture chamber.  He said to her on Saturday: &quot;Mum, take me out of here, they are killing me here&quot;.  I cannot emphasise enough that if the Government does not intervene at the highest level, we could have a tragedy on our hands.</p><p>What I am asking the Minister to do is this.  So far, it would seem the Minister has been making representations to the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Shoukry, and he has done this three times, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  The Irish ambassador in Cairo has also taken an interest in the case.  All that is not disputed.  However, what has been asked by the Minister is for a review of Ibrahim's case or for him to be given a fair and separate trial.  There is no fair and separate trial possible in this situation.  It is a mass trial of 500.  They will not take out one person and give him a fair trial.  We need the Irish Government to recognise he should not be in jail because he does not have any case to answer, as has been well-investigated and documented.</p><p>What is being done is not working.  This is a dictatorship, not a normal Government.  One month ago, a presidential decree was submitted by lawyers for Ibrahim but, one month on, nothing has happened.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, report back to us?  The Taoiseach himself has to act on this presidential decree because that is the only way it will move from the prosecutor's office to the Prime Minister's office.  It will only be done if there is a push and pressure at the highest level.  This is how Peter Greste, the Australian who shared a cell with Ibrahim, was released.  This is how the Canadians and the Turkish have had their citizens released.</p><p>I would finish by raising a question mark.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is responsible for the diaspora abroad.  Are there two tiers of citizenship in this country?  We have given citizenship to many people.  Ibrahim was born, bred and educated here.  He has played GAA, in which the Minister of State has an interest.  He is as Irish as anyone else.  Are we serious about the new Irish or do we just think that Irish people are homogenous and only white and Catholic?  That is a very serious issue.  The family feel, and I certainly feel, that if his name was Paddy or Mick and if he was white, a lot more would have been done.  I ask the Minister of State to put aside any concerns about the beef trade or any other concerns he has about the Egyptians and to please get the Taoiseach to intervene.</p></speech>

I also welcome the sisters of Ibrahim to the Visitors Gallery.  If I get an opportunity, I will speak to them afterwards.</p>  <p>  I am replying to this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Any suggestion that the Minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are failing to act because of Ibrahim Halawa's name or because of his Egyptian heritage is unfair and unfounded, and is completely contradicted by the record of actions to date in this case.  Such suggestions are utterly untrue and entirely without foundation, and I would like to put that on the record of the House before taking this opportunity to update the House more generally.</p><p> The postponed preliminary hearing of the case involving Ibrahim Halawa took place in Cairo on Sunday, 29 March.  Officials from Ireland's embassy attended, including our ambassador Ms Isolde Moylan.  This hearing was different from previous postponed hearings.  All the defendants were present and the judge indicated that he would accept oral or written submissions from the lawyers present on behalf of their clients.</p> <p> Ibrahim Halawa's lawyers formally presented an application for his release on bail and specifically referred to his youth, student status and Irish nationality.  Among the documents submitted was a formal diplomatic note from the embassy confirming the support of the Government for the application and other documents supporting the application that had been sourced with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The fact that the Irish ambassador was present in the court was noted.  The trial was then adjourned until 26 April to allow for consideration of the petitions made.</p> <p> I was genuinely horrified over the weekend to hear the reports in the media that Ibrahim Halawa was being tortured.  The welfare of an Irish citizen imprisoned abroad is a matter taken extremely seriously by the Government and immediate action was taken by the consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy in Cairo.  The ambassador, Ms Moylan, made an urgent consular visit to Ibrahim Halawa yesterday.  She met prison officials and had a visit during which Ibrahim Halawa was able to talk to her freely.</p> <p> While imprisonment abroad is traumatic for any young Irish citizen, based on the facts established by the ambassador through direct contact with the citizen, the reports of torture were discovered to be unfounded, nor had he been housed in a death penalty cell as had been suggested in some reports over the weekend.  Unfortunately, these inaccurate reports may also have been damaging to our ongoing efforts in this case as they attributed to the Egyptian authorities a level of maltreatment and abuse that is not accurate.</p> <p> Where Irish citizens are charged with offences abroad, it is the foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  Just as politicians here cannot interfere with legal cases ongoing before the Irish courts, Ireland cannot directly interfere in cases before foreign courts.  Given that a petition for release is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, the Government does not intend to make further extensive comments on this case at this time.  I encourage all Deputies to be similarly judicious in their comments.  However, we continue to give all appropriate support to Ibrahim Halawa, as we would to any Irish citizen in his situation.</p></speech>

Does the Government recognise that there cannot be a fair trial in Egypt at the moment?  I ask the Minister of State to address that in his supplementary reply.  If the Government believes there is any possibility of a fair trial, which is suggested in the response, that would be very dangerous.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Minister of State's claim that reports of torture were unfounded, we have to take what Ibrahim and his mother, who has visited him, have said.  I do not know why the Minister of State is making that claim but he has said it in the Official Report, and therefore it is quite serious.  The Reprieve organisation in Britain, which follows up the cases of prisoners, said that Wadi el-Natrun is known as the torture prison in Egypt by activists and prisoners.  Many deaths have occurred as a result of people being in it.  Amnesty International, which is well-respected, has said his life is in danger.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is suggesting that there is an over-the-top reaction.  This young boy was 17 years of age, a child in legal terms in our country.  In case there is any suspicion of anything, for people from Egypt to go back there to visit and then participate in a protest is absolutely and utterly natural.  It would be like people from Ireland returning to Ireland and going on a water charges protest or any other political development which was taking place in a country.</p>  <p>  There is no proof or suggestion anywhere that there was any wrongdoing or violence involved.  Therefore, he should not be in prison.  Will the Minister of State ensure the presidential decree that was submitted and used to get the release of other high-profile prisoners of other nationalities is obtained?  Other governments got it via this route.  Why is the Irish Government taking a different route?</p></speech>

I would ask Deputies to keep in mind that, however well-meant, injudicious or intemperate statements made or actions taken here in Ireland may have a negative impact on Ibrahim's plight.  Rather than assisting the situation, such action may in fact be contrary to his best interests.  Unfounded reports of torture and unfounded allegations of bias against the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are doing nothing positive for this case.</p>  <p>  The key consideration for the officials working on this case at all times has been and will continue to be to ensure the action taken is in Ibrahim Halawa's best interests.  I would also like to acknowledge that this is a very difficult time for the Halawa family, as it would be for any family in these circumstances.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is keeping them fully informed of developments and will continue to work co-operatively with them to make positive progress towards our shared goal, which is Ibrahim's return.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of various calls for additional action by the Government.  We keep all aspects of this case, including the Department's approach, under review.  At all times, the key consideration for the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Department has been, and will continue to be, to ensure action taken is in the citizen's best interests.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100037#KK00800"><p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>In page 5, after line 30, to insert the following:&ldquo;(a) property which has experienced a change in circumstances which has significantly affected its net value,&rdquo;.</blockquote>I welcome the opportunity to move this amendment.  It is a small amendment.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle indicated that all amendments being discussed today were discussed on Committee Stage, so we do not need to have as detailed a discussion on the amendments, except perhaps for one or two of them.  This amendment was discussed at length on Committee Stage.</p><p>The essence of the point I am making is that in the case of a change in circumstances which significantly affects the annual value, this should be taken into account rather than just physical alterations to buildings.  We are all familiar with areas which have declined in terms of trade because a new shopping centre has opened nearby.  The level of business in a location may have diminished.  We all know of examples where a village or filling station has been bypassed by a motorway and the level of business has reduced accordingly.  Notwithstanding the fact there is no change to the physical building, there can be a real change to the net annual value which should be taken into account by the Valuation Office.</p></speech>

We had extensive engagement on many of these issues on Committee Stage and I look forward to further discussion now.  I am afraid I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  The material change of circumstance provisions have been criticised as being too restrictive and I agree with Deputy Fleming that there are limited circumstances where a material change of circumstances has not occurred, yet a ratepayer is suffering a significant inequity.</p>  <p>  A classic case quoted by the Deputy and one I have quoted is the bypassed service station.  In response, a new discretion is included in the Bill to deal with cases of exceptional inequity which need to be addressed even when there is no material change of circumstances.  This new discretion, together with a rolling revaluation, is the answer.  Many of the difficulties that have been experienced by businesses have been the result of a lack of regular revaluation.  Moving to a regular rolling revaluation is the answer.  This is where we are heading.  We are making progress and this Bill will help to add to that.</p>  <p>  As is the case for every other Member of the House, I would prefer to get there quicker, but I do not favour the alternative which is a break with the model which means we will never achieve rolling revaluation and could potentially have chaos instead.</p><p> As the Deputy indicated, the amendment was discussed on Committee Stage.  I know the Deputy is aware that changes to the physical circumstances of the properties are taken into account when deciding if a material change of circumstances has occurred.  The Bill as passed by the Seanad includes an additional circumstance where a property either becomes licensed or ceases to be licensed under the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011.</p> <p> I understand the Deputy's intention is to widen the material change of circumstances in order that the valuation of a property can be altered between revaluations to take account of economic factors.  This would undermine a fundamental tenet of the rating system as it currently applies to both the revaluation of entire local authorities and the revision of valuation of individual properties.  It could mean, for example, that properties in Dublin city which were recently revalued by reference to the difficult market conditions and rental levels prevailing on 7 April 2011 would now have their valuations revised and perhaps increased because of general improvements in Dublin's rental levels that have taken place in the meantime.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to do but for the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is that the commissioner shall within two months of making the application referred to in section 27 &quot;appoint an officer of the Commissioner to exercise, in relation to the property or properties to which the application relates, the powers expressed by this section to be exercisable by a revision manager, and such manager who is so appointed is also referred to in this Act as a 'revision manager'.&quot;</p><p>Amendment No. 3 would substitute &quot;within 6 months&quot; with &quot;within 4 months&quot;.  This means the subsection would begin, &quot;A revision manager shall, if the property concerned is property that has been the subject of an application under section 27, within 4 months from the date of his or her appointment under subsection (3) in respect of that application&quot;.  Essentially, in both cases, I am trying shorten the timeline involved.  In the first case it is to two months and in the second case, the six-month period would be shortened to four months.</p></speech>

I undertook on Committee Stage to propose an amendment on Report Stage that will achieve what the Deputy intends.  As the Deputy pointed out, there is a weakness in the current legislation and in what is proposed in the Bill as it stands.  A revision case must be concluded within six months of its assignment to a revision manager but there is no limit on the period within which a revision case is to be assigned to that manager.</p>  <p>  In the amendments I propose, I take some practical considerations into account.  I am not breaking the six-month period into two months and four months, as a period of 40 days must be allowed for representations.  If the representation period had to be taken from the four-month period, the Deputy would appreciate that it would leave very little time for the work of the valuer on the revision case.  I am also stipulating that the six-month period starts from the receipt of a valid application, accompanied by the prescribed fee, etc.  The clock should not run if the application is flawed in some way.</p>  <p>  Additionally, I am providing that this new six-month deadline can be commenced separately from the rest of the Bill.  This is just a practical measure to allow the Valuation Office to bring all current revision cases up to date in the interim and make the necessary operational changes to be in a position to implement this provision on an ongoing basis.  The Deputy will accept there will be a number of changes that the Valuation Office will have to put in place as a result of the passage of this legislation.  Deputy Fleming's proposals are sensible and we should take the spirit of them through amendments Nos. 4 and 11.</p></speech>

Currently, there is no provision in the Bill to provide for time limits within which the commissioner must exercise powers under section 29A.  To ensure the proper functioning of this section, I have proposed a time limit.  With regard to the second half of the amendment, there is again no provision for a time limit within which the revision manager must comply with the commissioner's directive made under section 29A.  To ensure the proper functioning of the legislation, we should have a second time limit included in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-31a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100038#LL01200"><p>This amendment is at odds with the intention of section 15 which provides discretionary powers to the commissioner in exceptional circumstances in the interests of fair, equitable and uniform valuation lists.  The first proposed amendment would result in limiting the discretion by limiting the period within which the function could be exercised.  This could inadvertently be very unfavourable to ratepayers.  If there is a concern that the new discretion will not be used, I recall stating in my closing comments on Second Stage in the House that the commissioner very much welcomed the new discretion.  As the holder of that office, he has an overriding concern in ensuring the valuation list is equitable and uniform, and this new discretion will not be low on his list of priorities.  It would be very much regretted by a ratepayer if an anomaly that could be corrected but was not acted upon in the two-month period envisaged by this amendment found himself or herself back in a previous position.  I know that is not Deputy Fleming's intention but it could be an inadvertent outcome of the acceptance of this amendment.</p>  <p>  The second part of the amendment is also problematic.  Where the commissioner exercises the discretionary power, it is essential that it is exercised according to the timelines and other existing provisions in section 28 of the 2001 Act, as amended, including 40 days to make representations to the revision manager.  Ample time must be provided to research the case details and the applicable grounds, which may include a physical inspection of the property.  An adequate period in which to consider representations made must also be allowed.  Taking more than 40 days from a two-month period leaves no time for the work of the valuer, which again would cause difficulties.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

This deals with what is commonly known in the business as the &quot;tone&quot; of the list.  It broadens the issue with respect to the annual value of property and it deals with other properties in the same rating authority.  Under this, I will refer to the point we also raised on Committee Stage with regard to the Irish Wind Energy Association.  Since Committee Stage I am sure its representatives have contacted the Minister of State's office, the Valuation Office and others.  They gave me a presentation earlier today, because time has been very tight, and informed me that wind energy contributes &euro;1.9 million in rates in County Donegal, which is approximately one third of Donegal's rates take.  This seems extraordinary, and I would like to know how it gels with the tone of the list relative to other businesses.  I am told that wind energy contributes up to &euro;3 million in rates in County Cork.  On Committee Stage, we quoted the exact examples of cases in County Limerick in which people's revaluations have resulted in a 280% increase in their rates bills.</p><p> I have told the Irish Wind Energy Association that I will ask the Minister to consider delaying the finalisation of the legislation to allow time for these and other relevant matters.  The legislation was published in 2012 and there have been delays along the way to allow submissions to be considered.  Given that the new valuations and rates bills arrived in Limerick only last year, long after the Bill commenced its passage through the House, people were unaware of the industry and the issue has come up late in the day.  I am upfront and have told IWEA that I am not a fan of some of its members and what they have tried to do in the midlands in particular.  That said, its point that this is undermining the financial model of the industry is valid.  Some of the companies are in receipt of a public service obligation levy which is meant to be a contribution to the industry.  However, if the rates increase at the rate they have done in Limerick, the value of the PSO levy will be negated.  It makes no sense for the State to give a levy to an industry on the one hand and to take it back through rates.  When we discuss a rateable area in a local authority, this is a valid area to raise.</p></speech>

Given that the overriding principle of rates is the occupation of the physical structure being valued, not the economic buoyancy or otherwise of the business carried out in it, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  However, I am pleased he has raised the issue of wind energy, given that on Committee Stage I made a commitment to revert to it on Report Stage, and I welcome the opportunity to do so.</p>  <p>  The large increase in rates for wind farms, arising from the revaluation of all commercial property in Limerick, and the implications of this level of increase for the wind energy sector, were discussed on Committee Stage.  While I accept the wind energy sector is not seeking a complete exemption from rates, it was hoping to propose amendments to the Bill.  There were no related amendments on Committee Stage and there are none on Report Stage.  However, I undertook to consider this and my officials have engaged with interested stakeholders on the issue.  The points I made during the debate on Committee Stage still hold true and, for the benefit of the House, I will summarise what I said.</p>  <p>  Like all revaluations, the Limerick revaluation redistributed the rates burden based on contemporary property values.  A revaluation can cause significant shifts in rates liabilities between different sectors, particularly where a considerable period has elapsed since the last exercise.  We want this process to ensure more regular revaluations.  From experience of revaluations to date, up to 65% of ratepayers can experience a reduction in their rates.  Given that the total revenue from rates is capped after a revaluation, the reductions enjoyed by the 65% will result in increases for the other 35%.  The Limerick revaluation has led to large increases in the valuations of wind farms which will, subject to appeal, see their rates rise in some cases by 200%.</p>  <p>  The increases experienced by wind farms as a category of rateable property are on the higher end of the scale across the board.  In recent revaluations, some individual properties in certain categories have also experienced very significant rate increases.  Limerick is the first revalued rating authority with a significant number of wind farms.  The ten Limerick wind farms which have recently been revalued are modern, have large generating capacities and date from approximately 2008 onwards.  They comprise some of the latest technology in a rapidly developing area.  This contrasts with the position heretofore.  The first wind farm valued by the Valuation Office for the purposes of rating was developed in the early 1990s in County Mayo.  The valuation assessed on this first wind farm set the basis for valuing all other wind farms that subsequently came on stream, including the Limerick wind farms before they were revalued.</p>  <p>  All the wind farms were valued under the revision provisions of the current legislation.  This reflected the state of wind energy technology in the early 1990s and the financial and economic conditions that prevailed in Ireland in the late 1980s.  The valuations now assessed on the wind farms in Limerick, like all other rateable properties in Limerick, reflect the economic conditions which prevailed in late 2012.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his function and the Valuation Act does not accord the Minister any function in the valuation of a property or an appeal.  However, the legislation provides for a number of avenues of appeal.  There is an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  It is important to allow for the independent process of valuation and appeal to take its course without knee-jerk policy reactions before it concludes.</p>  <p>  Although I hear the Deputy's point on the potential delaying of the Bill, I do not accept it.  I am not saying the sector does not have an issue, and I acknowledge its willingness to pay rates, even increased rates.  However, the situation and the impact on the sector cannot be fully analysed until the results of the appeals process have been concluded.  Delaying the Bill to allow a full analysis of the impact of current legislation, not the impact of the Bill, on one sector is not an option.  The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures to accelerate the revaluation programme throughout the country.  It would not be fair to ask ratepayers in counties that have yet to be revalued to delay the introduction of measures to accelerate the revaluation process while we consider at length the implications of the current legislation on one sector.  However, a decision not to delay the Bill does not mean, nor should it be interpreted as, closing the door on a partial exemption.  If, after full consideration of the facts, we decide that this is the best route to take, another legislative vehicle can be found to introduce a change to the Valuation Act 2001, if this is what is most appropriate.</p>  <p>  We should allow the appeals process to take its course.  A number of appeals are under active consideration.  Let us see what arises from them and fully assess the impact.  If there is a need for a policy change, let us consider it.  As Minister with responsibility for the legislation, I need the revaluation process to get under way.  The Deputy has rightly made the point that it is going too slowly.  Ratepayers have a right to have appropriate valuations attached to their properties that reflect modern reality.  A number of people would benefit from the Bill, including local sports clubs and elements of the child care sector.  I want to push on with the Bill.  I am not closing the door to a partial exemption and we will allow the appeals process to run its course and see where we stand from a policy point of view.</p></speech>

All buildings and facilities used in connection with water and wastewater owned by Irish Water.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote>This amendment would require all buildings and facilities using connections with water and wastewater services owned by Irish Water to be included in the Act in order that Irish Water would pay commercial rates and be subject to valuation, like any other semi-State body.  I proposed a similar amendment on Committee Stage and I spoke about public versus private ownership, group schemes and impacts.  In this amendment, I have been more specific and have homed in on Irish Water.  The Water Services Act 2014 amended the Valuation Act 2001 to allow approximately &euro;59 million to be paid in lieu of commercial rates by the Department.  This is State aid by the taxpayer through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If Irish Water is a legitimate, stand-alone, commercial semi-State body, like Bus &Eacute;ireann, CIE, the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is, it should pay rates like every other body and should not have them paid by the taxpayer through the back door.  The legislation provides State aid, and it should not happen.  I am against Irish Water to start with, and it is a further insult to the people to ask them to pay the rates bill of Irish Water, a body with which people are not happy.  The principle I am establishing here is very clear.  I am opposed to special treatment for Irish Water.</p></speech>

If the intention of Deputy Fleming's amendment is to make Irish Water rateable, I am advised that it would not succeed in doing so, even if passed.  Schedule 3 sets out classes of property that are regarded as relevant property for the purposes of valuation.  Schedule 3 describes property in very general terms and includes all types of buildings, mines, networks, rights to drill for petroleum, tolls, advertising stations and so on.  All rateable property is described at a high level in just two pages in Schedule 3.  Given that Schedule 3 does not need specific references to owners or occupiers such as Irish Water, the amendment would duplicate what is already provided for.  Irish Water's property, be it buildings, land or networks, is already captured in Schedule 3.  The amendment proposed would not make Irish Water rateable.  Exemptions for the rates are provided for in Schedule 4 and the exemption from rates for Irish Water is provided for in subsection 21 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as inserted by section 12 of the Water Services Act 2014, as the Deputy said.  The reasons for making this exemption have been well-rehearsed and were fully debated when the Water Services Act 2014 was making its way through the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
