    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200003#A00200"><p>At the weekend, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, in particular, reported leaks from the recommendations of the trauma steering group that was established by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, last year.  It essentially identified nine accident and emergency departments that are under threat of being downgraded, being open for shorter periods or closure of some kind and the removal of trauma facilities from them.  Obviously, this has caused concern across the country, including in Cavan, Naas, at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, Mullingar, at St. Luke's in Kilkenny, Clonmel, at Mercy Hospital in Cork and Portlaoise.  At all emergency departments across the country there is incredible overcrowding.  Even today, more than 400 people are on trolleys.  There was a time when the rows were about whether there would be an emergency department in a county.  Based on this report, there will be regions without emergency departments if this trend continues.  In the east, there is the potential for nothing in between Waterford and Dublin, with Kilkenny and Wexford taken out.  In the midlands, there will be nothing between Tullamore and Tallaght in Dublin.  The problem is that emergency departments in Dublin simply cannot cope and are bursting at the seams.  In Cork, there have been closures in the South Infirmary, Mallow and Bantry down through the years.</p><p>The point I am making is that there has been significant reconfiguration already.  Some medics will say that politicians will oppose this and oppose that.</p><p>There needs to be a re-evaluation of all of this, and of the trend, because by the time we are finished everybody will be going to Dublin for an emergency facility or a department.  While there must be professional medical input, there must also be balance, common sense and an evaluation of what has happened already because there is incredible overcrowding.  Last year, I visited Galway University Hospital, where there is an appalling vista.  As it has just two cubicles for paediatric patients, it is completely incapable of dealing with what it has already been asked to deal with as part of the reconfiguration along the western seaboard, with the hospital in Letterkenny in Donegal having to shift people down to Galway University Hospital, which simply cannot cope.  The major refurbishment it requires is not even in the capital programme that runs up to 2021.  It cannot possibly cope.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200004#B00300"><p>I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the bottom line is that there needs to be a fundamental rethink of where we are going.  Common sense and a bit of balance need to be brought into this equation in terms of best outcomes because best outcomes also mean morbidity and fatality because of overcrowding itself.  Doctors have estimated that people are dying because of overcrowding in our emergency hospitals.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm when the steering group report will be published?  Will she confirm that the leaks are accurate?  I refer to what has been revealed so far.  Will she confirm that the accident and emergency departments in question will not be downgraded or affected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200004#B00400"><p>It is important to reassure people that the work which is under way to develop a national trauma policy is about getting the best outcomes for a particular small category of patients who sustain traumatic injuries.  The Minister has not yet received that report.  It is probable that he will not get it until towards the end of the year.  There is no question of closing accident and emergency departments.</p>  <p>  I will respond to the broader points made by the Deputy.  Attendances in our health service have increased by 6%.  For example, the number of elective procedures done this year has increased by 13,500 when compared with last year.  The Government has just invested &euro;500 million, or 90% of available resources, in our health services to deal with the pressures outlined by the Deputy.  There is no question of focusing emergency care in Dublin.  Clearly, we are establishing the hospital groups to ensure appropriate care is provided throughout the country.  As the Deputy knows, there are very large demands on our health services.  That is why an additional &euro;500 million has been invested this year.  Some &euro;15 million has been allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to deal with those who have been on the waiting lists for the longest period of time.  All of those initiatives are targeted at dealing with and improving our waiting lists and making sure people get these services.  The throughput in our health services is up.  Attendances are up 6%.</p>  <p>  The Government is responding to the high demand that exists by investing further and making sure we have the appropriate services around the country.  The hospital groups have been given responsibility for developing local services.  I repeat that there is no intention to close down accident and emergency departments.  That is not the Minister's intention.  This is about trauma care.  It is a question of how to get those who suffer traumatic injuries in road accidents to the best centre in the appropriate place.  The Royal College of Surgeons has been working on that and has made a recommendation.  The Minister has agreed that this area should be examined to give the very best care to people who have suffered traumatic injuries.</p></speech>

I asked about the waiting lists last week and they have got far worse since then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200004#B00600"><p>Not since last week.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has said that accident and emergency departments might not be closed down but I believe it is possible that there could be a dramatic change in the nature of what happens in them.  The point I am making to the T&aacute;naiste is that there has been no re-evaluation of the trend, or the model that is being driven incessantly by the medics.  There has been no evaluation of what has actually happened.  That is my point.  The tertiary centres cannot cope.  When will someone cop on to the huge problems that have arisen since we centralised everything?  I have been in the key tertiary models.  There is no way they can cope with report after report without a proper overarching model being put in place.  It needs intervention.  I expect that the Minister is well briefed on this.  He is nodding his head.  I know he has not got the report formally but he will have been briefed on this by his officials.</p></speech>

That is what happens normally.  The bottom line is that somebody here must push back.  Tallaght hospital will not be able to take everything; the hospital in Galway cannot cope with what it has to deal with, not to mind close down another facility, while Cork University Hospital cannot take any more, given the numbers who are attending.  There is now talk of having one for the entire county and city.  It is just not doable.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept the need for new thinking, to balance what medical personnel are bringing to the table with other studies and analyses of what has happened so far?  Let us take the example of what is happening in Limerick and Ennis.  Politicians went along with it-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200005#C00400"><p>The Deputy is a former Minister for Health and knows that we must examine how trauma patients can best be dealt with.  That is what the study is about.  It is important not to raise unnecessary anxiety.  I have outlined the position in emergency departments.  It is not about closing them or diminishing services.  Currently, there are no plans to close or remove trauma services from hospitals.  However, it is extremely important to examine this very small percentage of patients, obtain the report and discuss in a rational way the best way to deal with people suffering from a particular type of trauma and where is the best place to bring a person with, for example, a head injury after a car accident.  It might not be the nearest emergency department but a specialist trauma centre.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200005#C00500"><p>I know that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200005#C00600"><p>That is what we are talking about; that is what the Deputy raised.  He then proceeded to talk about the possible closure of other departments, which is not on the agenda, as I have repeatedly said.  What is on the agenda is a discussion about the best care to be provided.  The report has not yet been received by the Minister.  When it is, it will be considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200005#C00700"><p>On the same matter raised by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, it is incredible that members of the Government have managed to avoid much of the commentary on and discussion about the report of the trauma steering group.  I will outline what it contains.  In short, it proposes the redirecting of trauma patients to the supposed centres of excellence.  However, we have seen all of this previously, with the scaling back of services in Nenagh, Ennis and the mid-west, the reduction in services in Roscommon and Tipperary and the concentration of services in Clonmel, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in the north east, St. Vincent's University Hospital and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  We do not need a commission report to know that these measures have utterly failed.  The recommendations made in the report pertain to both serious and moderate trauma cases.  That is the difference.  Previously, patients with serious trauma injuries were sent to so-called centres of excellence, but now they will receive both serious and moderate trauma cases.  This will mean that the scale of downgrading will be even greater and it will put pressure on hospitals that are already at breaking point.  It means that many more people will be affected and that there will be more overcrowding and chaos in already over-worked emergency departments.</p>  <p>  I was a member of the accident and emergency forum for many years and have seen at first hand the impact reports such as this have.  The T&aacute;naiste has made the point that it is important not to cause panic.  However, that is exactly what will happen.  People driving past their local hospitals tonight on their way home from work will wonder if their hospital will survive the Government's term of office.  That is what is on their minds.  The Minister says he has not seen the report and claims not to have been briefed on it.  That is utterly incredible.  There were senior members of the Department of Health involved in the production of the report and it is incredible that they would not have seen fit to provide a briefing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200005#C00900"><p>There is an all-party committee on the future of health care.  There is substantial evidence that the report will be material to the work of that committee.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure every report that is vital to the business of that committee will be laid before it?  Otherwise, what will happen is that it will report and immediately afterwards another report will issue.</p><p>Given that we are reading about this in the press, we do not know how many reports will inform the work of this vital committee.</p></speech>

However, we cannot work in a vacuum and it is unfair to expect that we will.  Will the T&aacute;naiste insist that any and all available reports, including those in draft form, are laid before the committee?</p></speech>

The Minister has not received a report, so the Deputy is operating on the basis of a report in regard to the committee's work, which is not finished.  Of course, it will go to the all-party committee on health for discussion when it is available.  The Minister has been very keen to show that he wants to work comprehensively with the committee and this is clearly a report that will go there.  It is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE.  As I have already said to Deputy Martin, it has been developed in recognition of the fact we do not have a co-ordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  This is about doing the best for patients-----</p></speech>

I would also put on the record of the House that the current fragmented arrangements for dealing with trauma in hospitals in Ireland have long been a point of discussion, and trauma services are one of those service areas that require a national policy direction.  That is what is being worked on at present.  To say anything else, or to say that emergency departments are now under threat because we are discussing how best to deal with patients who suffer traumatic injuries, is incorrect.</p></speech>

While I respect what the T&aacute;naiste has said, it might be that she and her colleagues have given over their weekend to speculating about internal party matters.  Perhaps if she had been talking to people who are concerned about this, she would know that the concerns that are being raised are not raised in order to frighten people unnecessarily but because they are being raised directly with us.  People know the record of this Government.  They know it will lead with cuts, they know that it will cut first and ask questions later, and they are concerned.</p>  <p>  I asked the T&aacute;naiste to give a commitment that any and all information, be it in draft form or otherwise, be given to the committee, of which I and others in the Chamber are members, so we might have all of the information in order to make up our minds and issue our own reports.  She has not given that commitment and I want to press her on that.

What I can give the Deputy a reassurance about, of course, is that once the report is available, the Minister will make it available to the health committee.  It should rightly form part of the discussions at the health committee.  In the meantime, as I said, there is no threat to emergency departments.  In fact, what the Government is doing is investing in the health service, with 90% of the resources that were available going into the health services to deal with the ever-increasing demands on the services.  Recently, &euro;500 million was allocated to deal with the issues we are concerned with here.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this report is to ensure we do the best for patients who suffer traumatic injuries and make sure they go to the right place, where they will get the best health care.  It is not about closing or changing the arrangements in regard to emergency departments.</p></speech>

A very simple sentence is required, that no accident and emergency department will be in any way adversely affected by anything that arises from the report.  That is what is needed.</p>  <p>  I want to raise another matter, if I can.  The HSE funds 1,900 voluntary agencies to a value of approximately &euro;3.1 billion per year.  A total of 44 of these agencies, which account for annual expenditure of &euro;2.5 billion, are funded under section 38 of the Health Act.  The remaining approximately 1,800 are part funded under section 39 of the same Act.  The governance context in which the HSE engages with section 39 agencies is different from what applies in the case of section 38 agencies.  For example, the employees of section 39 agencies are not public servants, are not members of the public sector pension scheme and, unlike those in section 38 agencies, are not directly bound by Department of Health consolidated payscales.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the HSE developed a national standard governance framework for non-statutory sectors.  In 2010, under this framework, service arrangements were introduced between the HSE and section 38 agencies.  In 2013, the HSE sought to enhance the governance arrangements in place for these agencies and to strengthen the direct relationship between the HSE and the board of each agency.  Part of this enhanced governance was the introduction of annual compliance process and annual meetings between the HSE and chairs of all section 38 agencies.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that all section 38 agencies are in full compliance with the HSE requirements regarding board and corporate governance?  Will she confirm that all agencies adhere now to Department of Health payscales in all circumstances?  Will she confirm that the chairs and directors of all section 38 agencies have signed the compliance statement, as is now required?  Will she confirm that all of the overpayments to individuals employed in these agencies which have been notified to the Department of Health have now ceased?  Will she confirm the Government is satisfied with the oversight arrangements that are now in place to monitor what is State expenditure of &euro;3.8 billion?</p></speech>

These are under way by the Department of Health at present.  The purpose of these reviews is to establish the standard of governance in place in these organisations and to confirm independently the very points raised by the Deputy, that governance practice and procedures accord with those set out in the respective annual compliance statements.  The reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that internal financial controls and written financial procedures are in place in these organisations.  Six of these reviews are under way and their outcomes will inform the HSE's relationship with the agencies concerned and any further enhancements needed in the overall governance framework.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding in return for services to 40 agencies under section 38 and to a much wider group under the other section the Deputy raised, which is section 39.</p><p>The value of these relationships in terms of the money given by the Government is in the hundreds of millions.  The history has been that, to begin with, they were rather informal arrangements, but we have now moved to a point where they are far more formalised and, as the Deputy said, quite a number of changes in governance have been made.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform spoke earlier this morning about the payments made to the CEOs of section 39 bodies and the need to examine them to see if they were in line with the FEMPI legislation.  Regarding the agencies about which the Deputy has spoken, the Minister is following up as we speak.</p></speech>

Am I to understand neither she nor the Minister for Health can confirm that all of the agencies the Government funds are adhering to the Department of Health pay scales or that everybody employed in the agencies is being paid in accordance with the pay norms set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  Second, will she confirm that overpayments already formally notified to the Department of Health have ceased?</p></speech>

The Department is providing another layer to examine, with external consultants, the area once again.  Further work is being done to review the position again.  As I said to the Deputy about what he described as overpayments, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has spoken about this issue today and said his Department is examining it right now.  I understood from what he said earlier today that that was the position.  He is following up the matter.  It raises very serious concerns about the compliance of certain organisations with the standards laid down by the Government regarding payments to people who are delivering services paid for by the taxpayer.</p></speech>

The anti-poll tax campaign which, by the way, ended the political career of the Iron Lady, Maggie Thatcher, never achieved a 73% non-payment rate or anything like it.  If one was to find a fitting historical comparison, one might need to flick through the pages of maritime history.  On 14-15 April 1912 the unsinkable <i>Titanic</i>crashed into an iceberg in the icy waters of the north Atlantic, just as the Government's good ship water charges has crashed into the iceberg of mass non-payment.  The history books record what happened when <i>Titanic</i>reached tipping point two hours and 40 minutes later.  Her rate of sinking increased suddenly as her forward deck tipped under the water and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.</p><p>I suggest that 73% non-payment is not far off a tipping point.<br/><br/>Is the Government seriously going to try to use European Commission threats to save a sinking ship?  Is it seriously going to try to use a rigged commission to save a sinking ship?  Or, is the Government going to recognise reality and give this hated charge a decent burial?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it proposes to suspend domestic water charges from 1 July to 31 March next year.  During this period, no Irish Water customers will receive bills for domestic water charges.  The Government has charted a way forward.  Charges are being suspended for nine months, during which time we will have a discussion on the future funding of domestic public water and wastewater services.  The expert commission, under Kevin Duffy, will get on with its work and make recommendations on how we fund domestic water services.  The work is commencing and should take approximately five months.</p>  <p>  A special Oireachtas committee will examine the findings and recommendations, which will take approximately three months.  The Oireachtas will consider it and vote on the recommendations.  The process has been laid out and agreed, and the Government intends to follow it.  In the discussions here, we have seen the outline and detail of the path forward.  We believe it is the right route in order to discuss how the infrastructure, which is so necessary, will be funded.

Are we in a position, for example, to bring forward amendments to the motion?  Very important amendments need to be made to it.  For example, it is not clear whether voters in local elections, non-citizens, will be included in the citizens assembly.  It is also not clear whether any account will be taken of issues being discussed?  For example, if the issue is the eight amendment, will there be any weighting on the basis of gender, or if the issue is a matter which concerns the elderly, will the membership comprise members of the elderly population?  This initiative represents a complete outsourcing of decisions on key issues that should be made in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>This is a farce.  If the House does not agree to extend the debating time, it will be clear that it is just a ruse to get the Government off the hook about taking a decision on the eighth amendment and to delay it further down the road.</p></speech>

It seems incomprehensible given the fact that so many families are still in hotels with their children and that there is so much homelessness nationally that there could be 2,751 vacant units.  Has the sense of urgency or emergency not seized people so that they might ensure this would not be the case?  There are 600 vacant units in Cork alone between the city and the county.  There are 372 vacant housing units in Dublin City Council, where there are lots of families.</p></speech>

It is clear that the housing and homelessness issue is one of its centrepieces.  Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate to me when the strategy is going to be announced?  Can she give me a timeline in that regard?  Can she refer this to the Minister to ensure that the vacant unit issue is to the fore?  A disastrous decision was taken to cut the refurbishment funding available to local authorities in the last 12 months.  That should not have happened.  We now have the results.</p></speech>

Between 2014 and 2015, some 5,000 units were made available to those on the social housing list through funding provided under the refitting programme, which is financed by the Exchequer and the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  Between 2014 and 2015, funding of more than &euro;60 million was made available.  There is a high priority on returning units to use and giving funding to local authorities to do that.  That prioritisation will continue.  The Minister will announce the programme in the next week or so.</p></speech>

A part of that package was the patient safety (licensing of healthcare facilities) Bill, which is to provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health care facilities.  The legislative programme states that the heads of the Bill are expected at the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Patient and resident safety should be at the heart of the health service.  While progress is being made in some respects, there have been high-profile closures and incidents recently.  This week and next, the Health (Amendment) Bill will be before the Houses to deal with the extension of the timeframe for HIQA inspections, but when will we see more action on patient safety, particularly in light of what happened at autism centres recently?</p></speech>

I cannot think of any other occasion in our history when there was such a hiatus in enacting legislation.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about legislation within her own purview.  In April, the High Court declared the part of the law that allowed courts to reactivate suspended sentences unconstitutional.  Every day, courts across the country find people getting off suspended sentences that, before now, would have been activated.  Lawyers are bringing cases on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of the number of people who have benefitted from this decision to date?

Only in a tiny proportion has anyone got the benefit of the judgment, as another part of the legislation is being used successfully in court to defend cases.  We have been examining the legislation.

The Government secretly hoped that it would resolve the question or provide a basis for a resolution to that question by recommending the Government's preferred option of student loans.  Despite spin to the contrary, the report did not recommend that of the three options.  That option would have saddled students with debt, discouraging working class participation in third level education even further.</p>  <p>  What is the Government's proposed timeline for dealing with this question?  If a space opens up, this is an opportunity for the student movement in particular to put pressure on all of the political parties and demand a commitment from them all - not one like the written commitment signed by Ruair&iacute; Quinn - to free fees and to properly funded third level education.</p></speech>

We now have the very comprehensive report produced under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Cassells.  It outlines a number of funding options and has been referred to the education committee.  It is work such that will occur in the first instance.  Following this, the Minister will consider the options and make a decision, as he said.  Clearly, the precise timeframe depends on how long it will take the committee to carry out its examination.  The matter is urgent, as the Minister said.</p></speech>

It has become apparent that there is a four to five-year waiting list.  This is not on, especially for young girls and boys who are embarrassed to go out and meet their friends.  They may not even have teeth when they finally receive orthodontic treatment.  It is not fair.  How will the Minister address this problem which has been ongoing for a long time?

Last week, a family in my constituency received a telephone call at 4.30 a.m. asking that they remove from a hospital a 98 year old lady who had suffered an attack and been admitted to hospital the previous day.  It is appalling that such circumstances continue in the health system.  Will the Government ensure that no family receives a telephone call at 4.30 a.m. asking that they remove a family member from hospital?  As bad as this experience was for the family, it is even worse for the patient.  This appalling practice should be outlawed and eliminated.  It is a case of trying to improve bed management figures and it is not good enough.  I hope this issue, which has been raised previously by other Deputies, will be addressed and will no longer occur.

This review is now under way.  The purpose of these reviews is to build on some of the measures previously put in place in recent years, to establish the standard of governance in place in these organisations and to confirm independently that the governance practices and procedures accord with those set out in their respective annual compliance statements of those agencies.  These reviews will involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that internal financial controls and formal written financial procedures are in place in these organisations.  Six of these reviews are currently under way.  The outcomes of these reviews will inform the HSE's relationship with the agency concerned and any further enhancement that might be required in respect of the HSE's overall governance framework.</p>  <p>  The HSE is funding approximately 40 agencies under section 38 of the Health Act as well as providing funding for or grant-aiding to a far wider group of what we know as section 39 agencies.  The size of the 40 agencies delivering services ranges significantly from the Daughters of Charity, with an annual budget of a little over &euro;2 million, to St. James's Hospital, with a budget of almost &euro;357 million.  Section 38 agencies have played an important role in the development of our health and social care services.  Some agencies delivering services under section 38 arrangements are among the best we have in terms of the quality of care provided and the systems of governance employed.  However, there is an absolute requirement for all agencies to review their governance processes continually to ensure these are sufficiently robust.  In recent years, the HSE has taken significant steps to enhance its system for performance oversight of section 38 agencies.  However, I believe these additional measures, involving an external review and independent oversight, are essential and welcome.</p></speech>

This revelation coincides with news of cutbacks in the services of St. John of God's.  The HSE maintains it does not consider the St. John of God's organisation to be compliant with public pay policy in light of recent disclosures about the remuneration of senior staff.  Furthermore, I understand from newspaper reports that talks are under way which may see a number of senior personnel in the National Maternity Hospital being permitted to retain higher salaries.  How does the Minister reconcile these reports with those concerning St. John of God's?  Can the Minister identify which, if any, section 38 organisations are believed to be not complying with Government pay policy?  Is the Minister satisfied with the level of policing of pay policy in section 38 organisations in the wake of the top-up scandals?  Is the Minister satisfied that all Government requirements are being met by section 38 organisations?</p></speech>

That is why an investigation is now under way by the HSE in respect of those payments.  I have been clear, the HSE has been clear and, today, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has been clear in stating that if any payments have been made above and beyond the allowable level of payments, then those payments must be returned.  We cannot have a situation whereby some people working in St. John of God's are earning salaries lower than that of the chief executive and are subject to the FEMPI Act while people at the very top are earning large salaries and are not subject to it.</p><p>That is not fair and is not in accordance with the rules.  That investigation is ongoing.</p> <p> It is not just about whether I can guarantee or I can be assured, it is about whether we have the structures in place to have a degree of certainty.  I am not satisfied that we just have an internal HSE review as I want to bring in the external layer.  I want independent external consultants to examine all section 38 bodies to ensure they are not just signing on the dotted line to indicate that they are in compliance, but that they are actually in compliance.  That body of learning will inform whether we need to take more steps beyond what we are doing.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement of the review, which should be carried out as quickly as possible with any recommendations implemented as quickly as possible so we can ensure that no such overpayments will recur.</p></speech>

I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts when we discussed this issue back, I think, in 2013.  I, like most people on both sides of the House, was repulsed by the carry-on.  A number of measures have been implemented in terms of the charity regulator and with new structures in the HSE, but clearly more needs to be done.  I do not want and I know no Member of this House wants to see that voluntary sector damaged by bad practice.  Some of the best examples of high governance are present in the section 38 bodies.  Some of the best examples of care are present in the section 38 bodies.  However, any bad behaviour or wrongdoing needs to be weeded out as quickly as possible.  I will act on any recommendations.  As I said already, six of the 40 reviews are under way.  Every section 38 body will be subject to this external review.  That is about 40 agencies, which I think is appropriate.  It can give all of us reassurance and most importantly it can give the service users, who are often vulnerable people who depend on these services the level of reassurance they deserve.</p></speech>

I had the privilege and pleasure of representing home helps during the negotiations for the contract to which the question relates.  The purpose of the contract was to ensure they would have stability of hours with a certain degree of flexibility built in.  According to reports in the media, from which, disappointingly, we are getting a lot of information about the health service, these hours have now been banked and remain unused.  The purpose of the question is to investigate what is going on there.</p></reply>

As she rightly pointed out, she was part of a process that took place in April 2014.  Following the Labour Court recommendations, the HSE implemented the new contracts for HSE home-help staff with the agreement of SIPTU.</p>  <p>  At the end of April 2016, 33% of the target of 10.4 million home-help hours set in the HSE's national service plan had been delivered.</p>  <p>  The HSE and SIPTU agreed a revised contract for those providing home help to be operational from April 2014 under the auspices of the Labour Court.  This provides that the relevant employees are paid in full for their contracted hours.  However, where the hours they actually work drop below this, usually because of the changing needs of those in receipt of the service, the difference in hours, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, is banked on the understanding it will be worked at a later stage.</p>  <p>  This concept of banked hours is subject to quarterly review to ensure that excessive banked hours do not build up.  That normally comes into play when there are more than 100 hours.  Of the 6,900 part-time workers providing home help in January 2016, 67 workers, mainly in Cork and Kerry, had banked 100 hours or more.  In these cases, steps are taken to reduce the build-up, including by working relief for other home-help workers.  Contracted hours can be reduced for various reasons, including the preference of individual workers, availability of transport and the need for particular skills.  As reductions in contract hours for individual home helps are not collated nationally, unfortunately, I will not be able to give the Deputy some of the figures she has requested.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to work to apply available resources to most effectively target those with the greatest need and to provide the best possible contribution to the system as a whole.  Home-support services are provided on the basis of assessed health-care need and regularly reviewed.  Services are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  I am happy to say that the Government has been able to respond to this by providing an extra &euro;40 million for home care in 2016.  Not only will this ensure that the home-support services provided in 2015 are maintained but it will also ensure they are increased.</p></speech>

I asked for specific details about the number of banked hours.  She told me of about 67 people in the Cork and Kerry region who had banked 100 hours or more.  How many hours are banked in the system?</p>  <p>  I do not think any Deputy in the House would dispute Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the matter.  We are contacted on a daily basis by people who are very concerned because an elderly relative, a young sick relative or a relative confined to home for any reason is having home-help hours cut.  The HSE is cutting the hours to the vulnerable and those who need it the most while at the same time banking the hours of people who want to work.  It is also effectively cutting back on those hours.  I have asked a fairly simple question and I would appreciate if the Minister of State could answer it directly.</p></speech>

That is something the HSE has not done and it believes it would not be possible to allocate the resources to collate those data.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons for reducing home-help hours.  Sometimes it is down to the individual carer for various reasons.  In other cases it is due to shortage of funding.  We have increased the funding by &euro;40 million for this year, which means that the new base for next year will be &euro;371 million, up from &euro;331 million.  As we increase the funding going into home help and home-care packages, that slack will be available for the home-care workers to take up.  Unfortunately, I do not have the data the Deputy has requested.  It is not accessible to the HSE at the moment, but it is available locally.  If the Deputy has any specific local case, she could bring that to me and I could get the information on it.</p></speech>

I have brought that to the Minister of State now and perhaps she could come back to me with the answer.</p>  <p>  Some people are put to the pin of their collar now because their home-help services are being cut.  The only reviews that happen are reviews with a view to downgrading services.  The evidence of people who attend my clinics and those held by my colleagues supports that.  The Minister of State has not provided any evidence to dispute it.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State accept there is a crisis with home-help funding and home-help hours?  While the HSE is busy banking hours, some people desperately need those hours, which should be provided.  The Department should issue an instruction to the HSE to use all available hours, especially those hours that have been paid for.</p></speech>

All funding that has been allocated for home help and home-care packages will be used up.  The 2016 national service plan provides for 10.4 million home-help hours.  Home-care packages are measured separately but we need to move towards measuring them in the same way.</p>  <p>  On the question of home-care packages, we will be moving from 15,450 people to approximately 21,000 people because of the additional funding that has been provided this year.  If we start next year from a higher base and continue to increase it, as we have promised in our programme for partnership Government, then those figures will increase further.  It is a major priority for me and is a priority for the Department.  We will continue to increase the funding and increase the support services.  That will also help the workers.</p></speech>

I will work with all Opposition Members in improving services for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p>The establishment of a task force on personalised budgets is a key element of the commitment in the programme for Government to give people with disabilities greater control, independence and choice.</p><p>Personalised budgets transfer control back to the individual and give him or her the freedom to source the services and supports which best meet his or her needs.  While the concept of personalised budgets is not limited to health and personal social services, my view is that the task force should concentrate on personalised budgets for services for people with disabilities funded by the HSE in the first instance.  Some work has commenced on scoping how to introduce individualised budgets in health-funded disability services as part of the Transforming Lives reform programme.  The task force will build on this work.</p> <p> I am committed to setting up the task force as soon as possible.  I am in the process of finalising my plans in that regard.  I intend to inform the Government of my decision on who will chair the task force by the end of this month.  I also intend to outline to the Government on that occasion my plans for the appointment of members of the task force and the development of terms of reference, objectives, scope and key deliverables.  With the support of the Government, I will then proceed to appoint members and arrange for the first meeting as soon as practicable.  Some of the groundwork in this regard has commenced.  I have set myself clear targets.  I have said this is one of the projects I want to be set up and to be up and running within 100 days of taking office.

I am pushing forward a strong reform agenda.  The key issue for me is that the entire plan for disability services will be centred on the person with the disability, regardless of whether he or she has an intellectual or a physical disability.  I want to change the mindset in Irish society in respecting citizens of the State.  Over 600,000 people either have a disability or are in the same family as a person with a disability.  As members of society, the people concerned pay their taxes, just like everybody else, and have to be guaranteed services.</p>  <p>  On the issue of individualised budgets, I will engage with civic society to build an evidence base, gather data, research international experience and identify available options.  I emphasise that parents and families will have a choice in this regard.  We will not force any parent to accept an individualised plan.  Some parents might have different ideas.  The key point for us is to invest in and reform services and ensure money is spent on services.  In recent weeks we have seen other instances in which public moneys have been wasted.</p></speech>

I have previously served on that fine body and know that the Deputy will have an interesting day on Friday.  I have read the same documentation he has read on a certain organisation.  It is very disturbing and disgusting in parts.</p>  <p>  I have received a breakdown of the funding received by the 40 section 38 agencies from the HSE.  I will supply this information to the Deputy in tabular format.  It would not be possible to read all of it the House.  The total funding for these agencies was &euro;2.735 billion in 2013, &euro;2.747 billion in 2014 and &euro;2.883 billion in 2015.  As I said to Deputy John Browne, the annual grants provided for these agencies range from &euro;2.05 million in the case of the Daughters of Charity to &euro;356.87 million in the case of St. James's Hospital.</p>  <p>  Under its establishing legislation, the HSE is responsible for financial and performance oversight of agencies funded under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The HSE has a formal national governance framework within which such funding relationships are managed.  As part of this governance framework, the HSE requires all grant-aided non-statutory agencies to submit their annual audited accounts to it.  Furthermore, as part of its annual audit plans, the internal audit division of the HSE conducts audits of a number of agencies each year.  Several audits are in progress.  The documentation the Deputy was reading before he came into the Chamber, which has been referred to in the media, was the subject of an internal HSE audit.  Such audits generally focus on the systems of internal controls operated by the funded agencies and compliance with the HSE service level agreement.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of internal audits have been conducted of the HSE&rsquo;s own management processes and controls in the funding and monitoring of services provided by the non-statutory agencies.  When these internal audit reports are fully concluded, they are sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and routinely issued under freedom of information legislation.  I want to look at publishing all of them, as the Deputy has called on me to do.  However, I do not want to bring about an inadvertent delay in finalising an audit as a result of requiring it to be published automatically.  I want to work with the Deputy and his colleagues to try to get this done.  As I outlined to Deputy John Browne and as the T&aacute;naiste outlined, it is not good enough merely to have an internal look at this matter.  We also need to have an external look at it in order that we can ascertain how many lessons have been learned and how many recommendations have been made.  That is why we have brought in external consultants.</p></speech>

I remind him that I asked a considerable number of questions as part of the Estimates process.  A number of weeks have passed and I have yet to receive any response.  I hope this question will be answered within the timeline suggested by the Minister.</p>  <p>  The supervision of the agencies in question is a source of significant public concern.  The Minister has not answered the question I asked.  The public is rightly concerned about this issue.  Everybody in the House is aware of the level of public concern.  If an organisation such as Console can get away with what it got away with, even though it was receiving such a volume of funding, we must look at the incredible volume of funding being received by many other organisations.</p><p>They do fantastic work but we must ensure there is public confidence.  I am happy that, as the Minister says, the audits will be published as quickly as possible but what about <i>pro tem</i>?  The Minister said earlier in response to a question that he wished to ensure that there are established practices of governance.

If they were not there, God knows in what type of situation vulnerable people in this country would have found themselves.  What we must do is weed out the bad apples.  We must find the people who are not living within the rules.  That is the reason we have an annual compliance statement.  What is particularly upsetting and disturbing is that people in some cases are signing on the dotted line to say they are in compliance and that they are living within the pay structures, when they simply are not.  That is the purpose of the external review and the internal audit.  It is the reason for sending the internal audits to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>On the question about <i>pro tem</i>, I have examined this and I do not believe it works.  The reason is that when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, we had representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, appear before the committee to discuss that debacle.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government had a representative on the board of the DDDA.  The committee also had representatives of the Red Cross appear before it.  The Department of Defence had a representative on the board of the Red Cross.  The issue is that roles and responsibilities got extraordinarily confused.  I believe there are inadvertent consequences.  Who is the person responsible to - the board or the HSE?  I prefer to beef up these controls first.</p></speech>

The reason is that I asked the House to establish an Oireachtas all-party committee to develop a single long-term vision for health care over a ten year period.  It is important that those discussions are progressed before I give further consideration to the issue of establishing hospital groups on a legislative basis.  It would be disingenuous to move ahead with that while the committee is doing its work.</p>  <p>  With regard to senior hospital management positions, the HSE has developed eligibility criteria for senior management posts at hospital group and individual HSE hospital level.  The criteria reflect the particular experience, knowledge and qualifications required for specific posts and public sector recruitment policies apply to the filling of such posts.</p>  <p>  Regarding the hospital group board appointments, chairs are in place for all hospital groups and board members were appointed to three out of seven hospital groups - Saolta university health care group, UL hospitals group and the children&rsquo;s hospital group.</p>  <p>  The terms of office of the Saolta university health care group and the UL hospitals group boards are due to expire shortly.  Given the scale of the change process involved in implementing hospital groups, the hospital group boards must be populated with individuals with the expertise and competencies necessary to deliver on the strategic and change management agenda.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly advertise, through the Public Appointments Service process, for nominees to all of the hospital group boards, excluding the children's hospital group, and I expect to be in a position to populate all of those boards fully in the autumn, around the end of September.  All of those board appointments will be carried out through the Public Appointments Service.  It is important to do it that way for transparency.  There is benefit in populating the boards, even on an administrative basis.  There is a body of work to be done in terms of strategic planning for the hospital groups and the areas that could benefit from it.  I intend to populate the boards and to use the Public Appointments Service to do it.</p></speech>

He outlined eligibility criteria but he did not outline a transparent process.  We are seeing a complete replication of the same management that was previously in hospitals in senior executive and chief executive management positions in the hospital groups.  I will offer some examples.  One CEO of a group was previously a CEO of a main hospital.  They then became an executive of the HSE after which they became the chief executive officer of the group.  Another was a director of nursing at a large hospital.  They became the acting CEO of a hospital, then became the <i>de facto</i>CEO of the hospital and is now the CEO of the hospital group.  Another person was deputy CEO of a hospital who then became CEO of another hospital.  Guess what, a Cheann Comhairle?  They are now the CEO of a hospital group.  Where is the transparency around the appointments to these hospital groups?  It is a very important process of reform.  Apart from mentioning eligibility criteria, the Minister has not outlined how this Government or the previous Government delivered a transparent process of recruitment for the management of the hospital groups.  The Minister must clarify the matter.</p></speech>

That is what I was endeavouring to do in my initial response to the question, by outlining my philosophy and principal objective in how I intend to populate the hospital group boards which are not currently populated.  I assure the House that nobody will sit on a hospital group board or be appointed by me to such a board who has not come through the public appointments system.  That is important.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy raises a valid point relating to the appointment of senior hospital positions.  The Deputy is probably aware of the history of this.  There was a Government decision on 14 May 2013 on the reorganisation of public hospitals into hospital groups.  Sanction of that was conveyed to the HSE in July 2013.  There was an urgent request from the HSE in August 2014 to reassign senior managers from within the health service to the hospital group CEO posts.  That was done on the grounds of exceptional circumstances and with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It was also done on the basis that these proposals would not result in any additional senior posts within the health service, considering the financial situation of the country.  The Department also agreed that the individuals would be assigned to these posts for a period of up to 24 months in the first instance, so this issue will arise again and it will be up to me to develop policy for how we wish to move forward.</p></speech>

Their positions in the hospitals must be filled so a hospital senior executive manager has to move from another place.  We are seeing a <i>de facto</i>locum system for managers in our health service.  It is a managerial merry-go-round.  It is a cosy cartel, with insiders in senior executive hospital positions rotating around.  If we ran our hospitals in the same way as the managers are moving around, we would be in complete chaos.  It is the equivalent of consultants or senior clinicians rotating around the different hospitals every year, so they cannot implement change management.  We have a system of managers changing but no strategic change within our health service.  I urge the Minister to investigate the rotation of managers within senior executive positions in the health service.  It is not transparent, despite the exceptional circumstances.  I do not accept the point about the eligibility criteria.  I urge the Minister to deal with this matter soon.</p></speech>

We did not have a scenario whereby people were sanctioned for the rest of their career.  These appointments were made initially for 24 months, considering what the then Government decided was the particular and extraordinary circumstance of trying to get these hospital groups up and running.  There is a serious issue in the Irish health service, however, in terms of ensuring we can attract and retain the appropriate level of management and clinician we want.  I would appreciate it if the all-party committee on the ten year plan would examine that.  I am meeting hospital managers and hospital group CEOs at present and I am looking into the whites of their eyes and saying, "I need you to live within your budget" or "I need you to do this on patient safety".  I need to know that we have the calibre of people that is required and I do not mean this in any disrespectful way to the people currently doing their jobs.  However, the Deputy will be aware that there was difficulty in managing to find people to apply for the posts and certainly in finding anybody to agree to take up the posts.  These were the circumstances in which these individuals stepped up to the plate.  They are doing their best and, in many cases, are doing a good job.  It is for a 24-month period, after which it will be reviewed.</p></speech>

Currently there are 3,858 people on the outpatient list, which is double the size of the list anywhere else in the country.  Some 1,213 are waiting over a year and of those 371 are waiting for over a year and a half, which is almost as high as every other list combined.  There is clearly a Cork problem that needs to be dealt with in the interests of these women.</p></reply>

I understand from data provided by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, that at the end of June 2016 some 3,859 patients were waiting for gynaecology outpatient appointments and 458 were waiting for inpatient or day case gynaecology procedures at Cork University Hospital.  While these figures represent a welcome reduction on figures at the end of June 2015, there is a need to address the issue of waiting lists in a much more focused manner.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that ensuring timely access to health services is a key challenge and concerted efforts are and will continue to be made to improve the current situation.  My Department is engaging with the HSE in regard to the development of an action plan for each hospital in order to address waiting times.  Individual hospitals will be required to develop process improvement plans which will focus on improving chronological scheduling, validating waiting lists and ensuring that existing capacity is optimised and maximised, although I am not sure it always is, to be frank.  The action plan will be implemented over the remainder of 2016.  Within the HSE, a scheduled care governance group has been established to co-ordinate key initiatives in order to reduce waiting times and the number of patients awaiting treatment.</p>  <p>  Given it is an issue his party feels strongly about, I draw the attention of the Deputy to A Programme for a Partnership Government, which commits to a minimum of &euro;15 million in funding for the NTPF in 2017 to address waiting lists for those waiting longest, as part of a continued investment of a minimum of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting times.  My Department is currently engaging with the NTPF and the HSE to deliver on the programme's waiting list commitments.  In fact, I met with the CEO and chairman of the NTPF in the last two to three weeks to put them on notice that they are very much being reactivated.  I told them they should expect to receive a minimum of &euro;15 million in budget 2017 in order to get on and do what they were doing  - a very good job of in terms of clearing waiting lists - and I asked their views in addition to the views of the HSE and the Department of Health in regard to how best to maximise the &euro;50 million that will become available for waiting list initiatives.  I will look into the specific issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to the NTPF, for which &euro;15 million will be put in place in 2017.  This is 2016.  Since the beginning of the year, the number of people in Cork who are waiting over a year and a half for surgery has grown from zero to 39.  By the time the NTPF has come into place, that number will have grown again and perhaps even doubled.</p>  <p>  Has the Minister considered appointing additional consultants, given none has been appointed in the south-south west hospital group since this hospital was established seven years ago?  In fact, in spite of the fact that 28 posts are advertised in the remainder of the country, the place with the largest waiting list and the most distressed women is left with no additional consultants.  Has the Minister considered the possibility of using the under-used theatres that are available, given four were built and only one is being used for gynaecological services, while another is vacant?  This needs to be dealt with in the interests of these highly distressed people, their families and those around them.</p></speech>

It is cold comfort to people on waiting lists today to hear that the waiting list for this very procedure has fallen significantly in that hospital, given 4,622 people were waiting for this outpatient procedure in Cork University Hospital in June of last year and this is now down to 3,859.  The figure is still much too high but it is a reduction, and I acknowledge the work being done by the hospital in that regard.</p>  <p>  What people do not want from the Minister for Health is tea and sympathy; what they want from me is action.  I have taken action and, in particular, I have taken four actions in regard to waiting lists.  First, I have secured an additional &euro;500 million for the health service, the overwhelming bulk of which will go to our acute hospitals, which will enable hospital managers in hospitals such as Cork University Hospital to do what they are well paid to do, which is to get on and manage and to do some of the things the Deputy is asking that they do.  Second, I have put in place a small endoscopy initiative this year with the remaining funds available to the NTPF, which is something we can do now.  Third, I have put the NTPF on notice that it is going to receive a minimum of &euro;15 million in the budget in October.  Fourth, we have a commitment in the programme for Government for at least &euro;50 million for dedicated waiting list initiatives.  I agree we have to tackle this but I must be realistic in terms of what can be done.</p></speech>

In the meantime, there needs to be a clear path for these highly distressed people who are languishing on waiting lists for far too long.  What the Minister has outlined is helpful.  However, is there some way of advancing the NTPF so that people will be able to enjoy the benefit of it this year and get off the waiting list?</p>  <p>  With regard to consultants, unlike every other part of the country, the south and south-west, where the largest and most distressed group of people is located, does not seem to be getting anything and nothing is coming down the track.  Will the Minister make appointments to relieve the pressure?  The unused theatre should be available to relieve distress.  There are people on waiting lists throughout the county and this is impacting their quality of life.  For example, there have been delayed diagnosis of cancers due to the wait, which is seriously impacting quality of life.</p></speech>

It is very serious for people awaiting these procedures and people are waiting too long.  This is why we need a concerted effort to tackle waiting lists and why all of us in this House need to work together in the Estimates process to make sure we adequately resource our health service and the NTPF, as well as our hospitals, to address these issues.</p>  <p>  I will specifically raise with the hospital group CEO the issue the Deputy raises in regard to the unused theatres and the consultant posts, and I will pass on his comments in that regard.  I reiterate that I have asked every single hospital to put in place an action plan for waiting lists.  I have asked what they are going to do in their individual hospital between now and the end of this year to get on top of waiting lists.  We cannot have a situation where the Oireachtas last Thursday voted through an additional &euro;500 million for the health service yet we see waiting lists continuing to rise.  We need to make sure that when the money leaves the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it is spent absolutely in the interests of patients and on some of the other very important issues the Deputy has highlighted.</p></speech>

Is the Minister aware of the explosion in waiting times for outpatients and what plans will he outline in that regard?  I want to tease through what can be done to try to reduce those figures.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200020#S01200"><p>I thank the Deputy for introducing the question.  I have been made aware by him that the number of patients waiting over a year for an outpatient appointment in Cork University Hospital has increased since the end of last year.  However, these increases must be seen in the context of the overall increased demand for care and increased overall activity and productivity in our health system.  In fact, it was brought to my attention only today that 13,500 more elective surgeries have been carried out in the Irish health system this year than was the case last year, so we are seeing increased demand, increased activity and more procedures.  Nonetheless, it is a key challenge for us to ensure timely access to health services and I am assured by the hospital group that those patients whose clinical needs are most urgent are prioritised.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that improving waiting times for scheduled care is a priority for the HSE, my Department and, indeed, for the whole of Government, as I outlined to the Deputy's colleague.  A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the need for a sustained commitment to improving waiting times, with a particular focus on those waiting longest.  To that end, it commits to &euro;15 million in funding for the NTPF for an initiative targeted at those waiting longest as part of a continued investment of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting lists.</p>  <p>  I believe the policy of effectively deactivating the NTPF was a mistake.</p><p>We are beginning to see the consequences of this in terms of not having a ready made vehicle that can intervene in some of the particularly difficult situations highlighted by Deputy Moynihan.  This is why we need to get it back up and running and the Deputy's party and my party agree on this.</p> <p> The HSE has established a scheduled care governance group to co-ordinate key initiatives to reduce waiting times and the number of patients awaiting treatment.  The Department is engaging with the HSE on the development of an action plan, asking each hospital what more it can do to address waiting times, to be rolled out over the reminder of 2016.  I am conscious of the fact that for the first time in years the director general of the HSE has stated he has enough funding to deliver the service plan in front of him.  Hospitals will be instructed to develop and implement process improvement plans, focusing on improving chronological scheduling, clerical and administrative validation of waiting lists and the optimisation of existing capacity.  I expect this targeted approach, as well as the additional funding we now have available, will be of help to CUH in addressing the current backlogs.</p></speech>

Everything is backed up.  First consultations are backed up as are second consultations and when it comes to surgery, this is also backed up or stopped.  Not only is this at Cork University Hospital but it is throughout the Cork region.  In many instances, the waiting times for initial consultations have exploded.  The Minister spoke about the head of the HSE stating there is enough funding.  What is the Minister's thinking on getting to grips with the waiting lists for initial consultations?  When a letter goes from a GP to a consultant seeking an appointment for whatever trauma or illness the patient has, what is the Department's direct plan of approach in conjunction with the HSE to ensure the patient is dealt with in a timely fashion?</p></speech>

The very honest answer to the question is that we have a health system which lost 12,000 staff during the years of economic recession in the country and we have put back 6,000 of 12,000 staff but we need not pat ourselves on the back because we need at least another 6,000 to get us back to where we were before the financial collapse.  Continued investment in our public health service to ensure there is adequate capacity in terms of staffing numbers, consultant posts, as Deputy Moynihan's colleague mentioned, and front-line staff is absolutely the answer.  This is in regard to the specific question about ensuring someone receives an initial consultation.  If the person needs a procedure after this initial consultation, how do we make sure this can be done as quickly as possible?  I do not think now should be the time for ideological debate.  It needs to be a time for pragmatism.  If we have a vehicle like the NTPF, which can assist and work alongside public hospitals, it can move along the backlog.  I am absolutely committed to continuing to increase the number of front-line staff.  This is why we are seeing some delays because we still need more front-line staff in our hospitals.</p></speech>

Targets were set for waiting times by previous Ministers for Health.  Are these targets somewhere in the clouds?  Are they real or imaginary targets?  Is the Minister for Health setting higher targets to try to clear the list?  The initial answer to the question was about the seriousness of the referrals but many seriously ill people are awaiting referrals and initial consultations.  The Minister should not be under any illusion that the most serious cases are getting to the front at the start because this is not the case.</p></speech>

At present, 91% of patients wait less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months for inpatient or day case procedures and 92% wait less than 15 months for outpatient appointments.  We need to continue to do better but we need to not tie ourselves up in knots about targets.  We need to recognise that particular hospitals have particular backlogs and examine what interventions can take place there on the ground with proper management.  This is the idea of the action plan.</p>  <p>  There is another piece to this, which is whether some of these procedures can take place outside of hospitals.  An initiative we are carrying out is to ensure minor operations can be carried out by GPs in the primary care setting.  At present, 24 GPs are participating in a programme which will see 10,000 minor operations redirected out of hospitals and back into primary care settings.  Above and beyond this, there is also a diagnostic service, particularly with regard to ultrasounds, which is provided by GPs at ten sites nationally.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to support people in purchasing more diagnostic equipment to keep people out of hospitals and outpatient units in the first place and back in primary care.</p></speech>

These are in Eist Linn in Cork.  A young person who happens to experience a mental health crisis in Wexford may have to travel 200 km and might not even get a bed.  Does the Government intend to do anything about this?</p></reply>

He is right that many mental health problems arise at a very young age, sometimes a younger age than people like to speak about or even admit.  Inappropriate admissions is a very sensitive issue.  The reduction in the number of children admitted to adult psychiatric units continues to be a priority for the HSE's mental health services and it is a priority for me.  It is something that has been raised on a weekly and daily basis.</p>  <p>  Last week, I met the HSE specifically to review progress on this issue and to see what further improvements can be made in this regard.  I will be progressing this with the HSE over the coming months, particularly in the context of opening additional child and adolescent mental health beds and enhancing community-based care for young people across the regions while additional mental health staffing comes onstream.  I also intend to improve, where possible, the multidisciplinary approach at local level to ensure that existing best practice is standardised nationally.  Bearing this in mind, the Deputy will have to see we have made significant improvements in recent years.  In 2008, we had 247 admissions to adult units and this declined to 89.  While we saw a small increase last year, we are starting to see it move in the right direction.</p>  <p>  If we look at the figures, where a child has been admitted to an adult psychiatric unit or an inpatient unit, the length of stay has been kept to an absolute minimum.  The child is generally 17 to 18 years of age and while I am not saying this is okay or appropriate, we need to continue to put a variation of measures in place to see these figures reduce.  Our target is 95% and I would like it reach 100%.</p></speech>

As the head of the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, Mr. Des Kavanagh, recently stated, community-based mental health services remain a mere aspiration.  Surely the Government must target this area much more.  While we are complaining about the lack of facilities for inpatient mental health care, we all agree that unless the State is prepared to invest in community care and start actively working towards it now, we will not address the problems.  I come from the county with the highest suicide rate in the country.  This is directly linked to the fact we have more than 20% unemployment and more than 30% youth unemployment.  Sadly, we do not have the necessary facilities for people at community care level or for inpatient care.  For want of a better word, Wexford is a deprived county and problems in deprived areas, such as County Wexford, must be specifically addressed.</p></speech>

As he rightly pointed out, we have four acute inpatient child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, units in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  We have additional resources and facilities, which means we have 69 CAMHS teams.</p><p>While I admit they are not all full, we need to get to a position where the teams are full and we have an adequate number of staff.  If one looks at the figures it will be seen that the overall demand for CAMHS is rising.  In January 2,325 people were seeking the service while in May 2,612 were seeking it.  While those figures have increased, if one looks at the number of children admitted to the HSE adult inpatient units, in April there were 12 but that figure has now decreased to six.  In that regard, we are moving in the right direction, but a lot of work needs to be done.  Specifically, A Vision for Change is being reviewed.  A tender has gone out to carry out that review, which I hope will happen by the end of the year.  That vision has not changed.  We need to start moving towards a more community-based model.</p> <p> With regard to the Connecting for Life document, which specifically deals with suicide, there is a youth pathfinder project team which is dedicated to implementing the youth element of that.  We need to tackle the youth element of suicide and the problems arising at a younger age because if one tackles them at an earlier age, they are less likely to become problematic later.</p></speech>

I note a statistic that in 2011, 31% of child admissions were to adult units, compared to 28% in 2015, so that is to be welcomed.  Sadly, however, there continue to be a huge challenge in the area.  I do not expect the Government to be able to solve everything overnight.  In Wexford, for example, there are a lot of different groups involved in dealing with the challenges of mental health issues, many of which are charities.  We have heard a lot of talk about charities in the last couple of weeks, but the HSE is outsourcing a lot of work to charities that it should be doing itself.  We are trying to co-ordinate a range of groups and charities involved in mental health issues in Wexford at the moment.  One group involved is in the Campile area.  Two girls working in a pharmacy in Campile highlighted to me that they are shocked at the number of young people coming into the pharmacy and accessing prescribed drugs to deal with mental health issues.  It has grown dramatically.  The State has to play a stronger role.  The idea of the HSE outsourcing some of this to charities is not working very well.  There has to be a hands-on and more active approach on the part of the State.</p></speech>

In fairness, funding is now ring-fenced for mental health arising from action taken by the Minister of State's predecessor.  The figures are also being addressed.  The Minister of State is doing her best and any support she needs she will certainly get from our side of the House because community intervention is necessary.  However, I ask her to provide the House with the complete figures for the number of people accessing adult facilities, including where and by what region.  Some one in five teens report moderate to severe depression in his or her final two years of being a teenager.  A very good programme called the Jigsaw proposal was rolled out by Headstrong.  I ask the Minister of State to support it and to advise the House about the roll-out of this proposal and its timelines.  I understand a number of different areas are interested in it.  Will she support their endeavours?</p></speech>

In May 2016, the most recent figures available, 97.2 of the bed days used were in child and adolescent inpatient units, which is an improvement of 95.4% on April.  Our target is 95%.  We are steadying out at the moment.  I admit that any kind of inappropriate admission is not acceptable, which is why we need to continue to work on increasing our beds and staffing and to make sure that we have community-based care so that children do not need to go into acute services.  In that regard, as I have already mentioned in the Chamber, the youth mental health task force, which I will announce next week, will tie in the voluntary, private, public and all the different sectors together to work together.  I would very much like to get to the stage where we do not need charities to provide these services.  We will have succeeded if we get to that stage, but we are a long way from there, so we need to work together.  That is exactly what the youth mental health task force will aim to do.</p></speech>

It is not possible for every area and not every area wants or needs one.  I was in Carlow only last week, which has an excellent service but it is not necessarily needed.

Unfortunately, at one stage, my own town was known as the suicide capital of the world, so Deputy Wallace and I know where we are coming from.  A Vision for Change is ten years old.  Recently the PNA and the RCSI have said that A Vision for Change is still perfect.  I could make the relevant points that have mostly been made already, but there is a growing fear out there within communities that the Government intends to scrap A Vision for Change and will seek to enter into a more privatised model using its own failure to implement reforms as an excuse.  The people to whom I have spoken have said that this would be totally unacceptable.  I wish to put on the record that we need to implement the plan.  Let us not talk about reviews any more.  I ask the Minister of State to implement the basic elements of A Vision for Change, such as the 24-7 crisis intervention and the five-day week changing to seven-day week intervention houses.  At the moment there is not one crisis house in any community in this country.</p></speech>

The review has to make sure that we do not just focus on mental illness; we need to focus on health and well-being and move more towards the community setting.  The review is taking place and the tender has gone out.  We hope that once the tender is approved and the review is finalised at the end of the year, in tandem with that, we will still be implementing A Vision for Change.  As I said, the document and the fundamentals have not changed, but we need to start moving towards a more preventative model, instead of the reliance on institutions.  I believe we are doing this.  I take on board what the Deputy says.</p></speech>

In that regard, I have been assured that the HSE seeks to ensure that those whose clinical needs are most urgent are prioritised accordingly, while the needs of others are assessed in terms of those waiting the longest.  Therefore, in the case referred to by the Deputy of an 84 year old gentleman, people should be able to look at that situation locally and clinically and see the importance of that procedure.</p>  <p>  Improved waiting times for planned or scheduled care for all patients is a key priority for the HSE, my Department and the Government, and I will not repeat what I have said to some of the Deputy's colleagues already regarding our plans to reactivate the NTPF and to put additional resources into dedicated waiting list initiatives, involving a minimum of &euro;50 million in the budget due to be delivered in October.  Only this week my officials have been meeting with the NTPF and the HSE to draw up terms of reference to make sure that we are ready to roll out the programme as quickly as possible, once budget 2017 has been implemented.</p><p> On the Deputy's query regarding the position in County Kerry, while 155 patients with addresses in County Kerry are awaiting cataract procedures, the waiting list has decreased by 20% in the past 12 months.  I am also informed that the South-South West Hospitals Group is developing a single ophthalmology service operating on two sites, to which the Deputy alluded, at University Hospital Waterford and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork.  To particularly try to assist patients from County Kerry, the group is also exploring the introduction of an imaging system to enhance and streamline ophthalmology services for patients seen in County Kerry.  I will ask the relevant officials to investigate the specific case if the Deputy will provide me with the details.  Although there has been a reduction in the waiting list of approximately 20%, I accept that there is much more to be done.</p></speech>

I will give him some figures, given that he likes to deal with facts.  In 2015, 680 patients were seen in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, of whom 98 were from County Kerry and 582 from County Cork.  While I do not want to get into a turf war, the figures speak for themselves.  While 14.4% of the patients were from County Kerry, 85.4%, or six times that number, were from County Cork.  The population of County Kerry is 145,000, compared to 519,000, or three times that number, in County Cork.  Given that the size of the ageing population in County Kerry is greater, the need should also be greater.  However, we are only seeking parity, but something is not adding up.  People from County Cork are being seen quicker.  The facts and figures speak for themselves.  I ask the Minister to investigate the matter.</p></speech>

His leader probably would not appreciate my becoming involved in a Cork <i>v</i>. Kerry spat.  The Deputy's point is very serious about ensuring equity of access to the health service.  The idea of the hospital group structure is not to look at the local hospital or county but to take a geographically wider view.  This is why the South-South West Hospitals Group has been established.  It is considering an additional imaging system which could be put in place to enhance and streamline ophthalmology services for the people of County Kerry.  There could be some benefit to it.  There has been a significant reduction in the waiting list in counties Cork and Kerry being grouped together.  I want to see a further reduction in waiting lists, which is why I intend to roll out a number of new waiting list initiatives shortly.</p></speech>

The service has moved from one hospital to another.  Perhaps it might be worth examining whether the reconfiguration of services has resulted in a reduction in waiting times.  If it has not, it should.  We must hold a department to account.  I am sure there was much lobbying to have it provided in one facility.  It is now in place and we need to get it working.  Is the NTPF for inpatients only or does it also apply to outpatients?  If it does not, perhaps we might have this discipline included in it.</p></speech>

I have had a very open conversation with the NTPF.  Its terms of reference are broad.  It exists to carry out specific tasks as are assigned to it by the Minister for Health of the day.  I have asked that we have a conversation about other areas where it considers it could make a difference.  The optimal position which we want to reach is one where the public health service meet the demands of public patients.  However, I also acknowledge that the Deputy and a number of his colleagues on both sides of the House constantly raise the fact that there are a number of acute cases where patients have been waiting extraordinarily long times for procedures.  Although they are often relatively basic procedures, they could make a major difference to their lives.  If the NTPF is a useful and pragmatic way to address this issue, I am very open to it.  I will have the issue examined.</p></speech>

On the specific issues raised by the Deputy, I am advised by the HSE that quality and patient safety are the responsibility of all staff and core to service provision across primary care services, including addiction services.  The HSE addiction service is working towards implementation of the HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare which provide for a strategic approach to improving safety, quality and reliability in national health services.</p>  <p>  Services providing opioid substitution treatment operate from relevant clinical management guidelines and protocols, including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on methadone and buprenorphine for the management of opioid dependence, the relevant Irish College of General Practitioners guidelines and the national drugs rehabilitation framework.  In line with these guidelines, the ongoing treatment of an individual involves regular assessment of risk and appropriate responses to any identified risk.</p>  <p>  Arising from recommendations made in the introduction of the opioid treatment protocol of 2010, a clinical guideline for opiate substitution treatment has been drafted by a HSE-led committee which includes clinical expertise.  These are the first national guidelines that specifically relate to opiate substitution treatment in HSE clinics and primary care settings.  The guidelines are under consideration by the quality improvement division of the HSE and expected to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A national hospital discharge protocol for homelessness has been approved.  The aim of the protocol is to ensure clear procedures are in place between health services, local authority homeless action teams and the voluntary sector.  It is important that all discharges from acute and mental health care services of persons experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness b planned in order that the necessary accommodation and supports will be in place prior to discharge.</p></reply>

I have been trying to pursue the case for 18 months and obtain information.  The answer I kept getting was that the services did not know where the person in question was.  There is no doubt that the person was on a significant downward spiral and that her life was at major risk.  However, she was attending various services, sometimes with extremely chaotic behaviour, for which I allow.  She was in the care of the HSE from when she was aged under 18 years.  Her two children were also in the care of the HSE.  Given that she was registered as homeless, there were default addresses for her.  She was attending a methadone clinic, a needle exchange clinic and her family doctor in Dublin 8.  She was a regular patient at St. James's Hospital and James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown.  She was in contact with her solicitor and although her solicitor was in touch with the HSE, it did not contact the solicitor to try to find out exactly where she was.  Although nothing will bring her back, there must be reassurance that all measures were taken that could have averted her death.  While there will always be questions of "what if" and "if only", her family needs to know that they have been covered and it needs the information.</p></speech>

I understand the Deputy's frustration because I read some of the other notes on the case.  Deputy O'Sullivan is right in that the person in question was receiving services in different centres throughout the city.  Unfortunately, my reading of it is that she fell off the radar.  There are certain circumstances surrounding this case that need to be examined.  I hope the Deputy will be find it acceptable if I tell her that I will pursue it again with the HSE to try to get a further sense of the issues and of what exactly happened to this person.  It is a very sad case.</p></speech>

It is important that we learn from this case.  The lesson is about joined-up thinking.  There has to be cohesion between HSE addiction services, The Drug Treatment Centre Board, primary care and homeless services, the family, and, if involved, the solicitor, particularly if it is a person who is at high risk and everyone knows it.</p>  <p>  There probably is a need for a centralised database because people can go from one primary care area to another.  There should be a record of where exactly they are to avoid confusion between the various areas.  I accept this person was chaotic and moved about considerably.  However, I believe - as I know the Minister of State does too - there is a possibility of recovery in every person who is in addiction.  All the policies, plans and strategies sound great on paper but it is only when they are applied to a particular person that we see if they are working, can they work and where we need to go.</p></speech>

The HSE provides a range of community based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible.</p>  <p>  Home support services in Longford and Westmeath, similar to the experience elsewhere throughout the country, are being stretched by demands from people for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, which all cost more.  Thankfully, the Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40 million for home care in 2016.  The targets for 2016 are being reviewed in light of these additional resources.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that home care needs more resources than are currently available.  For this reason, the programme for Government commits to increasing funding for home care packages and home help year-on-year in the coming period.  There is always more that can be done in these crucial areas but it represents a step in the right direction.  I am happy that we have been able to respond to the problems that have arisen this year.</p>  <p>  On the two counties mentioned, all I can say at the moment, having only voted through the Estimates last week and the additional &euro;40 million in funding, is that the HSE is engaging with the local community healthcare organisations, CHOs, to see how this support can be provided.  The additional support should be distributed where it is needed.</p></speech>

The hours in Longford-Westmeath have been cut.  If someone who had ten hours passes away today, only 25% of those hours are reallocated.  I can give the House three examples in my constituency.  The first is of a gentleman who is wheelchair bound and whose wife, his primary carer, died of cancer three months ago.  He has been approved additional home help hours to keep him out of a home, yet no additional home help hours became available.</p>  <p>  The second is of a woman in her late 80s who was discharged out of St. Vincent's Hospital in Athlone and who has to be lifted in and out of bed in a hoist.  She has only two sons.  Where is the dignity in a woman in her 80s having to be cared for by her two sons?  She has been approved home help hours but she has received none.  She is facing the real possibility of having to go into a nursing home.</p>  <p>  The third example is that of a gentleman in County Longford.  This man is being fed through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, is confined to a wheelchair and is doubly incontinent.  His sister took retirement to provide him with full-time care.  He spent eight weeks in hospital.  He has been approved home help hours but he has only received ten of the 20 hours approved.  His sister was made swear an affidavit that she would take him out if he was taken in for two weeks' respite.  The woman is at breaking point.  She cannot take him home.</p>  <p>  I do not know how the Minister of State can say she is happy that she has been able to respond.</p></speech>

When I say that I am happy, I mean that I am happy we have been able to allocate an additional &euro;40 million in funding, which will help in the different cases mentioned by the Deputy.  Unfortunately, we all know of similar cases within our constituencies.  They are brought to my attention daily.  As I pointed out, the Estimates were only voted on last week and it will take a number of weeks for this to make its way through the system.  However, with that additional funding, the service plan for this year will be able to target 10.4 million home help hours, which will support 47,800 people.  It is estimated that approximately 21,000 people will now benefit from the initial figure of 15,450 home care packages.  It also means that we can increase our base for next year.  While our base for home care help and packages was &euro;331 million, it will increase to &euro;371 million.  We have given a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to increase it year-on-year, so that figure will only get bigger.  I am not happy with the current situation, but this is a step in the right direction and we need to continue moving in that direction.</p></speech>

If additional hours are being made available and additional money is available, why is it that only 25% of existing hours which have been in place for the past six, 12 and 18 months are being reallocated?  How is it fair that only 25% of existing hours are being reallocated?  How is that equitable?  How will it keep as many people in their own homes, which is something we want?  If they are not supported, these people will end up in long-term nursing home care.  This will cost more money in the long run.</p>  <p>  It makes economic sense and good social sense to keep people in their homes.  The Minister of State said that &euro;40 million has become available.  When will we see the benefits of it?  When will the people of Longford-Westmeath to whom I referred get their home help hours?  Saying we have made money available is no good, it does not wash for the people who need the hours now.</p></speech>

I welcome the &euro;40 million, but there is a gap period and we are not seeing this funding on the ground.  HSE officials tell me that when it is distributed it will only bring the hours back up to a certain level, which is only a drop in the ocean.  That is what the Minister of State's officials are saying.  I am telling her the truth.</p>  <p>  I know of a lady in Newport who has dementia and a terminal illness.  She is to get ten hours.  It is an incredible scenario.  I had to fight to get it increased from five hours to ten.  My real point is that this is financially the most solid thing the Government could do.  It costs &euro;7,000 if a person is kept, bed blocking, in a hospital.  It costs on average &euro;1,500 to have someone in a nursing home versus &euro;500 for the cost of a reasonable amount of home help.  This is socially the right thing to do, but financially it is also the right thing to do.  I ask the Minister of State to please go back and get adequate funding for this service.</p></speech>

We know that in the first quarter of last year there was a significant increase in requests for home help and home support.  To ensure that number did not drop this year, funding was allocated which meant significant additional funding had to be allocated.  This is the &euro;40 million to which I have referred.  I believe this will not just level out the same funding from last year but will see an increase.  I am not saying it is enough.</p><p>The Minister has made it very clear that he has spoken to the different hospital groups to make sure they stay within their budgets.  The more they stay within their budgets, the more it allows us to put more money into the home help service and home care packages, which will see a change in where the funding is being allocated and that will result in a saving all around.</p></speech>

Voluntary and non-statutory service providers, including religious orders, have a long history of providing health and personal social services in Ireland and of receiving State funding to provide such services.  I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of all such providers to the delivery of these essential services.  I remarked earlier in this House that were it not for some of those voluntary service providers, one wonders how many of our people would have been cared for throughout the years in this country in terms of disability services, mental health services and other services.</p>  <p>  The HSE, however, has a statutory responsibility - one cannot delegate that -  for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As well as providing services directly, the HSE enters into service agreements or arrangements with service providers to provide such services on its behalf.  As Minister for Health, my priority is ensuring that all of the resources available to the HSE are used in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the Irish public.  To that end, the HSE has a formal national governance framework which governs grant funding to all service providers under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  This framework seeks to make sure that governance systems are sufficiently robust and effective to ensure that both the HSE and the grant-funded agencies, be they religious orders, irrespective of denomination, or other voluntary or non-statutory service providers, meet their respective obligations.  The most critical issue for me, regardless of whether the service provider is a religious organisation, is whether the service is being provided for which we the taxpayer, through our health service, are paying.</p>  <p>  I do not have an ideological position on the involvement of religious organisations in the delivery of health care.  I believe there is scope for diversity in the range of service providers delivering health care - that has always been the way in this country - but that service must be delivered and, let me clear on this, in line with Government health policy, legislation and the responsibilities attaching to the use of public funding.  Once an organisation is complying with our health policy, the Government's policy, the legislation passed by this House and the responsibilities attaching to the use of the public money, the matter of whether the service provider is a religious or non-religious organisation is not something that keeps me awake at night.</p></speech>

The Minister said the key issue is the whether the service is being provided, so let us get down to the nitty-gritty on that.  I refer to an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>of 9 May.  The headline stated: &quot;Catholic ethos restricting St. Vincent's Hospital from procedures.&quot;  The article stated that doctors working at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group in Dublin are being restricted from carrying out procedures that are contrary to Catholic ethos.  It stated that gynaecologists and urologists said they were not allowed to perform procedures such as vasectomies and tubal ligations for patients who want to permanently prevent pregnancy.  It further stated that the doctors contradicted assurances given by management which had insisted there were no restrictions stopping its doctors from performing these procedures.  Doctors at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin city centre said they faced the same restrictions.  It also states that the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's hospital receive &euro;450 million in State funding between them each year.  Mr. John Thornhill, the President of the Irish Society of Urology said vasectomies were &quot;not allowed in hospitals in the public sector with a Catholic ethos&quot;.  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200025#X00900"><p>As I said very clearly already, my responsibility as Minister for Health is to make sure that we are delivering the services that the Irish public require in terms of their health and well-being.  My responsibility is to ensure that the funding this House approves for me to expend on the health service is disbursed by the HSE, either spent by it or disbursed to voluntary organisations, and that we get value for money and get the services that we pay for and require.</p>  <p>  I set health policy on behalf of the Government; nobody else and no religious order sets health policy.  Therefore, I feel very strongly, and I share Deputy Barry's view on this, that where the HSE or the taxpayer is funding the service, it is this House and this Government that set the policy and not any other house or any other type of governing body.</p>  <p>  There is obviously an issue of conscientious objection and that may be the issue to which the Deputy is referring.  That could potentially arise in the context of the provision of treatment and services in health care facilities run by religious organisations.  The European Court of Justice has outlined that this conscientious objection remains a limited right derived from religious freedom that cannot lead to the restriction of the rights and freedoms of another person.  However, a health care professional's conscientious objection absolutely does not absolve his or her duty of care to the patient.  Therefore, he or she could not abandon the patient or cause the patient's care to suffer in situations where such a transfer would not be possible.  This is in line with the approach outlined in the Medical Council's guide to professional conduct and ethics which facilitates the transfer of a patient from one doctor to another.</p></speech>

According to its audited financial statements for 2014 provided to the Companies Office in November 2015, its directors include Lorcan Price, who is also a director of the Pro Life Campaign.  In 2014, the HSE gave Anew, formerly Life Pregnancy Care, nearly &euro;0.5 million in funding, 83% of Anew's total budget.  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</p></speech>

I recently met people involved in the Termination for Medical Reasons, TFMR, group, and we had a discussion on a number of issues regarding ensuring consistency in terms of access, particularly to bereavement counselling and procedures.  I have undertaken in regard to bereavement standards to make sure that phrases such as "fatal foetal abnormality" feature as opposed to just phrases such as "life limiting conditions".  I am very clear on this view.  I do not care too much, to be quite frank, once the service provider provides the service but I do not want any patient in this country not to be able to access a service that is in line with my policy as Minister for Health and the policy of this House and of the Government.</p></speech>

The Department published a request for tender last month to invite parties interested in undertaking a review of A Vision for Change to express an interest in doing so.  The Department's requirements are for experts to review and analyse national and international evidence and best practice in the development and delivery of mental health services.  The review should also identify sites of best practice, outlining reasoning and identify how these models can apply to the Irish context.  The review is also expected to assess the current delivery of mental health services in Ireland having regard to international evidence and the implementation of A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the review will be completed later this year.  The review will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change and it will have regard to both human rights and health and well-being objectives.  As I said in a response to Deputy Wallace earlier, we need to move away from specifically focusing on mental illness.  When the review is completed, the Department will examine the output and will then decide on the need for a monitoring group to oversee any required policy changes.</p>  <p>  The contract will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.  It will be split into two sections, 50% of it will be based on cost, a further 30% will be based on the quality of proposed methodology and 20% will be based on demonstrated ability by way of previous experience on the part of the tenderer to carry out the work.  I hope that the review will be finalised at the end of the year.  The next step will be to see whether we need an oversight group to implement the changes that will have been recommended.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed that it will take until the end of the year.  The term of A Vision for Change ran out in January; the ten years were up.  A Vision for Change provided for an independent monitoring commission, which sat for two periods, 2006 to 2009 and 2009 to 2012.  It has not sat since then.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether it will sit in the meantime while we are waiting for the review to be completed.  A Vision for Change was visionary ten years ago and it remains visionary.  The difficulty is it has never been implemented.  It foresaw that Governments would not implement it.</p><p>That is why they asked specifically for a review after ten years to see how effective it had been and, more importantly, for an independent monitoring group to run simultaneously to monitor whether it was implemented or not.  Can the Minister of State confirm the situation in relation to the independent monitoring group?</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the vision has not changed.  While the review is under way, we are continuing to implement the report.  In recent years, the Government has provided an additional &euro;160 million in ring-fenced funding for mental health from 2012 to 2016.  That has progressed the implementation to various degrees of the actual document.  While the independent group to which the Deputy refers is currently not established, it is a question I have been raising and something I would like to consider once the review is finalised at the end of the year.  We need to take that time.  While it might seem like a long time, it is something I could come back to the Deputy on, depending on the recommendations.  We need some form of oversight committee to put in place a timeline to ensure that we are progressing at adequate speed.</p></speech>

The last time the group sat was 2012 and yet the Minister of State stands up and tells me what money has gone into it.  While I welcome the investment, there is no independent group to tell us how effectively it is being used and whether it is being used at all in the most efficient way possible.  That was all anticipated.  Now we are going forward with another review that is going to take the whole year.  To me it is unacceptable.  All of this was laid down in 2006 and even then it was not in a vacuum.  It was based on a report going back to 1984 on planning for the future.  It is extraordinary that we find ourselves in 2016 with the tender only now going out and the review group.  It will not be ready until the end of the year while in the meantime, the Minister of State cannot tell me whether an independent group will be set up to monitor what has happened to date.  That was part of the original recommendation.  All of that said, the plan should be taken together and not piecemeal.</p></speech>

While the review may seem like a long time, if we wait until the end of the year to implement the committee, it will have oversight of what we have implemented to date and of the recommendations being put in place by the review committee itself.  We must continue to focus on moving towards a more community-based environment for our mental health services.  For my part, that means working with the mental health review commission and a lot of the other organisations which have provided significant oversight on this and rightly pointed out where we are failing, where we are not and where we need to improve.  It is important that I continue to work with them in that regard.  My view is that once the review is completed, there should be some form of oversight committee or board.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200026#Y00800"><p>I am delighted to be given the opportunity to speak today on the issue of home care packages.  As with all Members of the House, health is a constant issue at my weekly clinics.  Access to vital health services is a challenge, waiting lists are increasing and securing home care is a constant struggle for many older people.  Most of us like to think that when the time comes, we will have the means to care for ill or aging family members who, given the choice, would rather be in their own homes than in a hospital or nursing home.  This is where the home care package comes in.  The package consists of a range of services provided by the HSE to facilitate the care of older people in their own homes.  Whether it is therapy, home help, respite, transport to and from medical appointments, or day-care services, the package aims to make it easier for people to remain independent for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  The HSE has a core provision of &euro;324 million for home supports in 2016 and its national service plan for the year provides for a target of 10.4 million home help hours, 15,450 home care packages, 130 intensive home care packages for clients with very complex needs and a further 80 packages for clients with dementia.  While I welcome this provision, the unfortunate reality is that accessing these services on the ground can be a very frustrating and protracted process.  The suspension of home help hours and home care packages in February of this year has had a major impact and the effects are still being felt.  On a system-wide basis, the cuts have ended up costing dearly, both financially and in terms of patient health.  Increased pressure has been placed on an already creaking system through delayed discharges from hospitals and more people have being re-admitted to hospital due to inadequate supports in the community and home.  Respite care is another issue.  Good home care provision ideally supports both a medical and social model of care whereby both the carer and the cared-for person are supported physically with therapy, respite and home help and psychologically.  It should allow the carer time to get a much needed break.  Again, I have been contacted by a number of constituents this week alone who expressed their dismay that the provision of respite care at Maynooth community care centre had been reduced to two beds for the entire area.  I am awaiting clarification of this via a parliamentary question I have submitted but it appears the centre is no longer allowed to use primary care beds for respite.  This appears to be totally at variance with Government policy and with the commitment given in the programme for Government to increase funding for home care packages and home help every year.</p>  <p>  Older people prefer to live in their own homes and this can be assisted by providing home care packages or home care hours and making their physical environment more suitable for their needs.  However, there was a decrease of 83,346 home help hours in Kildare between 2010 and 2015.  I hope the recent announcement by the Minister for Health of the Government's approval of a Revised Estimate for the Department of Health means there will be increased resources for home care services.  I ask the Minister of State to be more specific on this funding.  Does she agree that at minimum 2.2 million extra hours of home help and a further 3,500 home care packages for older people are required?  Is that a target the Government will commit to meeting?  </p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of intensive home care packages, especially for people with dementia.  Most people living with dementia and their families want to provide for their care at home.  Can we step up the provision of intensive home care packages to achieve this?  There is now an urgent need for the Minister for Health to deliver, as a priority, the projected increase in funding for home care packages as included in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

Our population is ageing rapidly.  Advances in health care are leading to a dramatic rise in our older population.  Each year, the total number of persons over the age of 65 grows by approximately 20,000.  We can see what the figures will be in the coming years.  There is now a stronger emphasis on home care and other community services which provide a greater range of options to avoid admission to acute hospitals, support early discharges and, where appropriate, rehabilitate and re-able patients after periods of particular difficulty.  Older people have consistently said that they want to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and the Government is committed to facilitating this.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am committed to facilitating this as much as possible.  Home care services are key to achieving this and the strengthening of home care services is an objective to which the Government is committed.  The HSE provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring that older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible.  The HSE's national service plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million home help hours to support approximately 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450 home care packages and 130 intensive home care packages for clients with complex needs.  A further 60 clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish national dementia strategy.</p><p> Notwithstanding the significant improvements in the overall economic position that we have seen in recent times, pressures continue to apply across the health service.  Services are being stretched by demands from more people and for more hours at times outside core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which costs more.  The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40 million for home care services in 2016.  As I told the Deputy's colleague, the HSE is engaging with local community health organisations, CHOs, to establish how that funding can best be divided and spent.  Those most in need must receive it first.  I hope this will happen as quickly as possible.  If the Deputy wishes to keep in touch, I will be in regular contact with the HSE to determine when that funding will be passed down.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in the light of the provision of these additional resources.</p> <p> There is always more that could be done in these crucial areas, but this represents a step in the right direction.  I am delighted that the Government has been able to respond to the increased demand for services by providing additional funds.  The allocation of these funds in the most appropriate way is a priority for the HSE.  Prudent management of available resources is needed as demand for services increases.  The HSE will continue to work to apply the available resources to target those in the greatest need most effectively and provide the best possible contribution to the system as a whole.</p> <p> There is no doubt that home care services need more resources than are available.  For this reason, the programme for Government commits to increasing funding for home care packages and home help services year on year in the coming period.  I cannot give the Deputy an exact figure, but I will seek as much funding as it is physically possible to increase the figures he outlined.</p> <p> Respite care services are of the utmost importance, not just for the individual who needs care but also for carers who are among the most important people in our society, something we might not recognise enough.  Sometimes, respite care provision is the only break they get.  We must see an increase in funding in line with that for home care packages.</p> <p> On the issue of dementia, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have met the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I have met it several times independently.  We are working with it on how we can increase funding and provide specific dementia care packages for dementia sufferers.</p></speech>

I do not doubt her commitment to making improvements where they are needed badly, particularly for the elderly.  She is aware of the difficulty in this regard, from the response to one of my colleagues, that what is happening on the ground is different from what is being reported within departmental or other official circles.  Given her offer, I would welcome the opportunity to meet her outside the Chamber to discuss this matter in detail.  There is a problem with the service provider and the service user.</p>  <p>  We are discussing the issue of hours, but I could give the Minister of State a list of 44 cases.  She could give me as many, as could other Deputies.  In Kildare North applicants have received approval for a home help service, but HSE officials have called to their homes in the past week to take the service away from them.  I am not in the Chamber to play theatre with the Minister of State.  I do not believe in engaging in such opportune politics for the optics.  I believe in working hard for the people who elected me, representing them to the best of my ability and seeking the services they need.</p>  <p>  An elderly lady who is partially sighted has received no home help service since February or March.  Recently, she was told that she would not receive such a service unless she paid for it herself.  An elderly man was meant to come home from hospital, but he was transferred to a hospital in Dublin on Friday because a home care package had not been approved for him, even though one had been identified and charted for him by his consultant.  In the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire the medical profession has as difficult a job to do as anywhere else and there is a waiting list.  I spoke to a constituent on Friday evening who, despite waiting, could not be discharged because a home care package had not been approved.  I am aware of a couple in their 70s and the woman has dementia, is incontinent and needs to be showered daily, as recommended by the medical professionals.  After she has her shower on Friday at 10 a.m., she will not have another until Monday at 7 p.m.  The man gets two three-hour breaks on Monday and Thursday nights.  He receives a home help service for approximately two hours to do household chores.  Last week two HSE officials arrived like the Mafia and took them from him.  He has lost a service for two and three quarters hours.</p>  <p>  We need to have this issue addressed.  These are the real issues and I need the Minister of State's help.</p></speech>

There is a major flaw in the system, in that significant amounts of money are being used to keep people in hospital and acute units when we know that the financial benefits to the HSE and the Department in keeping them at home are considerable.  There are also the physical benefits.  When people are surrounded by their families and involved in their communities, naturally they get better and live longer and happier lives.  As the Deputy rightly put it, trying to flip the manner in which funding is directed is a mammoth task.  Unfortunately, one cannot just whip money from acute or hospital services.  One must play a steady game by increasing funding in one direction while gradually decreasing it in another when it is no longer needed.  That is when we will start to see a change.  The five to ten-year plan for health is the way forward.  We must invest over a long period.  In the meantime, the priority is to continue increasing the finances for home help services, home care and intensive care packages.  I am working on this issue with the advocacy and support groups, carers and hospitals.  I will also work on it with the Deputy and ask for his and the support of every Deputy, as this is an important issue.  The number of people aged 65 years and over will double in the coming years, while the number aged 80 years and over will quadruple.  We will face a major problem if we do not address the issue now.</p></speech>

At University Hospital Galway we are blessed with a team of world-class doctors and health care professionals, but they are struggling beneath the weight of inadequate resources and unmanageable demand.  As the Minister of State will be abundantly aware, the hospital is beset with the country's longest waiting list, has the most cancelled procedures and frequently has the most patients on trolleys.  In the Minister's defence and that of his predecessors, it is not the case that no money has been made available for capital spending on the hospital in recent years, but in times of scarcity it is equally important to consider how money is spent, as well as how much.</p>  <p>  The central government funding invested in capital projects at University Hospital Galway in recent years represented a wasted opportunity.  The hospital campus has dated facilities and its capacity to cater for the needs of a growing and ageing population cannot be expanded owing to restrictions on its current site.  I will cite two of the most recent capital projects to illustrate this point.  </p>  <p>  This year will see the opening of a new 75-bed ward block.  For some time, this prospect gave people in the hospital's catchment area hope that it would go some way towards alleviating the seemingly perpetual overcrowding crisis.  However, it emerged in recent months that there were three wards being closed to make way for the new &euro;18 million block and that there would be no net increase in bed capacity once the block's doors opened.  This was confirmed in letters from the chief operations officer to the planning authority, in a letter to me from the hospital's general manager and in briefings by senior management of the group's patient council.  A key reason for this is that the additional beds cannot be provided under the terms of the city development plan without creating an equal number of car parking spaces, for which there is no room on the campus.</p>  <p>  That brings me to the second capital project.  The hospital undertook to build a new two-storey parking facility on the site of an existing car park a few years ago.  Remarkably, the project's net impact following completion was that there were 80 fewer spaces.  We are building car parks that do not result in the creation of extra parking spaces and ward blocks that do not result in the provision of extra beds.</p><p>We need to stop this, take stock of why this is happening and decide what should happen next.</p> <p> Given the gravity and scale of the overcrowding crisis at University Hospital Galway, I consider it a shame that scarce resources were poorly utilised on capital projects that would offer no respite from the crisis.  It is one thing in the midst of an economic crisis to say there is no money but it is quite another to have the money and waste it in a way that would do anything other than confer the maximum possible benefit on the maximum number of people.  That, I fear, is what has come to pass in the two instances I have outlined today.</p> <p> The present set of circumstances is not tenable.  Put simply, the region&rsquo;s population is going to grow but the hospital&rsquo;s capacity is going to remain the same.  The sooner we realise that a longer-term vision is required in the form of a new facility on the grounds of Merlin Park University Hospital, which is on State-owned land, the sooner we can restore confidence in the fact that the current and future health care needs of the people of the west will be catered for.</p> <p> Endemic short-termism appears to have overtaken most of the planning on the existing University Hospital Galway site.  Bearing in mind the Minister&rsquo;s vision and the setting up of the all-party Oireachtas committee, of which I am a member, to consider a ten-year plan for the health service, does the Minister of State agree that since University Hospital Galway is the major acute hospital for the west, we now need to grasp the nettle and look at the bigger picture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200028#AA00200"><p>I thank Deputy Naughton for raising this issue and I welcome this opportunity to outline the up-to-date position on recent health infrastructure developments at University Hospital Galway.  These developments recognise that demand for health care is rising, with our elderly population increasing at nearly double the European average.  Other factors, such as the rise in obesity, chronic disease and advances in health care technology, are also increasing demand for health services.  In this regard, A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a clear vision for health services that is community based and responsive and accessible to patients.  The development of primary care is central to this, by shifting the balance of care from a hospital-centric system to one located in the community, enabling users to access a broad spectrum of care services easily through their local primary care team.  The development of a new hospital anywhere in the county must be seen in the context of the delivery of related health care services in the locality and region.</p>  <p>  With regard to University Hospital Galway, the State has invested in the healthcare infrastructure at the hospital site and continues to do so.  Given the ongoing investment that has been made at the site, it would not represent value for money to walk away from this significant investment.  A number of significant projects have been completed at University Hospital Galway in recent years.  These include the clinical research facility, the upgrade to the maternity unit and the cystic fibrosis outpatient department, which was completed in 2014 and is now operational.</p>  <p>  There are also two major developments currently under way in Galway.  Construction work is ongoing on the new 75-bed ward block, which will provide single-room inpatient accommodation.  Work on a new acute mental health department is under way and is expected to be completed early in 2017.  Following the transfer of mental health services to the new acute department, work will begin on the construction of the project under the national plan for the radiation oncology, for which project the HSE has already obtained planning permission.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to progressing a new emergency department facility for Galway University Hospital.  The HSE Capital Plan 2011-2016 includes funding for a full option appraisal and cost-benefit analysis to inform planning and funding requirements for a new emergency department at University Hospital Galway.  The cost-benefit analysis is in its final stages and it is anticipated that this will be completed shortly.  If favourable, this will proceed to the design phase in 2016.  The building of this urgently needed emergency department remains a capital priority for the Saolta University Health Care Group.  Pending the development of a new emergency department, in order to alleviate pressures and to ensure that patient experience in the existing emergency department is improved, 30 additional beds opened at the hospital in early 2016.</p>  <p>  There are no plans for a new hospital to be built in County Galway.  Moreover, University Hospitals Galway comprises both University Hospital Galway itself and Merlin Park University Hospital, which is not far away.  The rationale behind the establishment of the hospital groups is to facilitate collaboration between hospitals serving a particular patient population and to maximise the utility of existing resources.  The Saolta University Hospital Group will continue to enable cross-development of both University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park to accommodate the best use and expansion of the services provided.</p>  <p>  Further investment in individual hospitals must be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme and as part of the establishment of hospital groups.  Development control plans have been completed on all major hospital campuses, including University Hospital Galway.  These provide a blueprint for future development and rationalise construction and capital expenditure.  This exercise focuses on what constitutes good practice, planning and addressing service needs, and all current and future development of health care infrastructure will be based on this considered approach.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the new 75-bed ward block will offer patients more modern single-room accommodation, but the simple fact is that it will not offer one single extra bed.  My point today is on value for money.  The Minister of State implied walking away from the University Hospital Galway site would not represent value for money.  If he investigates the amount of funding invested in the two projects I have outlined today, he will note it is an example of how we are not looking at the bigger picture or adopting a longer-term vision for Galway and the western region.</p>  <p>  Questions need to be asked on whether these projects should have been allowed to proceed when it was apparent that they would not bring any appreciable relief in the current crisis in University Hospital Galway.  Prior to my election to this House, I stated the University Hospital Galway campus was at saturation point and was unfit to provide for the present and future health care needs of people along the western seaboard.  I examined the Merlin Park site, which is State-owned.  We have Merlin Park hospital, as the Minister of State said.  Since the time in question, the assessment has gained the support not only of my political colleagues but also that of the clinicians and hospital management.  In the interest of the future health care of our citizens in the west, we need to be considering a plan and phasing out from University Hospital Galway.  I appreciate the investment in that site but we need to be considering a larger one.  The current one is in the city centre.  It is hemmed in and, because of parking restrictions associated with the Galway city development plan, we cannot have an extra bed without an extra car-parking space.  That is simply the case and we need to be considering the use of the State-owned land at Merlin Park.  We also need to consider the ten-year plan and include a provision whereby University Hospital Galway would move to Merlin Park as part of that plan.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Deputy welcomed the 75-bed single-room unit.  Of course, we must examine how we spend capital funding.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a very positive point on the problems with the city development plan and the car-parking issue.  I am listening to the points she has raised.  She is saying the clinicians on the ground support her position on this matter.  We have a duty to listen to the people who run the services and the service providers.  I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.</p>  <p>  I know University Hospital Galway very well because I spend a lot of time there visiting relations and extended family members.  I know of the problems with patients on trolleys and the other issues.  Our job is to try to come up with sensible proposals.  However, part of our job, which the Deputy rightly highlights, is to determine how we spend the money to provide services on the ground.</p>  <p>  We must recognise that chronic disease management is a major driver of health care costs.  It accounts for 80% of health expenditure.</p><p>The number of people affected by chronic conditions is increasing by approximately 5% annually.  We must address this issue.  <br/><br/>I will convey to the Minister the issues and concerns raised by the Deputy and we will ascertain whether anything can be done about them.  As I stated, we all have a duty to listen to citizens, local representatives and the professionals on the front line. </p></speech>

Over the weekend, people will have read astonishing revelations concerning executives in the St. John of God organisation who were paid &euro;1.64 million.  Some of the individuals in question received &euro;50,000, while others received &euro;250,000.  I worked for St. John of God services for two and a half years, during which I met the best, most dedicated and fantastic people I have every worked with.  I also met many fantastic family members of service users and the experience put me in good stead.</p>  <p>  There is something rotten about these revelations.  The chief executive of St. John of God services is paid &euro;182,000 per annum or six times more than the average worker in the organisation.  When one delves into the issue, one is shocked by what one discovers.  St. John of God services, which received &euro;130 million last year, signed a service level agreement which states that the organisation must not pay or subsidise salaries or expenses which exceed those normally paid within the public sector.  There is something rotten when the chief executive of a voluntary body such as St. John of God services is paid such an extraordinary amount of money when the service level agreement stipulates that no member of staff in the organisation should be paid more than &euro;110,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Why is taxpayers' money being allocated to St. John of God services when its executives are being paid such extraordinary amounts?  Taxpayers subsidise the health service and the voluntary bodies working in the sector.  What does the Government propose to do about this issue?  Action must be taken because the problem is not confined to St. John of God services.  The same issue arose regarding the Central Remedial Clinic and Rehab in recent years.  Having worked in the service, I believe many people will be enraged by recent developments, especially given recent cutbacks in St. John of God services, for example, the closure of St. Raphael's unit in Celbridge.  It is outrageous that this has been allowed to happen.  I hope the Minister of State will respond.</p></speech>

It is great to hear different and new voices raising important issues, particularly with regard to services for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  It is important to outline what has taken place thus far in order that we can address the specific issues that have arisen.  In June 2012, the Health Service Executive's internal audit undertook a review of the remuneration paid by section 38 agencies, bodies funded by the HSE pursuant to section 38 of the Health Act 2004, to their senior management.  The audit identified significant key findings and the overall assessment of the control environment was considered to be seriously inadequate due to the significance of the issues identified.  I understand the HSE was only very recently made aware of the payments by the St. John of God Hospitaller Order to 14 of its senior managers in 2013.  On foot of the review, the Health Service Executive wrote to the order to inform it that the HSE's internal audit has been requested to undertake a review of the payment of additional remuneration to St. John of God senior managers and request the organisation&rsquo;s full co-operation throughout the process. </p>  <p>  A review of all section 38 providers by external consultants is already under way.  The purpose of these reviews is to establish the standard of governance in place in these organisations and to confirm independently that the governance practices and procedures accord with those set out in their respective annual compliance statements.  These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that internal financial controls and formal written financial procedures are in place in these organisations.  We need to engage in reform and act on these matters.  Six reviews are under way and their outcomes will inform the HSE's relationship with the agency concerned and any further enhancement of the HSE's overall governance framework.</p>  <p>  On 27 September 2013, the Department issued to the HSE a health sector pay policy, Circular 1112013, which reflected Government pay policy as it applies across the public service.  The circular was prepared following consultations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Health consolidated salary scales, as sanctioned by the Minister for Health, set out the current salaries for the public health service.  The health sector pay policy states that the health consolidated salary scales must be strictly adhered to and in no circumstances should an employee receive remuneration in the nature of pay and allowances of an amount greater than the amount prescribed.  It is made very clear that this pay policy applies to all employees of the HSE and agencies funded by the HSE, in whole or in part, under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  It is also made clear that section 38 funded agencies may not supplement approved rates of remuneration with Exchequer funding or non-Exchequer sources of funding.</p>  <p>  Each section 38 provider is required to furnish to the HSE an annual compliance statement in which it is required to confirm, among other matters, that all remuneration paid to employees is in accordance with public health sector pay policy and that other sources of funding are not being used to supplement employee remuneration that exceed Department of Health consolidated salary scales and pension arrangements.  Financial penalties may be imposed by the HSE for non-compliance.  The health sector pay policy states that where an organisation wishes to make a business case for the continuation of unsanctioned salaries or allowances, it may do so and this will be considered by the HSE, with the involvement of the Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as necessary.</p></speech>

This issue raises a question which is depressing in some ways.  From where did St. John of God get the sum of &euro;1.64 million to pay 14 of its senior managers?  If it was not provided by the Health Service Executive, it must have been raised by service users' families, as occurs in many voluntary services, through sponsored walks, organised cake sales and so forth.  It is very difficult to raise funds these days, yet family members have provided funding to pay a salary of &euro;180,000.  The chief executive and other executives who were paid bonuses should resign.  I will be careful in my use of language but these people have no shame.  No one can justify paying such high salaries, particularly in an organisation such as St. John of God.</p>  <p>  As I stated, I worked in St. John of God services for many years and it is a great organisation with an amazing staff who provide a fantastic service.  The revelations we have heard are unbelievable.  I hope the loophole that allowed these payments to be made will be closed.  The bigger issue, however, is that the payment of salaries of &euro;90,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;110,000 to executives in voluntary organisations does not sit well with people.  No one is worth such a salary.  Ordinary workers in hospitals and other parts of the health service work hard in difficult jobs for a fraction of the pay awarded to managers.</p><p>There is something very wrong in this industry and I hope it can be addressed in the coming period.</p></speech>

I also believe we have to change the mindset with regard to services for people with disabilities.  We have to start talking about it.  Part of my vision as the new Minister of State with responsibility in this area is to deal with the whole idea of rights and equality for people with disabilities.  We want to get away from the charity idea.  These are our family members, children, neighbours and friends.  More than 600,000 people in the State have someone with an intellectual or physical disability in the family or have a disability themselves.  Most of them pay their taxes every day and many of them are working.  By the way, not enough of them are working but that is another debate for another day.  However, they are contributing to the Exchequer and they are entitled to a service.  We need to get away from the charity model.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kenny has raised these issues and it really annoys me when we see what is actually going on.  He referred to &euro;1.64 million.  Let us consider the vast amount &euro;1.64 million could do for services.</p>  <p>  There is another issue that I am concerned about.  This year in the Estimates, St. John of God services is going to get &euro;132.4 million from the taxpayer, the Exchequer.  We need to clean up the services.  We need to ensure that the money is spent on the services, including on occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  We need to deal with the issue of excessive pay.  Of course, it is wrong and I will not accept it.  As far as I know, senior managers from St. John of God will be before the Committee of Public Accounts this coming Friday.  That is where our colleagues should ask the hard questions.</p>  <p>  However, I am giving a commitment today.  Part of my plan and strategy in the coming months is to try to reform, clean up and point out the services that are good.  I have come across some great services recently.

It is nice to see him as a Deputy representing his constituency.  He has a question for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the future development of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour and the recently developed plans of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  He has four minutes to put his question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200030#CC00500"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his kind words and the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour is very dear to me.  I have been a resident and a native of D&uacute;n Laoghaire for almost 72 years and I know the harbour backwards.  I was also Minister for the Marine and Minister for Defence in the mid-1990s when we put through the Harbours Bill, which is now the Harbours Act.  The legislation incorporated a new way of managing D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, that is, through a State-owned company with a board of directors.</p>  <p>  Since that time, people have had other ideas about what should or should not be done with D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour.  This is a valuable and quality national harbour, as are the facilities attaching to it.  Anyone who takes a walk out there on a Sunday afternoon will see thousands of people walking the piers.  It was infamous from the days of the mail boat and dating back to when kings and queens landed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire on their way to visit Dublin city.  Its history speaks for itself.</p>  <p>  That is all very well but we now have a harbour company that does not know where it is going because people have been changing their minds - I do not include the current Minister in these comments because he has only recently taken over.  I sincerely hope he concurs with my view, that is, that the harbour company should remain as it is.</p>  <p>  The harbour is a valuable asset.  It had the potential to produce well in excess of &euro;10 million in revenue every year.  Unfortunately, however, because of the demise of the Stena ferry, revenue is now hovering at approximately &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million.  There is hope that the harbour will attract another carrier in the not too distant future, perhaps next year.  Those involved are also developing plans for cruise ships to visit D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour because of the massive development that has taken place in Dublin Port.  Thankfully, because of the economy, business in Dublin Port is increasing on a daily basis.  Therefore, harbours like those at Drogheda and D&uacute;n Laoghaire have become valuable assets.</p>  <p>  Two important issues arise.  The first is the management of the future of the harbour.  I am making this suggestion to the Minister because I believe it is such a valuable asset and not because I was the person who put through the legislation, together with my colleague, a former T&aacute;naiste.  The idea that it would be put into the hands of the local authority is questionable.  Frankly, the local authority does not have the expertise to manage harbours, especially commercial harbours that can produce revenues on that scale.  Specific expertise in managing the various facilities is needed, whether they are leisure facilities or commercial facilities.  The Stena port area can be developed for leisure, commercial and residential facilities.  That part of the harbour does not interfere with the normal day-to-day walking tourist in the area.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister look into the whole question of title?  This arises from the transfer of the harbour to the harbour company.  As the Minister with responsibility at the time, I understood that all the assets, including the title of the buildings and the foreshore, would automatically transfer to the harbour company.  Now, apparently, there is a dispute over whether some of the developments put in place for the ferry service are, in fact, the property of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the basis of the Foreshore Act.  The title issue is most important.</p>  <p>  Second, will the Minister once and for all establish the future of the harbour company in order that we are not left wondering where it is going to end up?  Will it end up as part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or with another port company?  That is the purpose of my requesting the forbearance of the Minister this afternoon.</p></speech>

I presume it is the first one he has raised on this side of the House.  Indeed, he must consider himself lucky to have been selected as I imagine he now realises how lucky those of us were whose matters were selected by him over the years.</p>  <p>  I have the same affection as Deputy Barrett for D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour and for D&uacute;n Laoghaire because I used the harbour as a child, as he did, and I lived in the constituency for many years as well.  Nothing would please me more than to see it restored to commercial prosperity or to see the activities which used to exist return, such as the mail boat.  However, at the moment, as the Deputy has so well outlined, many of those activities have ceased for commercial reasons.  Therefore, the harbour company and others, including the local authority and my Department, have been looking at ways of adapting to the changes that have taken place.  I realise they are not satisfactory to everyone.  Indeed, I believe there has been a good case made for both sides.  Ultimately, however, if there is not a commercial future for D&uacute;n Laoghaire in the old ways, the ways of the ferries and freight, then we have to look for new ways to bring it into a profitable and environmentally-friendly state.</p>  <p>  In recent years, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company has been restructuring its business to keep it on a sustainable financial footing and to enable the harbour to develop and operate on a commercial basis in future.</p><p>The port continues to face a challenging financial and operating environment as it transitions from commercial shipping activities, with the cessation of the Stena Line service, towards a different model which is more focused on marine leisure and marine-related tourism, while it prepares for transfer to the local authority.  The company has been pursuing a twin strategy of developing alternative income streams from marine leisure and tourism-related business, while also reducing its high cost base.<br/><br/>The D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour master plan, published in 2011, identified the need to develop strategies to ensure the long-term future of the harbour in view of the declining importance of ferry traffic at that time.  Since then, Stena Line has withdrawn its ferry service from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  Stena Line had operated the <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i>since 1996 during which time the vessel carried a mixture of passengers, car and coach traffic.<br/><br/>After the withdrawal of duty-free shopping, passenger and car volumes declined dramatically and, by 2014, fewer than 150,000 ferry passengers travelled through D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  This represented a decline of over 90% in volume.  This, combined with increasing fuel and operating costs, made the route unsustainable.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is seeking alternative providers to operate a seasonal service on the route.  A call for expressions of interest in operating this service has issued on eTenders.  It is hoped that a replacement passenger service might be possible at some stage in the future.  The departure of Stena Line adds to the future challenges for the company.  The financial impact on the port is significant and it is clear the company now faces a very different financial and operating environment than it faced previously.<br/><br/>The possible development of the cruise business was identified as one of the opportunities to be pursued in the master plan.  A cruise stakeholder group was established, comprising the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Business Improvement District.  The harbour company prepared a business case for the construction and operation of a cruise facility.  This study advised that the optimum method of expanding the cruise business into Dublin Bay was to construct a dedicated cruise berth that would be capable of taking vessels greater than 300 m and preferably being able to accommodate next-generation cruise ships at 339 m.  The study estimated the cost of a new cruise berth of this size would be approximately &euro;15 million to &euro;18 million.  The expansion and development of the cruise business would undoubtedly offer significant economic benefits to the port and the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Since 2011 some progress has been made in attracting cruise business.  In 2013, eight vessels in excess of 300 m visited the port for the first time, while four smaller vessels also came alongside.  Six cruise ships visited D&uacute;n Laoghaire in 2014, eight in 2015 and up to eight cruise calls are expected this year.</p></speech>

The management of the harbour is the point at issue.  With the greatest of respect to the local authority, I do not believe that the skills are available within the local authority structure to manage a vital asset such as this.  The harbour company, if proper directors who know their business are appointed, can see to the future development of this harbour in a proper regulated fashion.</p>  <p>  I was involved in the development of the harbour's marina, which is probably one of the best marinas in Europe at the moment.  It is full.  It was developed through public funds.  We supplied the funds for the inner harbour to protect the waters and as a result the ordinary individual in a small boat can sail safely within the harbour.</p>  <p>  There is also the possibility of developing a diaspora centre, which is an attractive proposition for an area like D&uacute;n Laoghaire with its history of emigration from and immigration into Ireland.</p>  <p>  The real point at issue here is not whether the revenue will be &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million, but that it be run properly and have a proper management structure with an independent board of directors who have the experience, can see the potential and can develop all of these things.</p>  <p>  We have been talking about a diaspora centre and future developments in other parts of the harbour.  These things are being spoken about, but nothing is happening because it is in limbo at the moment.  Now that we have a new Minister in place, I am asking him to make a decision once and for all as to the management structure for the future.  I recommend having a harbour company that is a limited company with professionals who know about marine issues on the board and who will see to the future development based on the potential of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p></speech>

There is a dispute about the ownership and future model for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  The problem has been the transition for the company, which may not have been able to respond fully and effectively to commercial conditions and the series of unfortunate events, particularly the withdrawal of the Stena Line service, which has forced it to make certain changes depending on tourism, maritime interests and other similar areas.</p>  <p>  The authorities are looking very carefully at the prospects for an international ports policy to insist that the ports and harbours exist in a competitive environment.  That obviously involves new commercial ventures such as accommodating cruise ships and other options in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which are already being explored.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the St. Michael's plaza project and the urban beach.  I gather there is even a proposal for a floating hotel in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  All these kinds of commercial projects should be investigated because they are good for the area and good for employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the ongoing challenge for the port will require sustained effort across a number of fronts.  This may even involve the sale of some non-strategic assets.  The company is examining a number of possible future projects and is exploring the concept of locating a floating hotel in the port - that is a ship permanently moored in the port operating as a hotel.  The company has recently informed my Department that it hopes to advertise on eTenders shortly for expressions of interest in this proposal.</p>  <p>  The ongoing viability of the company requires that a rigorous regime of cost control across all activities be applied and maintained, and that the viability of any proposed project must be examined thoroughly.  As outlined in the national ports policy published in 2013, the sustainable development of certain port companies is best placed within a local authority-led governance structure.  Under the policy, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, as a port of regional significance, is designated for transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p></speech>

That is the essence of the Bill.  All that amendments Nos. 11 to 15, inclusive, are doing is stating these are things the committee should also look at, which are clearly part of the process.  Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 relate to the suspension of water metering, which is not separate to the purpose of the Bill.  It clearly relates to the imposition of water charges.  If water meters go hand in hand with this I do not understand how it is separate.  I understand the Government may oppose it and that is fine, and I understand Fianna F&aacute;il may oppose it and that is fine, but I do not understand why we cannot debate it and vote on it.</p></speech>

It is very unfortunate these are the only amendments we are able to debate and that such a restrictive interpretation has been put on Standing Orders.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, which are linked, propose that the membership of the so-called expert commission, so-called neutral commission, would be subject to a vote in the House.  This is absolutely and perfectly reasonable.  Why does the Government not want to have a vote on it in the House?  I presume the Minister will speak to the amendment so let us see.  I think it is precisely because the purpose of the exercise was explained by Joe O'Toole, that people voted a certain way and Leinster House is not prepared to grasp that particular nettle, so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily.  The purpose is a political exercise to try to come back and reimpose the question of water charges as well as maintaining Irish Water.</p><p>The problem for Joe O'Toole, of course, was that he gave the game away.  That was the problem and why he had to go.  Ironically, I am sure the Minister has seen the interview Joe O'Toole gave <i>The Irish Times</i>on Saturday.  He gave the game away again, as he was asked whether the Minister for housing, planning and local government, Deputy Simon Coveney, knew of his views in advance.  Joe O'Toole said he told him what they were and that the Minister showed great confidence in him.  I would say the Minister did.  Did he tell the Minister that his view was that the purpose of the commission was a political exercise to put sugar on it to make sure the medicine goes down easily?  The game was given away yet again.  The commission is rigged in my opinion.  It has been set up to deliver a certain outcome, which is to recommend a continuation of domestic water charges.  It is a complete sham.</p><p>Let us look at the membership of the committee.  Obviously, we have seen that Joe O'Toole has been replaced by Kevin Duffy.  So what?  The Minister could replace him with anyone in the world.  He could replace him with Kofi Annan and it would not change the essence of it.</p></speech>

Another is Gritta Nottelman, a strategy consultant with Waternet, a Dutch water company that charges for tap water and the discharge of wastewater.  Another is Bill Emery, a former director of Ofwat, the British regulatory authority that presided over a privatised water system.</p>  <p>  The essence of the amendment, and it is fair enough that the Bill refers to the committee although I do not personally think that was clear, is that the expert commission should be subject to a vote in the Oireachtas and in the D&aacute;il.  It is absolutely clear.

First, we are on Report and Final Stages of this short piece of legislation.  There was an opportunity to debate many of the issues that Deputies Murphy, Coppinger and Smith raised on Second Stage.  That is why we had a Second Stage.  There was a further discussion on Committee Stage during which a number of these issues were raised, so the suggestion that this issue has not been debated and discussed is nonsense.  It has been debated and discussed.  Questions have been submitted to me also regarding the suspension of metering, to which I gave very clear answers, but that is not what is in the legislation that we are talking about.</p>  <p>  Second, since the commission has been raised, I reiterate for the benefit of the House that we are setting aside a nine-month period during which charging will be suspended and we will essentially freeze the process to create a space for work to be done on how we proceed.  In the first five months of that nine-month period, an expert commission will be set up, which is not dealt with in the legislation but was agreed to in terms of the setting up of that commission.  That commission will make recommendations and report-----</p></speech>

We have not specified the terms of reference <i>per se</i>for everything and all the work that the committee of the House will do.  </p><p>In regard to the two amendments that are in order, the first one, amendment No. 8, tabled by the Anti-Austerity Alliance and People Before Profit, proposes to prevent the establishment of an Oireachtas committee tasked with making recommendations on the funding of water services provided to dwellings from being established until after the enactment of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016.

In other words, it seeks to restrict the membership of that committee solely to members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and not Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

It is up to the House how and when to set that committee up and the composition of it.  There is plenty of time to do that and it is catered for in the legislation by referring to a committee set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Amendment No. 8 is, therefore, not necessary.  That committee, as I said, has plenty of time to be set up and will be representative of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  In regard to amendment No. 9, I do not understand why the Deputies want to prevent Senators from being on that Oireachtas committee.</p></speech>

This is the purpose of these amendments.  It is very clear.  It does not, as the Minister suggested, exclude Senators.  It says the composition of the committee should be decided by the D&aacute;il.  This is in line with an argument which the Minister fully understands and which he should not try to misrepresent, namely, that we believe the House is mandated on the question of water charges and it is an abuse of democracy for anybody other than the directly elected representatives of the House to decide how the issue of water charges is dealt with.</p>  <p>  We think there is a clear, democratic mandate and that the Minister is trying to worm his way out of it with Fianna F&aacute;il.  We do not accept that expert groups or committees, established to make recommendations to the House, should be established by any other body than the House.  This is what democracy means.  It is clear that the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il do not like democracy when it does not suit them.  With these amendments, we are trying to rectify an abuse of the democratic principle.  Our amendments do not specify that the House cannot select Senators.  The House can choose whomever it wants to put on commissions or committees.  This is what we are arguing and the Minister knows damn well it is what we are arguing.</p>  <p>  We do not think it is acceptable that the Minister is establishing a process that will, over time, undermine the clear and unequivocal mandate that was given to the House because of a side deal he happens to have done with Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Minister should respond to this point.  The public needs to know how the game is played.  It should not be a game but it is a game.  When the Government cannot win a matter in open public debate, it rigs the game by way of side deals between different political parties.</p></speech>

I am telling you that the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the rigging of the game.  The legislation the Government has proposed is open to the game being rigged.  We are attempting to insert an amendment that would prevent the game being rigged.  It is entirely relevant to the purpose of the legislation unless the Government wants to tell us it would not be worried about the game being rigged.  However, I am sure, in the new political landscape, the Government would be as concerned as we are about the possibility of games being rigged.  As we all know, games have been rigged for a long time on many issues.  Given that it would be deviating from the Bill to enumerate them, I will not.</p></speech>

I will speak directly to the two amendments that deal with the establishment of the committee.  On Committee Stage last week, an amendment was passed at the instigation of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputy Barry Cowen is being very quiet and has not proposed any amendments on Report Stage because he got his amendment through Committee Stage, given that the Government tabled a similar amendment.  The amendment allowed for an extension of the time taken by the committee and the commission beyond the nine months.  As a publicly elected person in the Chamber, I believe we are being asked to finalise the Bill today without the kind of information we need for the taxpayers who will have to pay if infringement charges are imposed and if those infringement charges are increased by the provision in the legislation to extend the time period beyond nine months.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister went to Brussels and met Commissioner Karmenu Vella.  We do not know the consequences of the meeting.  We do not know if there will be infringement charges and what they will be.  We do not know if they are likely to increase due to amendments to the Bill.  We should not make such a decision in the absence of this information.  The Minister was very helpful on Committee Stage last week and spoke about the fact that he was going to meet the Commissioner.  However, since then, we have received no information about what happened.  While it goes against the grain for the Minister, he must do it given that he is in a minority Government.  It is being done at the instigation of Fianna F&aacute;il, the very party which decided we were to have water charges in the first place, back in 2010 under the river basin management plan to which the Fianna F&aacute;il Government agreed.</p></speech>

If not, the Minister may request it.  Based on that and the replies the Commissioner has given to various MEPs in the recent past and, dare I say it, once the Minister outlines to us the discussions he had last week, it will be clear that this situation is a sham.  There is a predetermined outcome, because the equation here is very simple.  I have stated it on numerous occasions.

However, this legislation is being proposed despite what the Commission has said and the replies of Commissioner Vella to various MEPs.  These replies were quite clear and distinctive and replies from Commissioners are not always distinctive.  He was very clear and absolute in his opinion.  We now have a situation where this committee will be left in a scenario that has a predetermined outcome given the legal situation and we have a Minister putting forward this legislation.

As everybody is aware, the purpose of the Bill is to suspend the payment ofwater charges for nine months.  The purpose of the suspension is to allow a so-called independent commission to consider the funding of domestic water services, refer its recommendations to an Oireachtas committee which will make recommendations to the D&aacute;il for a final decision.</p>  <p>  The frustration of the Deputies who tabled these two amendments stems from the fact that there has been no opportunity for the House to debate fully or influence the membership of the commission, or its terms of reference.  The considerations of the committee will automatically be limited by this fact.  We did not have on Committee Stage a considered discussion of the terms of reference or the membership of the commission.  Because of this, all the committee will be able to do is debate recommendations which will be very narrowly framed.  Admittedly, we will be able to throw other things in, but they will already have been narrowed.  The original proposition the Minister made when he introduced the Bill was that the purpose was to take the heat out of the debate and allow for a full and frank discussion of all the issues involved, but that is not what will happen.  I, therefore, support the two amendments.  I would not have written them in the way they have been drafted, but since I did not make the effort to write amendments and others did, I will support them.  I still urge the Minister to reconsider the proposals made by my colleagues and I to include issues for the consideration of the commission and the committee such as water poverty and the others laid down in order that we can have a full discussion.</p>  <p>  While the issue of imminent fines is not related to the amendments, as a number of other speakers have addressed it, I would also like to address it.  People keep talking about the provision of legal advice.  If they have it, they should publish it and if they are not willing to do so, they should stop telling us what the anonymous legal advice is.  All we are getting is conjecture.  Anybody who understands how European law works knows that the Water Framework Directive has five core objectives and that if there were to be infringement proceedings taken by the European Commission, they would be on the basis of whether the Government of this member state was in breach of these objectives, of which the introduction of domestic water charges is not one.  The river basin management plan will provide the outline of how the Government intends to meet the five objectives and only if the Commission, post publication of the plan in 2017, considers it does not meet its objectives will it even consider taking infringement proceedings.  Even if it were to do so, it would take two, three or four years for it do so because there are already infringement proceedings under way for a breach of a previous directive, the urban wastewater directive, as the Minister noted.  Anybody who comes into the House and alleges that there will be imminent and enormous fines because of this Bill is making it up.  Anybody with an ounce of sense and knowledge of EU law, the Water Framework Directive and infringement proceedings knows this is the case.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has commissioned legal advice on this issue and, unlike others, when it is available, we will publish it because we think the public has a right to know what the legalities are.  However, in the meantime I urge the Minister, notwithstanding the difficulties with the wording of the amendments, to take on board their spirit, broaden the terms of reference of the commission in order that the committee will be able to consider key issues such as water poverty, water conservation and the others mentioned by colleagues.</p>  <p>  I also say to my colleagues that they should let the Bill get through tonight because whatever about our difficulties with what the Government is doing, we could then move to the next stage and deal with the more important issues that we all want to raise in the committee and ultimately on the floor of the D&aacute;il to end up taking a vote on the issue which I hope will result in the abolition of water charges.</p></speech>

It is obviously a key issue for the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit grouping and others in the House who took a very firm stand against water charges from the time of their imposition two years ago and encouraged people to organise and march to boycott them.  With all due respect to Deputy Barry Cowen - it is nothing personal - we are not here because of him but because tens of thousands of people took to the streets and made water charges such a massive issue when politicians knocked on the door and also did not pay them, despite all the threats made.</p>  <p>  The political establishment and the political system has been discredited enough without the actions being taken in the Bill.  I am a member of the committee which deals with the issues of housing, water services and the environment.  I was shocked at the way everything was ruled out of order without any discussion.  Effectively, an attempt was being made to confine and narrow the scope of this process and also the idea behind having a committee versus a commission.  A commission is being set up that has never been agreed to in the D&aacute;il but it was agreed to somewhere else, in a secret room, between the two major parties represented in the D&aacute;il.  The rest of the D&aacute;il has no say in who will be included in it or represented on it.  That is completely undemocratic.  There should be some oversight.  From what I see, it will be dominated by people who are involved in the water industry.  Will there be any householder included in it - any mother or father who has to pay water bills - or anyone from Detroit suffering from water poverty to give evidence?  Will there be any such representative included in it?</p><p>They did not have anything like that.</p></speech>

It is clear how the water committee the Government is going to set up in the D&aacute;il will go.  It will be able to discuss nothing except what the Minister wants it to discuss.  It cannot discuss water meters or any of the issues preying on people's minds in regard to water charges.</p></speech>

The commission is clearly weighted with people from the water industry.</p>  <p>  The second threat being used, and it seems to be the Labour Party taking up the cudgels on this one, is the EU Commission.  It is as clear as day that this country has never had an established practice of charging for water.  We have had an established practice of not charging for water.  How can any Member cite such rubbish?  He or she is meant to be defending the so-called country or the wishes of the people in this country against the EU but is instead using it as a hammer against the anti-water charges movement.  One would be a sad and poor lawyer if one could not make the case that Ireland did not have an established practice of charging for water.</p>  <p>  Not just that, but the other wording used is "recouping the charge for water".  We have never recouped the charge for water through charges.  Irish Water was a fiasco.  It never worked.  A law student could argue the case that we never recouped water charges.  Nevertheless, this is the big bogeyman now.  First, it was a proposal to dock the charge from people's wages.  Now, it is fines from Europe.</p>  <p>  How does the Minister propose to reintroduce charges for water after nine months?  I lie awake at night wondering about this one because I do not envy the Minister.  The first car I ever owned was a banger of a Ford Fiesta.  It had a choke.  I doubt the Minister has ever driven a car like this as he might come from more salubrious surroundings.</p></speech>

The Deputy might want to listen.  When the engine got very cold, one pulled the choke to allow more petrol into it, but often flooded the engine instead.  I do not envy the Minister and his new Government in trying to reintroduce water charges after nine months.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of emphasis on mental health in the programme for Government.  It should let this issue go now.  Do not cling on to it.  The people have no intention of restarting payment for water.  We saw the figures earlier and that 73% of people are not paying.  That includes the middle class on whom the Minister relies for his votes.  They have now joined the boycott.  They have seen the example of those who held the line from the outset and they are not going to start repaying.  The Minister can set up any charade of a commission he likes.  I am just finishing Acting Chair, as I would not filibuster.</p></speech>

We all know that no matter what the Government comes up with, people have decided that they are not paying and that water charges are finished.  On 17 September, there will be another protest.  I do not know how big it will be.  I doubt it will be as large as the ones which took place in October 2014.  I warn the Minister, however, that if he keeps up with this kind of thing, the protests will grow again.  This is the one issue where people have confidence that they are in control because they can refuse to pay.  The boycott is central to winning this, and not Fianna F&aacute;il or anyone else who is trying to get over this hurdle.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has left the Chamber.  He and the previous Minister and now EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, left us in a mess in setting up Irish Water, which I oppose fundamentally.  However, I have huge difficulties with the amendment.  We had a referendum on the Seanad and this seems to deny the people elected and appointed to the Seanad by the will of the people a chance to consider the legislation.  The Seanad remains.  As such, people that shout a lot about democracy are trying to deny it to both Houses.  Both Houses debate legislation here.  There is also the fact that in the region of 700,000 people paid for water.  I inform Deputy Coppinger who says that we have no history of charging and paying for water that rural people have been paying for water all their lives.  Many of them never had it.  I did not have it as a young fellow and I am not 100 years old.  We had to draw it with all sorts of vehicles, including horses and cars, from wells and everywhere else.</p></speech>

I salute the pioneers of the group schemes who went out and championed their own water, sought funding and paid to bring water services to their houses.  They were very glad of it.</p>  <p>  There is a big debate about what the European Commission has said and that the Exchequer funds having to pay for it, which is what Deputy Alan Kelly ensured.  What about the private people?  Every hairdresser, every shop, every victualler, every church and everywhere else with a water connection, including private homes, are all paying for water.  Private businesses of every sort are paying for water.  Are they going to be left to carry the can?</p>  <p>  We want to support jobs.  Someone is going to have to pay the bills to break even on the cost of upgrading our many schemes.  Is it the farmers and ordinary small business people who will be crucified?  Do they matter at all?  Should they just pay the rates, pay for everything, shut up and carry the can for somebody who does not want to pay for anything?  We have to have some reality here. There is talk about the 90 Members elected here because of water, but it was not really an issue in my election campaign in Tipperary.

I believe in paying one's fair share.  I do not believe Irish Water should have been set up.  It led to the creation of a monster.  It was unnecessary because of the local authorities, God be good to them, and the private pioneers who found sources, developed water schemes and are still running them.  They have to pay.</p>  <p>  Where is the fairness?  We talk about equality every day of the week until it is coming out our ears.  Where is the fairness when these people have to pay, which they do not mind, and when 700,000 Irish Water customers paid in spite of the intimidation and rumpus that went on around this?  We need a reality check before we get into too much hot water.  We will not know where we are going.  We must respect the establishment of the commission.  I do not have a view on it one way or another except to say that we should have kept the system we had and stood with the people who always paid and who do not mind paying their share.</p><p>They are in this city as well.  Every business premises has to pay for it, from the smallest one-person shop and the little cafeteria across the road where we get our bowls of porridge in the morning if we are here early to whatever.  What is so great about people not wanting to pay for anything?  I rest my case.</p></speech>

They should have been abolished in a democratic acceptance of what the people had been saying for two years.  On 26 February, people went out with their pencils in their hands and voted in the majority of Deputies to abolish water charges.  That message to the Government could not have been any clearer.  The Government could have played around with the idea that there were 50,000, 30,000 or 10,000 people on the streets for the water protests when we knew that there were 110,000, but the vote was a clear message to anyone setting up a Government to the effect that water charges had to go.</p>  <p>  We are back in a farcical situation.  Fianna F&aacute;il instigated water charges in the 1990s.  A Labour Party-Fine Gael Government abolished them after an election because it realised that the people had spoken.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il could have kept the door open for eventualities such as this one to allow it to abolish the water charges.  Terribly, the Labour Party followed through and bolted the door behind itself by signing off on the European Water Framework Directive.  It did this in the knowledge that the people had said that they did not want water charges.</p>  <p>  Farcically, establishment politicians and parties are playing a game and setting up a commission.  Opposition Deputies are right to point out to the Government that it is setting up a commission that we cannot change or into which we, as elected representatives, cannot make an input.  We do not know who made the decisions about who will be members of the commission.  A number of us have made proposals to broaden its terms of reference.  I received a letter from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in response and I thank him for acknowledging my proposal.  I wanted to broaden the terms of reference to cover the social implications of funding water services in the short, medium and long terms, including water poverty for low-income families, and possible future privatisation; the protection of public ownership of water, including its management and delivery; and the effect of borrowing to fund water infrastructure.  For example, Detroit in the USA was under significant pressure to repay its loans.  People were cut off from water, leading to water poverty and all that goes with it.  The human right to water, even at a low level of payment, is not being delivered to those people.</p>  <p>  I wanted the commission to consider how to increase water conservation through green technologies and to examine reports in Scotland, England, Bolivia and Germany on servicing water infrastructure and supply.  I also wanted the commission's membership to involve people with expertise in consumer rights, consumer interests and anti-poverty advocacy.</p>  <p>  The Minister has closed us down regarding the Bill and has not reverted to us in any shape or form on whether he is considering including any of our proposals in the terms of reference, broadening them out or doing whatever is necessary.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputy &Oacute; Broin proposed similar terms of reference to the Minister.</p>  <p>  People see that the water charges are dead but not buried whereas the establishment believes that a bit of sugar will soften people up to the idea of paying some form of water charge.  The real lesson that people have learned was highlighted by the privatisation of waste collection.  People know that water charges will lead to privatisation.  They know that once a commodity is made out of a service, the European Commission can insist on its privatisation and its opening to competition in line with EU regulations.  We are not fools.  The people who went out on the streets are not fools.  The people who will walk the streets on 17 September are not fools.  They will be out in large numbers to let the minority Government and Fianna F&aacute;il know that this is not acceptable.  We should forget about water charges and set them aside.  The Government will not get them.  People will resist them time and again.</p>  <p>  We will have an election soon.  We do not know whether it will be in nine, 18 or 26 months but Government Deputies will be back out on the doorsteps to face the electorate again.  People know that at least three of the commission's members support water charges.  I advise Deputies to think hard about what is happening and to abolish water charges.</p>  <p>  The Government points out that producing clean water for our taps must be paid for, which is important.  We all know that it costs money.  For the past ten or 15 years, however, green technologies that only provide clean water for what we drink were not included in our planning laws despite the possibility of this directive being implemented.  Why are we flushing clean water down toilets or into our washing machines and out into the system?  If the Government was serious, it would introduce grants to effect this change in water usage.  We would not be discussing this problem because the amount of water being used at our taps would be nearly 80% less.  We should be installing long-term infrastructure in our homes and communities so as to ensure that costly clean water only goes where it is meant to instead of down our toilets.  Until people see initiatives like that, they will not be fooled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-07-12a.830" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071200040#OO00500"><p>I must declare an interest.  My family has a small plant hire business that has been repairing and replacing water pipes for more than 60 years in Kerry.</p>  <p>  We all realise that water is essential and that without it, none of us can survive.  For various reasons, many parts of my county do not have water at certain times of the year.  They do not have pipes running in front of their homes, so they must improvise by, for example, drawing water.  One community in south Kerry must hire lorries and tankers to bring it water practically everyday from April until the middle or end of September.</p>  <p>  I hope that some geniuses decide in the coming months that it will be grand for everyone to have free water.  I would support that because I also would like to have free water but many people on group schemes in my county have been suffering trying to keep their schemes working, their water treated and their pipes repaired.  It costs money constantly to keep water flowing in those pipes.  Another set of people have wells, pumps and private supplies of their own but keeping the water coming into their homes costs money.  They must provide their own septic tanks but even before they can place those, people need to get planning permission for them, undergo site assessments and meet planners' strict regulations.  Some treatment systems can cost up to &euro;14,000 or &euro;16,000.  Many young couples have had to go through all of this recently to comply with the new standards and regulations.</p><p> People in group sewerage schemes experience a lot of trouble.  It costs a lot to enter the schemes at the outset.  I know of numerous communities around Killarney and the rest of Kerry seeking to have group sewerage schemes sanctioned but they may have to wait for three, four or five years.  They have been waiting for the past five years but there is no word that they will be assisted in this regard.</p> <p> Over the years, farmers and businesspeople have been paying continuously for water from the public supply.  They have been glad to get it.  The only trouble they have is when the water system breaks down.  They really start to complain when they do not have water.  They may be without it for only a short few hours but they need to get the supply restored as soon as possible.  Until they have the water back again, they are not happy, as everybody here can understand.</p> <p> If we are to have free water for all, all those people who have paid their charges up to now will have to be refunded.  Irrespective of what committee is to vet these proposals, it will have to consider that people in group water schemes, or with wells, pumps and septic tanks, and those in group sewerage schemes will have to be helped and subsidised.  Their group schemes will have to be brought up to standard, as will their wells, and they will have to be funded so there will be equality in all sections of society.</p> <p> There is much to be considered.  I would dearly love it if everybody could have free water, but I do not know how that would be achieved.  I have been repairing pipes myself over the years and noted water does not get into them without a lot of work and without someone ensuring they are maintained and repaired.  The water must be treated, which costs money.  Some people say water will be paid for through progressive taxation.  Maybe they are going to raise income tax, and maybe the people in the schemes I have been talking about will be asked to pay so others can have free water.</p></speech>

The one point that has been lost in all the debates over the past few months concerns the group water schemes, which suffered a cut of &euro;50 per household when the &euro;100 grant was introduced.  We now know the &euro;100 grant is gone and the group water schemes are struggling.  I acknowledge there is a commitment to addressing this in the programme for Government but I urge the Minister to do so urgently because the householders will soon be down &euro;50 per house for a year.  This is fundamental in keeping the group water schemes going.</p>  <p>  Over the past ten to 12 years, many EU regulations have come in on the supply of water and on the bar to which one must rise.  Whether we like it or not, be it on the right or left, it is costing more and more to supply water to a house.  This is because UV systems and new filter systems must be installed.  Regardless of what side of the debate one is on, it would be good for one to go to a sewage or water treatment plant to look at the sophisticated types of machinery now required to deliver safe water to houses.  I am chairman of a group water scheme and I am used to the different types of machinery needed.</p>  <p>  I have seen boil-water notices operating for ten years in certain areas.  We have moved on such that there are now new UV systems.  I have a container, like a spare wheel for a car, that one can move from one part of Ireland to another if there is a problem with cryptosporidium.  Admittedly, it takes ten or 12 months but it once took eight to ten years.  The period can be reduced even further.</p>  <p>  The group water schemes have been forgotten in this debate.  So, too, have the wells.  The Minister is responsible for planning.  A point currently emerging from planning authorities is that, in rural areas where people spend between &euro;4,000 and &euro;8,000 to sink a well for a new house, local authorities are stipulating, as a condition of planning permission, that if piped water comes along in two years or five years, for example, those people must connect up to it.  This is very unfair on somebody who has spent &euro;4,000, &euro;5,000 or, perhaps, &euro;8,000 to participate in a scheme.  This should be addressed ferociously quickly.</p>  <p>  Whether people like it or not, when the commission completes its work it will be for politicians or a committee to make a decision.  Regardless of what the D&aacute;il decides to do, the one thing we must know is the position on building sewage treatment plants right around this country.  In this regard, one should bear in mind that a lake I know that is supposed to be a special area of conservation has raw sewage flowing into it.  There are two EPA reports on the lake but the money has not been invested in solving the problem.  This is happening right around the country.</p>  <p>  Even at present, we are struggling to have water of the quality required because the bar is rising year by year.  If we are to have it, be it on the right hand or the left hand, we must put a fair bit of money aside.  We must also invest in fixing pipes that are leaking.  This needs to be sorted quickly because wasting water is no good to anybody.</p>  <p>  I have spoken time and again about rainwater harvesting initiatives to cut down on the supply of treated water.  I am a farmer and my cattle drink chlorinated water.  They should not.  There should be a separate way of harvesting water for such uses and an incentive from the Government to encourage people to move away from treating water that is not for human consumption.  One cannot have two pipes side by side so there needs to be an incentive for a separate tank or a system involving the eaves gutter on the house.  If there were a PVC tank and a little pump, the water could be collected for toilets, and it could also be used by farmers.  We need to think outside the box on this.  The Government should provide the incentives.  If water is being pumped from a well, electricity costs, chlorine costs, UV costs and other associated costs will reduce.  We could be much more economical in our use of treated water because we get plenty of water from the sky that could be collected if we introduced rainwater harvesting initiatives.</p></speech>

What is really disappointing is the charade that took place here for the first 20 minutes of this debate.  We are not even dealing with what we are actually trying to do here.  We are dealing with what is emotive, what will get a headline in the paper and what we can put in our Twitter and social media accounts rather than the facts before us.</p>  <p>  Deputy Coppinger said the debate was shut down at the committee meeting.  We dealt with this Bill on Committee Stage but, in fairness to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the conclusion of that Stage he afforded to members of the committee as much time as they wanted to ask questions, be they about the commission or the water bill.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, who is not a member, was present.  That discussion concluded only when there were no further questions from the floor.</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, at that meeting and another meeting on the Estimates, afforded members as much time as they wanted to debate the issues.<br/><br/>Some of the Deputies opposite obviously have access to a crystal ball because they appear to know the outcome of the commission's deliberations.</p></speech>

It is unfair to other Deputies to pre-empt the outcome of the commission and the subsequent decision of the committee.  Deputies should calm down and wait for the commission's report and the decision of the House.</p>  <p>  Housing is a priority for many Deputies and the Government.  If we are serious about building houses, the numerous sites that are not serviced with water must be serviced.  Since my election to the D&aacute;il in February, I have not heard any indication from some of the Deputies opposite as to how they propose to pay for this.  I would like them to clarify how it would be done, albeit not in this debate.</p>  <p>  I will provide some context to this issue.  Although the issue of water was raised in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown a few times during the election campaign, it was not a major issue in the constituency.  This was because we have been on top of the water issue from the outset.  We identified leaks, rectified problems and communicated with constituents.  While water may have been an issue in certain parts of the constituency, it was not an election issue and it was not the basis on which I was elected to the House.  I was elected to deliver for my constituents, whether in child care, housing, jobs or health and water was not the No. 1 issue.  We are serious about providing housing and value for money for people.  </p>  <p>  I do not have a problem waiting for the commission's report and allowing it to go before the committee.  Certain Deputies have lost the run of themselves.  They should be searching for life-jackets under their seats because we are drowning in what is coming from across the floor.  Let us deal with the amendments and the Bill, get the process under way and debate the issue at a later stage.  Let us deal with facts, not fiction, crystal balls, metaphors, frozen analogies and so forth.  The Deputies opposite should be dealing with facts and sticking to the point.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge one group of people because their efforts forced the previous Government into a U-turn on water charges.  I refer to ordinary people - I do not care if they were supporters of political parties or Independents - who carried their children through towns and villages on wet Saturday and Sunday mornings to express their opposition to the Government's proposals for water charges.  One could spend the rest of one's life debating the level of water charges or whether they should or should not be introduced but the fact is that the Government's original proposals on water charges would have imposed an unbearable financial burden on struggling families.  The outcome of the protests was that the Government was eventually forced to do a U-turn and reduce the charges.  The heroes of the water debacle were the people who voiced their concerns by protesting on the streets.</p></speech>

It changed its mind as a result of people power and I appreciate that because it showed the Government was wrong in trying to introduce such high water charges.  My message to those who protested day in and day out and weekend after weekend is a simple one: I thank them very much for being involved in this debate.</p>  <p>  The other side of the water issue is the future delivery of water.  Many farmers and business people have been paying water charges throughout their working lives.  I have been paying for water since I started a business at the age of 19 years, which was a few years ago at this stage.  These people must also be taken into consideration.  There must be balance and common sense in this debacle.  I appreciate the efforts made by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party before and after the general election.  All we are trying to do is arrive at some type of solution that ensures people have a safe water supply.  We should bear in mind members of group water schemes and people with private wells.  The latter must pay large amounts to bore a well and many of them face significant annual costs associated with the filtration systems that ensure the water they use is safe.  People who have children must have proper water supplies.</p>  <p>  I hope the outcome of this process will be that struggling families do not face unfair financial burdens.  This is a welcome and worthwhile debate and I hope it will deliver a successful outcome. </p></speech>

This short Bill gives effect to the agreement the Fianna F&aacute;il Party reached with the party opposite, which leads the Government, the purpose of which is to prepare and allow a pathway for dealing with the water issue in a way that allows proper scrutiny and analysis and informed debate on the process by which the State will, can or may pay for water services in future.  Deputy Alan Kelly, who was seated beside Deputy Jan O'Sullivan earlier, did not allow this during his time as Minister because he and the Government of the day rammed through legislation that caused the calamity that subsequently ensued.  Towards the end of the previous Government's term, Deputy Kelly then sought to take over this matter, yet he has the cheek and audacity to tell me I may be faced with a climb-down.  He is the king of climb-downs and nobody can surpass the excellence he has achieved in the area of climb-downs.  Apparently, nobody can surpass his knowledge of European Union directives either, although when he questioned the Commissioner with responsibility for this issue in 2010, he was given an answer with which he was satisfied because it suited his political objective of returning to the House.  That was an unfortunate development given what has ensued in the meantime.  That is the reason I kept my counsel.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, which were supported and written by the Government in parallel, was to correct the measure and have the suspension of water charges commence on 1 July and provide that the legislation would not be retrospective.  They also provided that the relevant committee would be afforded an opportunity to pass judgment on recommendations emanating from the commission and, if necessary, provide for an extension of time to ensure the scrutiny and analysis of the recommendations are informed and Deputy O'Sullivan and other Deputies are informed about them.  That privilege was not afforded by the Deputy and her colleagues in government to Deputies on this side. </p></speech>

We achieved more than 500,000 votes and we were glad to get them but it was not enough to lead a government.  It was not enough to be in government.  We honoured the commitment we made to the same 500,000 plus people when we said we would not go into coalition or form a coalition government with Fine Gael.  However, we were pragmatists, democrats and republicans.  We recognised the fact that as convoluted as the result was in respect of the return of the people and the figures it gave us, there was an obligation on those of us who partook and took our role seriously to seek to accommodate and facilitate the formation of a government.  We asked other Members to support us and our leader on three separate occasions and we got no support other than what we had ourselves.  We accept that.  However, we did not sit on our hands and shout from the sidelines, which is what many people in this House will always do.  The only way we will get them out of here is by doing things, by getting things done and by adhering to the principles, manifestoes and programmes for government that we place before the people.  When that is done this issue will be put to bed by a majority contained within this D&aacute;il.  The will of the last D&aacute;il will not be imposed on this one.  By not sitting on our hands and in putting in place the pathway to deal with this issue we have produced a far more informed process than the Labour Party could have dreamed of in the last D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  In the same way, we will also address the other issues that are far more pressing, as others have said, for example, in respect of housing, regional development and the provision of services in a fair and appropriate manner.  That has not been the case in the past five years.  That is the adjudication that people gave in the convoluted answer and result they gave us.  However, we have taken our role seriously.  We want to deal with this effectively and appropriately and in the manner agreed by two parties, the two adults, indeed, the many adults that were in that room who spoke on behalf of our respective parties.  We look forward to dealing with it and we look forward to this D&aacute;il making a decision ultimately.  However, it will be a decision nonetheless by this D&aacute;il and not by a government imposing its will on anyone else.</p></speech>

They have kicked to touch on bins, education equality and an investigation into NAMA.  They have done nothing on housing and they intend to do no more than those in government are doing.  They have similar policies to Fine Gael and they are absolutely and utterly similar on water charges.</p>  <p>  Those of us who marched and who built the protests against metering as well as the boycott know full well that what gave this issue the prominence it has in this House was the actions of the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of our citizens who marched, protested and voted in this direction.</p>  <p>  I will press the amendment on subsection (f).  There was a reference to the commission but obviously we are not going to have any say on the composition of that commission.  I have already spoken about it in the House and Deputy Murphy spoke about it earlier as well.  It is utterly loaded with people whose professions and histories are entirely in favour of water charges and the privatisation of water.  They include academics, scientists, professionals and ex-politicians.  That is disgraceful.  It is a kick in the teeth to every man, woman and child who marched in this country.  Shame on Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  </p>  <p>  However, I want to move the amendment formally-----</p></speech>

For the past three years, we have not been sitting on our hands.  We have been out doing the backbreaking work of organising and building the anti-water charges campaign.  It did not simply spring out of nowhere.  There were local meetings throughout the country.  They were well attended and a campaign was built up advocating the boycott, which most of the other parties in the D&aacute;il would not advocate, but it has proven to be absolutely instrumental.  That is what has brought us to this point.  It has nothing to do with sitting on our hands.  What we are doing now is representing that movement and the 73% of people who have opted not to pay.</p></speech>

I will try to do so quickly because otherwise will be back again dealing with this issue and there are only two amendments classified as being in order.</p>  <p>  A question was asked about conservation grants for rainwater harvesting and so on.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we had water harvesting grants available for farmers but few applied for them.  That may be different now given the debate on water since then and I suspect it is something the Minister responsible will explore.</p>  <p>  There was a question on group water schemes and wells.  We have made it absolutely clear and we have an agreement with the federation representing all the group water schemes throughout the country on the funding model they need.  Essentially, we are going back to the funding model that had been in operation previously, before the introduction of the water conservation grant.  The federation is happy with that and it is agreed.</p><p>We have also said that the grant aid that is available for the maintenance of wells will be maintained and enhanced, which has also been welcomed.  Therefore, it is not true to say we have not dealt with some of those issues.<br/><br/>When it is looking at these issues there is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas committee from addressing issues such as water poverty and the concerns over privatisation.</p></speech>

I am not making a judgment on what they should recommend.  We have broad terms of reference allowing them to consider all the issues on how Ireland pays for domestic water supply and wastewater treatment in the future.  Should it be through general taxation?  Should it be through a charging system that has full cost recovery?  Should it be a mixture of both?  If so, how do we create acceptance for that?  That is why we have the mix of skill sets, based on guidelines we got from another independent source as to the skill sets we would need on such a commission.</p></speech>

That gets to the heart of it.  The points about the European Commission are very important from the opposite point of view to the way the Labour Party sees them.  We can see that the European Commission will be used to try to limit the terms of the debate and to say at the end of it that we have no choice but to go along with it.  The point is very important.  No immediate fines are coming into play here in the very arguable case for a government to make in terms of no established practice.  There were three different answers from the Commission over three years, including the first one given to Deputy Kelly, who at the time was an MEP, which was very clear in pointing in the opposite direction.</p>  <p>  The Government should not collude in, participate in and drive the process of subversion.  Obviously, that is what is what is happening.  In particular, it should apply to activate Article 9.4, the effective derogation, the exemption, in its second cycle river-basin management plan proposal.  It is very important that the Government does that.  Even if it is not in favour of getting rid of water charges, it has established this process that is supposed to be open-ended; it should be allowed to decide.</p>  <p>  We will not press amendment No. 8 but there is no reason for the Government to oppose it.  By this evening, we will have passed this legislation and by definition it will come in afterwards.  We will press amendment No. 9 because it is a question of democracy and it is the only opportunity to raise that question of democratic process here given that everything else was ruled out.</p></speech>
