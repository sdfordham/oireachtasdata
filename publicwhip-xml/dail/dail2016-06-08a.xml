However, there are some measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.  Indeed, one of my highest priorities under the programme for Government is to develop an effective response to price volatility, including through initiatives with regard to access to finance and taxation.</p>  <p>  I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important insulation against volatility.  The Food Wise strategy for the sector contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.  I will chair the next meeting of the Food Wise high-level implementation group next week, focusing on the important topics of market development and access to finance.</p><p>Direct payments estimated by Teagasc at an average of more than &euro;17,000 per farm in 2015 provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.<br/><br/>With regard to farm borrowings, I will meet the CEOs of the main banks this month, all of whom, I know, are aware of price volatility issues.  I will be pressing them for details on how they are handling current difficulties and their plans for the medium to longer term when liquidity difficulties may become more evident.  Another important topic for discussion will be the cost of credit for lending to farmers.<br/><br/>My Department has also engaged actively with other financial institutions with regard to the development of innovative new lending products for the sector and is preparing to procure an <i>ex ante</i>evaluation for the introduction of financial instruments under the rural development programme.  The Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.<br/><br/>At EU level, I have met Commissioner Hogan on several occasions recently and have proposed a plan of action to him for an EU response to the current market difficulties, including increasing the percentage of the &euro;1.2 billion in Irish direct payments that can be paid in advance; the introduction of a targeted aid package similar to that provided last September; the removal of customs tariffs and anti-dumping duties on the importation of fertilisers, which issue comes within the remit of the trade Commissioner, Mr. Moscovici; a substantial increase in the volume limit for fixed price intervention for skimmed milk powder, which the Commission has now agreed; and the renewal of efforts to resolve the veterinary issues that have blocked exports to Russia.  I intend to remain in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on these proposals over the coming weeks.<br/><br/>I also plan to chair an early meeting of the dairy forum to progress a number of specific initiatives in that sector.</p></reply>

I also congratulate Deputy Andrew Doyle on his appointment as Minister of State at that Department.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is a crucial Department, dealing with a sector that is important to our economy and to many working families.  I wish the Minister and Minister of State well in their endeavours.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, I look forward to working closely with them to try to ensure agricultural incomes are protected and the sector thrives.</p>  <p>  The question deals with income volatility, decreasing prices and the expectation in too many farming sectors of producing at below the cost of production, which issues are the cause of growing concern for farmers.  The Teagasc annual farm survey, which is valuable in the significant contribution it makes every year to the debate on the state of the farming sector, showed an average increase in farm income last year of 6%, albeit from a very low base.  I know the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, are aware of the difficulties facing the dairy, beef and tillage sectors, among others.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's statement that he proposes to meet the CEOs of the financial institutions.  Will he comment on the proposed establishment of a national food ombudsman to ensure a mechanism is in place through which primary food producers can get a fair price for the food they produce?  Will the Minister also comment on convening a joint meeting of the existing beef and dairy forums and other sector representatives to discuss solutions to the current farm income crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800004#B00300"><p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for his kind remarks.  I look forward to working with him and his colleagues during my tenure as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Deputy referred to the recent Teagasc farm survey, which is a useful barometer but is somewhat behind the curve in so far as it deals with farm incomes for 2015.  We are all aware that incomes in 2016 will be substantially different.</p><p>It may not be widely understood outside the farming community that average farm incomes are still substantially below the average industrial wage.  That should be borne in mind in the context of the broader debate on the economy.  The Deputy said that the primary producer receives very little, and raised the prospect of a food ombudsman to address that issue.  In the dying months of the last Administration the Government introduced a series of initiatives through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which brought greater clarity to the treatment of food producers by the multiples with regard to the inclusion of everything in the contract.  We wait to see how effective that will be.  It will require ongoing vigilance.</p> <p> The Deputy may also be aware of an EU initiative under which Commissioner Phil Hogan expects a report before the end of the year on the supply chain and measures to improve the position of the primary producer.  While I am open-minded about a food ombudsman, it would be useful to have information that is current and up to date to feed into a process before we make any commitments on that.  I will be convening meetings this month of the dairy forum and, I hope, the beef forum to discuss the income crisis.</p></speech>

The average income is approximately &euro;16,000 per annum for sheep and &euro;13,000 per annum for beef, which means that many farm families are struggling to make a real income from farming.  A total of 40% of all farms in the country have an annual income of less than &euro;10,000.  Direct payments last year were down 10%.  That is a particular difficulty facing those farms because of the reduced CAP pot, which impinges significantly on them as well.</p>  <p>  Would the Minister meet the dairy forum and beef forum together and bring other actors and interests in the agricultural sector, such as those in industry and the financial sector, together at one meeting?  That would be very useful and would reflect the fact that the Government understands the crisis facing farming, if indeed it does.  It would also provide reassurance that it will look for solutions.</p></speech>

I have met with the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, ICMSA, and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association, ICSA, and I propose to meet soon with the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers' Association, INHFA.  I am acutely aware of the income crisis inside the farm gate and the fact that in many respects it is out of kilter with what is happening for those employed in the food industry generally, where returns are still quite handsome and profitable.  I do not propose to convene a joint meeting.  I do not see a useful purpose in meeting the dairy forum and the beef forum jointly, because the way they are constituted is to represent the issues in each of those sectors, which in many instances are separate and different issues.  I propose to have a meeting of those forums very early this month.</p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly identifies the sheep and beef sectors as being at the lower end of the farm survey by Teagasc.  The Government is rolling out and hopes to finalise a submission on a &euro;25 million sheep scheme to the European Commission.  I would welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s input and that of other interested parties in the ongoing consultation.</p></speech>

Officials from that Department have been in contact with the bank in question with regard to the details of the loan sale.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the sale of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p>  <p>  Active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is key to achieving a sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears who have not already done so to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or contacting the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.</p><p> In regard to the consequences for agriculture, my predecessor, Deputy Coveney, wrote to the bank in early April to express his concerns.  The bank replied that a low number of agricultural customers were potentially affected by the sale and that it has proactively engaged and worked with such customers.  It also stated that any potential sale of non-performing SME loans would only be done after the completion of an extensive review of each customer's individual circumstances.  The bank gave assurances that throughout this process it remains fully committed to supporting all of its customers, including those in the agriculture and food sectors.</p> <p> In addition to this correspondence, my officials have been in contact with the bank in question on a regular basis with regard to sale of these loans.  I will meet the CEO of the bank later this month and this issue will be one of the topics on the agenda.</p></reply>

This issue cuts across many of the things that affect people the length and breadth of rural Ireland.  Many people are in significant debt, aside from those in the agricultural sector.  A lot of this debt, which may put large amounts of farmland under the hammer and allow it to fall into the hands of vulture capitalists, was generated not on farms but elsewhere.  Unfortunately, in many cases farms were put up as collateral and are now falling foul of such agreements.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the Minister's proposal to meet the CEO of the bank concerned, I urge him, prior to the meeting, to write to the CEO and implore him not to proceed with any sale of land.  Many of the people affected are seriously concerned that this agricultural land, which is valued at up to &euro;100 million, will go out of the hands of people living in the State and be bought by vulture capitalists from other countries.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the Minister take a hands-on approach.  Agricultural land that belongs to the people of Ireland should remain in Ireland.  Everything should be done to ensure that the land is kept in the hands of the people who currently own it.  I call on the Minister to implore the bank to ensure that whatever can be done is done.</p></speech>

As I said in my response, I have arranged a meeting on 29 June with the new CEO of the bank in question, Mr. Mallon.  I will raise all of the issues that affect farmers, including credit and the sale of loans.  It is not a question of the bank selling land; rather, it is selling distressed loans.  I take the Deputy's point.  In many respects, these bad debts arise from off-farm investments rather than investments involving matters inside farm gates.  That is a specific issue which I will raise with the CEO.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my response, the previous Minister was in contact with the bank in April.  I have already been in contact with it and have arranged a meeting.  Officials in my Department are in continuous contact.  It is important to emphasise that the sale of loans does not have an adverse impact on the rights contained in the original contracts between borrowers and lenders.  A critical factor to note is that the same protections exist legally for borrowers in respect of the sale of loans to third parties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-08a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800006#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  I am glad to hear that, but many farmers are concerned that when loans are sold to entities outside the State they may not come under the same control and regulation as pertains to banks registered in the State.</p>  <p>  The Minister is quite correct that many loans were generated from off-farm activities.  I am aware of a farmer who had some money in his local bank during the boom, when everything was going well.  He was called in to meet the bank manager, who told the farmer that he should invest money in something.  He said that the bank had a particular set of investments available, and it would top up the farmer's savings by lending him money.  It was through the encouragement of the banks that people got into so much debt.  The bubble burst and the gravy train that banks set up for people at the end of their retirement or whatever all went wrong.  People were left with significant debts and they are now under a threat in that their loans may be sold to vulture funds.  Naturally, most people are very fearful that such funds would have no compassion for farmers living in rural Ireland and would sell their property.  Many such difficulties have arisen in a particular set of circumstances, in many cases where banks were the key players in creating the debt in the first place.</p></speech>

Perhaps it would be good advice in respect of the parties involved.  However, I take the point the Deputy raised.  I do not think there is much difference between the approaches we take to the matter.  My approach will be to assist, in so far as we practically can, farmers who are in that situation.  We will impress on the financial institutions a requirement for forbearance.  We do not know whomever the purchaser of the loans will be, whether it is a fund outside of the State or within it.  The loan book has not yet been disposed of, but in the context of the overall loan sale there is a small proportion of vulture funds, and I accept that is a worrying development for any individual farmer who is in that situation.  For that reason I wish to reassure those individual farmers that their legal entitlement in respect of the sale of those loans to a third party is not impacted in any adverse way and remains unchanged.  As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I will work to try to ensure there is a satisfactory outcome through the forbearance we can extract from the bank involved.</p></speech>

According to CSO figures, in 2015 we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products and imports from the UK were worth &euro;3.8 billion.  The prospect of a UK vote to leave the EU therefore has serious implications for the agrifood sector.  That is borne out in the reports that have been produced in recent months on the potential impact of Brexit on Ireland.  An ESRI report last year estimated that the potential reduction in bilateral trade flows could be as high as 20%, with an even higher impact on agriculture, food and beverages.  Teagasc, at the request of my Department, carried out a deeper analysis on the Irish agrifood sector.  It found that, depending on the assumptions made, the minimum impact could be a reduction of 1.4% or &euro;150 million per annum in the value of Irish agrifood exports, with a possible worst-case scenario involving a reduction of more than 7%, or &euro;800 million, per annum.  However, it is important to note that there would be no dramatic change straight away and that the actual impact of Brexit would depend on the post-exit relationship that will have to be negotiated between the EU and the UK, should the UK decide to leave.  The Treaty on European Union provides for a period of two years of negotiations, with extensions possible where agreement is not reached in the initial period.</p>  <p>  My Department has been considering the likely arrangements to be made in the event of an exit vote.  There are four main areas from an agrifood perspective, namely, tariffs and trade arrangements, the EU budget, standards and customs controls.  Potential differences in tariffs after a UK exit could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials.  Once the exit negotiations have been completed, the UK would be free to negotiate free trade agreements with other third countries.  That is particularly relevant in relation to meat imports from South America.</p>  <p>  The UK is a net contributor to the budget and a UK exit could result in a loss of the UK contribution of between 5% and 10%.  Given that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead.  Currently, the EU operates a common regulatory regime and the rules of the Single Market allow free movement of goods between member states.  While the EU and the UK may wish to keep such arrangements in place for as long as possible, deviations between UK and EU standards could give rise to trading difficulties and additional costs.</p></reply>

Both Ministers have served long apprenticeships and I have worked with them on the agriculture committees in recent years.  As Labour Party spokesperson on rural affairs and agriculture, I look forward to working constructively with them.</p>  <p>  Is it not clear that the impact of Brexit will be significant?  As the Minister said, the ESRI report referred to a reduction in trade of 20%.  Greenland is the only country to leave the Union under an Article 50 procedure and it took more than three years.  I have no doubt discussions following Brexit would take us into 2020.  The negotiations would take longer than two years so we would have such a period of negotiation.  Is it not the case that following Brexit, if the UK were outside the EU, tariffs could be imposed on Irish imports which would lead Irish food producers to seek out other markets for exports?  That would likely result in reduced prices, which in turn would lead to downward pressure on prices paid to farmers for beef.  That would be very significant.  A total of 50% of beef exports currently go to Britain, worth &euro;1.1 billion.  Dairy exports, which are almost one third of our exports are worth almost &euro;1 billion.</p><p>Moreover, as Deputy O'Keeffe will be aware, 60%, or &euro;330 million worth, of Ireland's pig production goes to the United Kingdom, so that would have a huge impact.  Is it not the position that there is no current provision for negotiating a special deal between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the event of a Brexit?  Would this be important?  As the Minister noted, the potential for the United Kingdom to negotiate external trade agreements with third countries would be a huge risk for Ireland.  Would this not lead to displacement of Irish products on the UK market and have a significant negative impact on the Irish food industry?</p></speech>

Agriculture always has been close to his heart, and I look forward to working with him.</p>  <p>  Brexit is an issue of enormous concern for the agriculture sector in particular and is exercising the minds of the whole of Government.  While people ask themselves what they can do without being seen to meddle, there are 140,000 people in the State who are entitled to vote in that referendum, and many of us know people in those communities and should reach out to them.  When the Mercosur trade agreement did not have an initial offer on beef, people breathed a sigh of relief.  However, that achievement would pale into insignificance were the UK to leave the EU and be in a position to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with South America.  This is possibly one of the first things the United Kingdom would attempt to do, and the Deputy rightly points out that slightly less than 50% of Ireland's beef exports are on supermarket shelves in the United Kingdom.  This encapsulates the scale of the potential crisis we face.</p>  <p>  As I stated, this issue is exercising the whole of Government.  My Department is feeding into a group within the Department of the Taoiseach that is assessing risks and strategies to deal with this issue.  As Deputy McConalogue would be aware, a lot of milk is gathered in Northern Ireland to be brought south of the Border for processing.  Given that this milk would now be crossing the border between the UK and the European Union, were Brexit to take place, issues would arise regarding border controls and so on.  The Deputy raises an issue of enormous economic concern, a matter of which the Department is acutely aware.</p></speech>

The cost of energy would loom large in the event of Brexit because Ireland imports 89% of its oil and 93% of its gas requirements from the United Kingdom, and in Ireland the agriculture sector spends approximately &euro;500 million per year on energy.  Would this not inevitably lead to increased production costs, which in turn would reduce our competitiveness?  This would be a huge issue.</p>  <p>  In the event of Brexit, Ireland would also lose an important ally in the European context for arguing its case.  The Minister is correct in stating that 37% of the budget is devoted to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  As Britain is a net contributor, this is likely to have a significant negative impact on future spending on the CAP, particularly from 2021 onwards.  This will be the kernel of the issue that people may not realise.</p></speech>

There are existing cross-Border interconnectors and so on, and all of these arrangements would come under the microscope in the new dispensation that would apply.  I refer to the uncertainty that would follow in the context of two years of negotiations, which would halt investment and damage confidence and would lead to fluctuations and currency movements that would create greater disadvantages for products from Ireland.  I will take up with my Cabinet colleagues the issue of energy supply in particular.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of animal and plant health regulations and standards.  It would obviously be open to the United Kingdom to change the standards.</p></speech>

The Government has engaged in intensive discussions with the European Commission for some time now to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and climate change.</p><p> As part of our ongoing engagement at EU level, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughten, and I met recently with Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca&ntilde;ete, the European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, to discuss proposals on the EU&rsquo;s effort sharing decision and on land use, land-use change, and forestry, LULUCF.</p> <p> The meeting provided me with an opportunity to restate the commitment of the Irish agriculture sector to improving efficiency and driving down emissions, and to re-emphasise the importance of reflecting the 2014 European Council conclusions in the proposed effort-sharing decision, particularly in terms of their recognition of the low mitigation potential of the sector and their reference to the inclusion of afforestation and LULUCF as part of future climate and energy policy.</p> <p> Afforestation, the creation of new forests, is included as a specific mitigation measure in paragraph 2.14 of the Council conclusions.  This is important for Ireland as afforestation is the main cost-effective land-based climate mitigation tool available to us.Â  Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid-century.</p> <p> Annual estimates of the current level of uptake of carbon dioxide by forests are provided by my Department to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Projected levels of uptake in forests and storage in solid wood products out to 2020 have been provided to the European Commission under Decision 529/2013 on land use, land-use change and forestry.</p> <p> We will continue to work closely with the Commission prior to the launch of proposals for an effort-sharing decision, which are expected later this summer.  It should also be noted that Ireland is one of a small number of EU countries to have elected to report on cropland and grazing land management activities under the Kyoto Protocol.  This would allow Ireland to take advantage of any sequestration benefits that may be allowed in the future from these activities.</p></reply>

The EU's discussions on how we will meet our emissions targets for 2030 represent a big challenge for Irish agriculture.  This represents a key issue for the Minister's Department in the coming years and for the Irish team negotiating with their European counterparts.</p>  <p>  Outside New Zealand, Ireland has the largest proportion of emissions in the world coming from agriculture.  One third of all Irish emissions are from agriculture, whereas the average figure across Europe is 10%.  Any issues, therefore, concerning emissions targets for agriculture which are debated at European level are much more challenging for us than for anywhere else.  </p>  <p>  It is crucial for the Minister to note, and our negotiators must be strong on this point, that the production of agricultural produce in Ireland is much more energy and carbon efficient than elsewhere.  On average, it is about one third less.  A key point in these negotiations is to ensure that when it comes to setting technical targets for methane and ammonia, a false economy is not brought into play by setting high targets.  That would mean that other countries would end up producing more agriculture which is less carbon efficient, while the pressure is on Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to comment further on what he expects and how confident he is that agriculture will be protected in these negotiations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-08a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800009#G00300"><p>I confess that I did not quite grasp the level of achievement by the Irish agriculture sector until I was appointed as Minister.  It is not widely understood that we are the most carbon-efficient producer of milk, bar none.  In addition, through the beef data and genomics programme we are targeting the beef sector to lighten its carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  Deputy McConalogue said that agriculture accounts for 30% of our carbon emissions, while the figure is 10% across the rest of the EU.  That is factually correct but in a sense he is comparing apples with oranges, as I am sure he will appreciate.  This is the message we must sell to the European Commission.  We never had the industrial revolution here, so we do not have a history of heavy industry.  However, we do have the most carbon-efficient industrial sector inside the farm gate.  We are involved in measuring the carbon footprint of every individual farmer in the country.  We have to sell that message and get it across forcibly.</p>  <p>  I salute what has been achieved to date by the farming community.  We are not seeking special exemptions because most of the required efforts are cost-reduction measures.  The key is the Council conclusions which said that there is a limit to what agriculture can achieve in terms of reducing the burden of its carbon footprint.</p><p>However, we also must have sustainable food production practices.  Given the growing population, there will be 9 billion people to feed by 2050.  Is it not far better to have food produced in an intensive way here, with a low carbon footprint, rather than having carbon leakage from across the seas with beef coming in from South America, for example?  These are the salient matters we must convey in that debate.</p></speech>

Accordingly, I do not propose to revoke the statutory instrument until a revised system can be put in place.  The Deputy will be aware that the European Commission is empowered to commence infringement proceedings against member states that are not implementing EU law.  A negative judgment from the European Court of Justice in this context could cost the State significantly in lump sum and ongoing fines.  There would also be serious potential implications with regard to the release of funding for the fishing industry under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.</p></reply>

We could have secured a majority in this House to revoke it because a majority oppose it.  If it was not legal then, it is not legal now.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify and deal with this as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  For the information of those Members who do not understand, penalty points for any infringements are put on one's licence and the highest court in the land cannot change that.  I am pleased the Minister is changing it, but I still believe he should consider revoking it and put in place the template that is acceptable to the European Union, which is the one in the UK.  Finally, although it might be too early to respond to this, does the Minister expect to do this by way of primary legislation or another statutory instrument?  To be fair, the Minister acted very quickly and we are pleased with that.  However, we are a little concerned that he has not revoked it.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it is a matter of concern for Deputies representing all coastal areas from Malin Head to Mizen Head and, indeed, on the eastern seaboard.  I could not revoke the existing statutory instrument without being in a position to replace it immediately with something else because that would have attracted the attention of the European Commission to the fact that we did not have an effective dissuasive legal instrument in place.  I am committed to acting to address that anomaly at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  In my initial response I referred to legal and administrative issues.

The funding is &euro;240 million, some of which has already been committed in projects in the Deputy's constituency and elsewhere.

The only part of that process that is within my jurisdiction in the Department is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  I will ensure that it is in a position to fulfil its part of that process as efficiently and effectively as possible.

Accordingly, free trade and free trade agreements are very important to us.  Historically, the negotiation of access to new markets has been a big driver of economic development in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is commonly recognised that 90% of the growth in the world economy will be outside Europe in the years ahead.  I believe we have to negotiate better access and become more committed to those markets where growth will occur in the future.  Indeed, Food Wise 2025 highlights the need to expand current markets and develop new ones if we are to achieve the potential growth that the strategy foresees over the next ten years.</p>  <p>  This is true also of the potential of the EU-US trade corridor.  About one third of all world trade occurs on that corridor so it has significant potential importance for Europe and for Ireland.  The US is one of our leading trading partners and we have a large and growing agrifood trade surplus with it with exports of &euro;869 million last year compared to imports of &euro;271 million.</p>  <p>  Ireland has significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations.  For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products and further opportunities for branded packaged butter if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.</p>  <p>  In respect of Brexit, it is clear that there are considerable potential negative implications for the Irish agrifood sector, as evidenced by the reports that have been conducted by the ESRI, Teagasc and others.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner and there is a general consensus across all the analyses that a UK exit would have the greatest impact on the agrifood sector.  However, much of these analyses have been based on a "worst case" scenario and it is very difficult to estimate the actual impact an exit will have on the agrifood sector prior to any post-exit negotiations that must take place between the EU and the UK should the UK decide to leave.</p>  <p>  While it may be difficult to predict with certainty what the impact on the agrifood sector would be, impacts are foreseen in a number of areas such as tariff and trade arrangements, the EU budget, standards and customs controls.  Potential differences in tariffs could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials.</p><p>As a net contributor to the EU budget, a UK exit will result in a loss of the UK contribution to that budget of between 5% and 10%, with consequential implications for CAP spending in the years ahead.</p></reply>

There are broader issues, which the Minister has outlined.  There would be challenges to Ireland as the food nation and food island, with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, and I ask the Minister to use his good offices to address those challenges.  There are approximately 900,000 citizens with a vote in the UK who have Irish connections and while it is a choice for them, as the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, has outlined, we should use our good offices here to portray to them that it would have a negative impact on our country.  We should also examine any potential positives of a Brexit and how they would feed through.</p>  <p>  In terms of TTIP, low commodity prices, which are a very significant concern for the primary producer at present, are an issue and access to the markets is absolutely crucial.  As part of TTIP we should make sure we do not trade beef off against other commodities but anything that opens up new markets is a positive.</p></speech>

We need to export 90% of what we produce on the island.  We can feed 50 million people with the exports we produce here to a high quality and standard.  Trade is our lifeblood but it is trade on our terms in a way that protects our primary producers.  The more markets we have, the better prices we can extract.  I acknowledge that a Brexit would be particularly devastating for the agrifood sector.  In consultations with the stakeholders I have met since my appointment I have emphasised that they have a skin in the game in this debate and in whatever way they consider appropriate they should reach out to people they can influence, whether it is the 140,000 people living here, the very significant Irish expat population in the UK or many of the major agrifood players who have operations in the UK.  They should try to influence that debate in whatever way they can.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Heydon on TTIP.  We have both offensive and defensive interest in this regard and we need to make sure that any negotiation is concluded in terms that are beneficial to us.  We never get everything we want in negotiations but we should not compromise on the standards of food production or on the safety of the food we produce in any way.  They are cornerstones of negotiations that will not be compromised.</p></speech>

I attach major importance to the live cattle export trade, and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been proactive in encouraging and facilitating such exports.</p>  <p>  Last year saw high levels of exports of cattle to both Britain and Northern Ireland, largely driven by favourable currency rates, which made cattle from this country very competitive in those markets.  However, as a result of a closer euro versus sterling exchange rate, exports to the UK this year are lower by approximately 50%.  Exports to Italy, however, are up by almost 20% and exports to Spain have grown by 11%. </p>  <p>  The markets currently open to live cattle from Ireland include Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Serbia and Algeria, in addition to other member states of the European Union.  Animal health restrictions and geopolitical instability have impeded previously large-scale exports to Belgium and north Africa respectively.</p>  <p>  In this regard my Department has agreed health certificates for the export of live cattle to Egypt, Serbia and Algeria in 2016 and is currently investigating the possibility of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro, and Turkey as well as breeding cattle to Morocco.  My Department recently hosted a veterinary inspection by the Turkish authorities and is awaiting a report from that exercise.</p><p> The exploitation of market outlets, once opened, is a commercial matter for the live export sector and is affected by the usual variables, including the cost of animals at marts, domestic demand for live cattle, the relative cost of beef on the domestic and international markets, currency exchange rates, transport costs and other factors.</p> <p> There is a strong demand for meat globally and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access and enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.</p> <p> Last year was a very successful year for meat exports and, according to Bord Bia, overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to &euro;3.5 billion.  Although exports to the European Union account for the majority of meat exports, increasingly, third country markets are an important alternative outlet for the industry.</p> <p> I will continue to ensure that Irish meat and livestock producers have the option of exporting to as many global markets as possible.</p></reply>

He outlined the importance of the live sector trade to the agriculture industry and ensuring there are alternatives available for producers.  It is concerning to many of those to see that the numbers of live exports declined sharply in 2016.  The reports indicate that live trade numbers are down by over 20% in 2016, and that decline has accelerated in quarter 2, with a decrease of more than 30%.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Department indicated that exports to the United Kingdom this year are lower by approximately 50%, although I know sterling has an impact in that regard.</p>  <p>  Many of those involved in the export of animals to Turkey have purchased thousands of live stores in the expectation that the Turkish market would be open.  However, they are now particularly worried that additional delays in market access will result in the weanlings missing the specifications required for this overseas market.  The Minister indicated that is something that is on his table.  Will he give an outline as to how quickly he expects that market will be reopened to ensure there is not any unnecessary delays regarding the export trade to Turkey?</p></speech>

The Turkish veterinary delegation were here inspecting a number of our plants, processes and so on.  A substantial number of plants have expressed an interest in this trade.  We must wait until such time as the members of the Turkish delegation come back to us with their proposals and we then finalise the administrative arrangements.  We must await the response of the delegation who visited here.  There is no delay on the Irish side, and I assure the Deputy that once we get feedback from the Turkish delegation, we will move as quickly as is humanly possible to deal with the matter.  I acknowledge that live exports are down in some markets this year but that is a factor I reference in my reply in the context of there being many variables.  What the State can do is open markets, and the State has opened a substantial number of new markets, but it is up to the industry to respond in terms of availing of those opportunities contingent on the prices that are available for cattle in the factories here, currency fluctuations and a range of variables that impact on whether it is profitable for those exporters to avail of those markets.</p>  <p>  With regard to the point the Deputy made about people purchasing cattle at this stage for Turkish specifications that we have not yet had sight of, that would appear to be premature, but we await feedback from the Turkish and will not be found wanting in terms of the speed of our response.</p></speech>

I am sure his Department officials are in ongoing contact with them.

I will revert to the Deputy with the details for the other areas.  I cannot say definitively when the Turkish authorities will come back to us.  It is approximately two weeks since they left here and I understand from the officials in my Department that they were quite impressed by what they saw in terms of the specification of animals that would suit their market demands, but we await their response and we will not be found wanting on our side in terms of opening up that market for live exports.  There is significant opportunity there because of an outbreak of bluetongue in France, where they traditionally source cattle.</p><p>We are hoping to be able to capitalise on that opportunity but it is contingent on the Turkish veterinary authorities responding favourably to what they saw here and doing so in a timely manner that will help the industry.  Once we complete all the necessary paperwork, the industry must step in and determine whether this is a viable market in which to operate.</p></speech>

These schemes were launched under the new rural development programme for 2014 to 2020 and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  The financial allocation to each scheme for the full rural development programme period is as follows: the young farmer capital investment scheme has &euro;120 million; the dairy equipment scheme has &euro;50 million; the organic capital investment scheme has &euro;8 million; the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme has &euro;170 million; low-emission slurry spreading has &euro;4 million; and the pig and poultry investment scheme has &euro;17 million.</p>  <p>  The schemes are open for applications in rolling three-month tranches.  Approvals and part-approvals have issued in respect of 1,300 cases.  Approvals are now issuing on an ongoing basis.  The numbers of applications received in the first two tranches are as follows: the young farmer capital investment scheme saw 513 applications for tranche 1 and 620 applications for tranche 2; the dairy equipment scheme saw 1,088 applications for tranche 1 and 595 applications for tranche 2; the pig and poultry investment scheme saw 57 applications for tranche 1 and 38 applications for tranche 2; the scheme for low-emission slurry spreading saw 194 applications for tranche 1 and 263 applications for tranche 2; the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme saw 939 applications for tranche 1 and 607 applications for tranche 2; and the organic capital investment scheme saw 192 applications for tranche 1 and 99 applications for tranche 2.  The total for tranche 1 is 2,983 and the total for tranche 2 is 2,222.  When the number of applications received in tranche 3 to date are included, the total number of applications to date is 5,342.  The TAMS information technology payment claim system is being finalised and payments will be made once the system is in place.  I hope that will be ready to run in late July.</p></reply>

Many farmers were planning on investing this summer and getting works under way.  They have been hampered by the fact that approvals have not been forthcoming and they are currently waiting for the Department to get back to them.  The process has been much too slow and it has put the farming sector and those who are keen to invest in a position that leads to exceptional frustration.  It is also putting additional pressure on farmers in trying to get works completed in a timely fashion.  The work is backing up when it could be done in a more orderly way in line with the applications coming into the Department.  The figure stands at 1,300 now, but when does the Minister expect the farmers who have applied to at least get initial approval so they can commence a process of investment?</p></speech>

It was the legitimate ambition of the Department to try to roll out as many schemes as possible at the earliest possible dates, which put significant stress on the administrative capacity of the Department.  For example, it would have been easier to defer a number of these initiatives to 2017 and handle the process in a more measured way.  Ambition is not a fault, and we are effectively now catching up with the backlog.  There are 1,300 approvals from a total of 5,342 applications, but the applications in tranche 3 were only recently submitted.  We are rolling out approvals all the time and the first payments will go out late in July.  I acknowledge that in an ideal world we would have had the systems in place to deal with all the schemes from day one, but there was much pressure from individual farmers who wanted to carry out investment in early spring on dairy schemes, milking parlours and so on.</p><p>In so far as it was possible, the Department tried to accommodate all of them.  It would have been easier and maybe in hindsight it was the right thing to do.  I am not sure.  I think it was right to have the ambition to try to bring the scheme to as many farmers as possible.  We are playing catch-up but we are getting there.</p></speech>

That led to a very pressurised environment for farmers with regard to being able to get contractors and others who were required where building work was necessary.  We are obviously at a different stage in terms of TAMS in that we are at the beginning of the scheme.  Having said that, there are many farmers who had expected to have initial approval at this stage.  It was a fair assumption for many of them to make.  I acknowledge that the Minister is saying the Department has been slower than he had hoped in being able to give those approvals.  What assurance can he give those who are waiting on approval at this stage that they will get it promptly?  For example, where does he expect to be come July or August in respect of approvals and what assurances can he give those awaiting approval?</p></speech>

If there are individual cases, I am sure the Deputy would find a willing ear in the Department to deal with them.  We are working through this sequentially and we are catching up with the backlog.</p>  <p>  I suspect we will not have the type of problem Deputy McConalogue alluded to because anecdotally I am hearing that a number of people who have approval under TAMS are postponing investments for which they have approval because of the difficulty in the commodity markets, particularly in the dairy sector.  Therefore, I do not expect that problem of many approved farmers chasing a limited number of contractors to occur in the short term.  I do not anticipate it but it is an area that will require constant vigilance and I assure the Deputy that will be forthcoming from me and from my Department.</p></speech>

I have received this advice and have considered the issues arising.  I am satisfied that I am in a position to move on the introduction of a system for the sequential application of EU penalty points in conjunction with the prosecution process, thus fulfilling the ambition outlined in the partnership programme.  I also met representatives of the fishing industry last week to discuss a wide range of issues, including their concerns about the implementation of the EU points system, and have updated them on this matter.</p><p>This new arrangement is subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues to ensure compliance with EU law.  I intend to report back to the Oireachtas as soon as I have finalised a way forward in the context of dealing with the relevant legal and administrative matters.  I am confident, however, that these matters can be dealt with in a collaborative and constructive manner with all stakeholders.</p><p>In the meantime, it is important that the 2016 SI remain in force in order that Ireland remains in compliance with the legal requirement to implement the EU points system.  Accordingly, I do not propose to revoke the SI until a revised system can be put in place.  The Deputy will be aware that the European Commission is empowered to commence infringement proceedings against member states that are not implementing EU law.  A negative judgment from the European Court of Justice in this context could cost the State significantly in lump sum and ongoing fines.  There would also be serious potential implications with regard to the release of funding for the fishing industry under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.</p></reply>

Deputy Ferris might be able to confirm that.  I am unsure if there would be any prosecutions taken under it.  There are some administrative sides to that statutory instrument which have not been put in place by my Department.  I am moving to a new system and I intend to replace that statutory instrument.  The legal and administrative issues I have raised in my reply relate to whether the new system will be an amendment to that statutory instrument, if it will be a new statutory instrument or if we will proceed by way of primary legislation.  All of this is predicated on meeting the EU administrative requirement that the system must be seen as an effective and dissuasive instrument to the fishing community.  I have some hurdles to jump yet, but the principle of penalty points only being applied consequent upon a conviction is conceded and is something we are committed to delivering.  However, I cannot say whether there have been any convictions or points applied.  I suspect not since the introduction of this statutory instrument, which was only signed in March 2016.</p></speech>

The welfare of greyhounds involved in coursing is provided for in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 which<i>, inter alia,</i>requires that persons who course greyhounds must have regard to the code of practice in the care and welfare of the greyhound, developed jointly by the ICC and Bord na gCon.  The ICC has assured my Department that it has extensive systems and  practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of welfare are adhered to.</p><p>A monitoring committee on coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to monitor developments in coursing and the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner.</p><p>Hares may only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC in accordance with the terms of licences granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  These licences contain 26 conditions which have been refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare and include a variety of measures, such as a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends at all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours.</p><p>Coursing clubs are required to comply fully with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds.  I have no plans to ban hare coursing but I have no hesitation in saying that it is critically important that those involved in the sport must operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and with the welfare of both hares and greyhounds in mind at all times.</p></reply>

We have an incredible contradiction where, on the one hand, hares are protected under the Wildlife Act but, on the other, under the Animal Health and Welfare Act all animals are protected with the exception of hares to be coursed.  This resulted, in 2015, in a situation where 7,000 hares were taken from the wild to be used in live coursing events.  We are one of a minority of countries which allow this barbarity to continue.  Contrary to the Minister's statements on the conditions hares face, the reports from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is employed to monitor this situation, tell us that only 17 of the 75 events held in the country last year had National Parks and Wildlife Service officials in attendance and the state of many of the hares requiring assistance, which were released back to the wild distressed, is evident in its reports, which refute the information given to the Minister by Bord na gCon.</p></speech>

I am not sure if Deputy Daly is suggesting that we should have an imported solution to an Irish problem.  I highlight that a very high proportion of hares netted for hare coursing were returned successfully to the wild.  For example, at the end of the 2014-15 season, 99.3% of hares captured were released in a healthy condition back after coursing.  We have moved some distance in respect of where coursing was some years ago in terms of the monitoring and high standards of welfare we apply in terms of both the greyhound and the hare, something to which all parties involved can be paid tribute, including Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and my Department.  For that reason, we have now reached a situation where we have a sustainable industry and I do not propose to ban the industry.</p></speech>

I speak as a Deputy who represents the only part of Dublin where this practice still continues.  The Irish Council Against Blood Sports has a video of this barbarity in Balbriggan, which is in my constituency.  It shows agitated hares running up and down within the confines of a coursing field while coursing members shout and scream at them in that enclosure.  With regard to the number of hares released back to the wild, many of those hares are in a very distressed state and die afterwards.  This has also been stated by officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In Nenagh, for example, some of those released included heavily pregnant hares, which the Minister has told us are supposed to be protected.  The rules do not serve to protect the hares in that regard, and how could they when we have greyhounds weighing 60 to 88 lbs and travelling at 43 mph, which can do a hell of a lot of harm, even if they wear a muzzle, to a hare that weighs approximately 6 lbs.  The protections are really not worth what is claimed, and this is one of the reasons the Irish hare - a unique race of mountain hare - is now becoming extinct, even though on one hand we say it should be protected.</p></speech>

Once these animal certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally.  Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport.Â </p>  <p>  I am aware that a very small number of greyhounds have been exported to Macau in the past two months.  I understand that Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic as well as the well-being of greyhounds, has developed a code of practice on the welfare of greyhounds.  This sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice. </p>  <p>  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of the International Greyhound Forum and mechanisms relating to intelligence and information which is received from welfare officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under that Act, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have recently met with representatives of Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum - represented by the ISPCA and Dogs Trust here in Ireland - to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  Bord na gCon advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to export only to destinations with high animal welfare standards and that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined under the code internationally, and I endorse this view.  I point out, however, that international trade takes place in a legally complex environment and that national legislation is not legally binding on activities in other states.</p></speech>

The Minister of State's response today is contradictory, as were the responses of his predecessors.  On the one hand, as the Minister of State has tried to do today, we have been told previously that once the appropriate animal health and welfare certificate requirements are met in transit it does not really matter what happens to them at the end of their journey.  However, contradicting that is the fact that in March of this year the Department blocked the Irish Greyhound Board from exporting dogs to China because of animal welfare concerns.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the practice, which poses significant danger to the dogs involved, is continuing.  The practice has been highlighted internationally by animal welfare organisations and has got quite a lot of global attention.  Deputy O'Sullivan's question is seeking the intervention of the Minister of State in this situation and for him to play a role.  To be honest, he can, because his predecessor has done it before, and the circumstances mean he should do it in this case, particularly to be in line with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  This Act states that anyone who trades, transports, rears or trains a greyhound has to have due regard to a code of practice.  It includes situations where they are being traded and transported, so the final destination is key.  If they are going to end up at a destination where they are going to be discarded, mauled and end up undoubtedly dead, we should stop that practice.</p></speech>

I pointed out that the figures were grossly inaccurate.  The CEO of the HSE said that the health service was under a death sentence and that the level of money provided in the budget was wholly inadequate and had left a significant shortfall.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, had indicated that there was a sufficiency of funding available to the health service.</p>  <p>  If one goes back over the past three to four years, every year at budget time we essentially got false figures on health.</p><p>They could never have stood up and subsequently did not, including the infamous &euro;680 million supplementary provision for 2014.  We now know because it was stated by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, that he knew the game was up when he lost the battle on that particular budget.  Last year, a &euro;600 million supplementary provision was provided.</p> <p> The head of the HSE said that the current budget would only meet existing levels of service, that is, the level of service provided in 2015.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the &euro;500 million allocation announced today will result in additional home care packages and mental health services and address acute hospital waiting lists and the shortage of funding in acute tertiary hospitals?  The Taoiseach will be aware that the figures for May show that there are 509,000 people on the outpatient waiting list and that there are approximately 75,000 people waiting for surgery, which is a 50% increase on the 50,000 figure for 2014.  These are extraordinary figures by any yardstick.  They illustrate a failure over recent years to provide any meaningful health service provision.  Will the extra &euro;500 million provide additional services or is it a sticking plaster to enable delivery of current levels of service across the board?</p></speech>

While we must work together in the interests of the country, Deputy Martin knows well the difficulties often encountered in health and that, as history has shown, throwing money at a problem is not the answer.  The Government is being criticised for making an adjustment to the health budget of more than &euro;400 million and a further adjustment to the justice budget.  We are in a position to do this because of the strengthening of the economy and growth in the economy.  One of the lessons we have learned in the recent past is that, where possible, we should spend money from that growth on areas of social need and, in this case, health need.  The extra allocation in terms of the adjusted Estimates, in respect of health in particular, is to deal with inadequacies, over-expenditure and much-needed investment in particular sectors.  The Minister's top priority is immediate address of some of these problems within 100 days.  Today's announcement confirms provision of additional funding for a winter initiative, about which the Minister has spoken, to help address overcrowding in emergency departments, which is always a cause of stress for people.  As an integral part of that particular initiative the Minister will increase resources for home care services, including home help packages and so on.</p>  <p>  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will utilise the Revised Estimate to restore the full ring-fenced mental health budget and provide more training to school-leavers with disabilities, which are two important and sensitive areas raised occasionally by many people.  Both Ministers will outline the detail of how that extra allocation will be spent to ensure delivery of services for people in those areas.  Also, the Government made clear this morning that this is not a case of throwing money at the problem as demand and expenditure continues to rise and expecting to continue as before.  The Government expects senior HSE personnel to be personally responsible for the management of their budgets and to ensure additional resources provided because of the strengthening economy are used to best effect in the interests of the patient they are supposed to serve.  We have demanded a different range of governance and better accountability from the HSE and so health service management will be responsible for performance of their budgets, including any additional resources.  It is in the acute hospitals that the Government sees the real possibility of greater returns.  It is hoped that these additional allocations will benefit the people they are intended to benefit, namely, patients.</p></speech>

This was pointed out before the election, including by the HSE chief executive officer when he said very explicitly that there was an under-provision for the health service, which has been under a death sentence for a number of years in terms of a lack of planning or vision.  They are the words of the CEO of the HSE, not mine, as stated in the context of the health service plan.</p>  <p>  The winter initiative is a hardy annual which had been announced already.  I am still not clear on whether the &euro;500 million will cover the overruns about which we learned when we met the health officials during talks prior to the formation of Government.  These officials were estimating dramatic increases in the first two months of the year above allocated levels and projecting a significant deficit by the end of the year.  This all points to a fundamental lack of transparency around health budgeting.  The last three budgets have not provided the D&aacute;il with an honest portrayal of health service requirements and needs.</p></speech>

The programme for Government commits to the establishment of a performance management unit which will require managers of individual hospitals to work with the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health to achieve an effective return on the moneys they receive.  The extra allocation of more than &euro;400 million is for the maintenance of existing services, to address overruns that have occurred, particularly in acute hospitals, to deal with what the Deputy called a hardy annual, namely, the winter initiative, which is an important element of health care, and to provide for school-leavers with disabilities, home care packages and full restoration of the intended allocation for mental health services, which money was not allocated in the manner it should have been.</p>  <p>  I expect that following organisation next week by the Whips of D&aacute;il business, there will be ample opportunity for Members of this House to tease out the details of these issues in plenary session and in committee.  As I indicated, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will spell out the details of what is involved in terms of additional services for mental health and in respect of school-leavers with disabilities who need these extra funds.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach avoided my question, I propose to put it to him again.  Some of the allegations are shocking.  Between May 2010 and November 2013, a member of NAMA's advisory board is alleged to have been charging a fee for advice about NAMA.  It is further alleged that the same individual had an unethical working relationship with a senior NAMA officer who gave him access to additional and sensitive commercial information.  It is also alleged that he was lobbying on behalf of clients to reduce loan repayment demands and in return he would secure cash payments, so-called fixer fees which were shared with the senior NAMA officer.  When NAMA decided to sell its Northern loan book to the US vulture fund Cerberus, this individual was offering to disclose information relating to the value of the loans to a bidder called PIMCO.</p><p>It is alleged that PIMCO discovered that payment of a fixer fee of &pound;15 million was requested, to be paid if PIMCO was successful.  PIMCO reported this to NAMA and withdrew from the process.  According to the response to a Sinn F&eacute;in freedom of information request, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was updated by the NAMA chairman regarding these transactions.  It is still unclear why the Minister did not intervene to exercise his general powers of direction over NAMA to suspend the sale&rsquo;s process until these matters were fully investigated.  If found to be accurate, these are serious allegations of financial corruption and insider trading from which the taxpayer has suffered a huge loss.  Since 2005, this State has had a market abuse regime and regulations which provide for the prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation.  These are criminal offences.  Will the Taoiseach explain why he will not establish a full investigation into these matters?  He has refused to do so thus far.  I and others have been asking for a very long time that he would at least do us the courtesy of explaining to us why he will not set up such an investigation.</p></speech>

If the Deputy has other information beyond that, he knows to bring it to the fraud squad and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He should produce evidence to me here in the House as to why a commission of investigation should take place in this jurisdiction when there are legal cases being pursued in Northern Ireland where a commission of investigation set up here would not have jurisdiction.

That is a distraction.  These are allegations and I have been very careful to couch them in that way.  The Taoiseach speaks of rumours.  I have not put any rumours to him.  It is very precise.  A member of NAMA&rsquo;s advisory board is alleged to have been guilty of malpractice and possible criminal offences, aided and abetted by a senior officer with NAMA.  Why will the Taoiseach not set up such an investigation when called upon to do so?  NAMA is an arm of the State.  It is not the Taoiseach&rsquo;s money and it is not my money; it is the people&rsquo;s money.  NAMA should be accountable and the Government should be transparent, open and accountable as well.</p>  <p>  We have never been given an explanation for the failure by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to intervene to suspend the sales process when he was informed that a fixer&rsquo;s fee of &pound;15 million was requested.  That is very straight and direct.  I am giving the Taoiseach the substance of these allegations.  We are concerned that taxpayers are not getting full value.  This includes the tens of thousands of families struggling to pay mortgages.  The money the Government is not putting into health services could have gone into these other people&rsquo;s pockets and bank accounts.  The homeless and the citizens lying on hospital trolleys are the victims of this type of behaviour.  Will the Taoiseach commit to the establishment of a commission of investigation into the sale of Project Eagle?  The Taoiseach should not fob me off by saying it is happening in another jurisdiction.  This is a national issue.  NAMA&rsquo;s Northern portfolio is a national asset belonging to the people of this State.</p></speech>

The famous report, A Vision for Change, dates back to 2006 and recommended an increase of 1,800 staff in mental health services.  By 2012, we were 23% below that recommendation.  In 2014, the suicide rate was 475.  That figure does not include the numbers who attempted to take their own lives or did themselves harm because of the continuing deprivation in mental health services.</p>  <p>  The reason the PNA gives for this serious ballot on strike action is that there is no clear plan from the Health Service Executive, HSE, on how to address this staffing crisis.  Staffing levels in child mental health services are down 50% and the staffing level in adult mental health services is only 75% filled.  The PNA says that there are 600 vacancies for psychiatric nurses and there will be another 400 within the next year because of retirements.  To stay at the current level would require an extra 1,000 nurses in the mental health services.  That does not include child psychiatrists and other therapists required.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will be asked many questions later about the programme for Government, but I want to use this opportunity to ask what the programme intends doing in this regard because in the mental health section it states it will implement A Vision for Change.</p><p>Given the level of crisis in terms of staff shortages and funding for mental health services alone, can the Taoiseach outline for the House what answer he will give to the Psychiatric Nurses' Association, PNA, the mental health services generally and those who require mental health services to address the chronic shortage in the service?  It seems to me that the programme for Government and HSE are failing to address this urgent crisis.</p></speech>

That is why the Government made clear this morning that the extra allocation to the Estimate for the Department of Health and the HSE will restore in full the ring-fenced moneys for mental health services.  The details of how they are to be located and spent will be outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, over the course of the discussions on the Estimates next week and the week after.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that there are some serious recruitment issues in respect of the problem to which the Deputy referred.  The Minister and Department are examining that question.  I can stand here and say that because of the increased strength in the economy, an adjustment will be made to deal with what was set out in the programme in terms of the allocation for the mental health area.  </p>  <p>  I spoke to people the other day with regard to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I find there is always a complication between psychologists and psychiatrists working for the HSE and Tusla when children might need services and things are to be contracted again.  The legal costs arising in areas surrounding children are always significant.</p>  <p>  Suicide and self-harm are very traumatic and sensitive issues that exist not just in any particular location in the country, but across every area.  The clinical programme for the assessment and management of self-harm in emergency departments provides a skilled response to people presenting with self-harm issues or suicidal ideation, as it is called, in emergency departments through a network of self-harm psychiatric nurses.  Some 24 of the 35 additional nurses available have been recruited to this programme and trained for the role, and are doing a very important job, as the Deputy is aware.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to further developing early intervention and prevention services.  I hope the extra allocation being made to the health area and the restoration of funding for the mental health area will benefit these persons greatly.  The details will be outlined by Ministers over the next week or so.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has failed to address my question.  If the PNA takes strike action on the issue of nurse shortages and the need to recruit at least 375 extra psychiatric nurses per year for the next few years, where will the money and determination come from?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach answered Deputy Martin's question about the extra funding that has been allocated to health, and said it would be allocated to existing services, overruns in acute hospitals, disability, home help services and mental health.  Many areas require funding before one even begins to examine the need to engage an extra 1,000 psychiatric nurses, according to the PNA, which is taking strike action because of that fact.</p></speech>

Obviously, I hope industrial action will not take place.  The Minister for Health met the association last Friday and is engaging with it.  Some of the issues that are being considered are the possibility of more training places for psychiatric nurses, bringing back a number of recently retired psychiatric nurses and continued efforts to attract nurses who have been working abroad back to Ireland  This is a genuinely serious problem and one that the Minister is working hard to grapple with.</p>  <p>  In 2015, almost 30,000 people were offered a first appointment and seen under A Vision for Change, the mental health strategy.  As Deputy Smith is aware, every emergency department has 24-7 access to mental health services.  Consultant psychiatrist and non-consultant hospital doctors in psychiatry working in general adult and old age psychiatric services, together with liaison psychiatry medical staff, provide an on-call service outside normal working hours.  It is largely focused on people presenting with urgent mental health problems.  </p>  <p>  The Government made a decision to adjust the Estimate in respect of the health Vote.  Funding for the mental health area is being fully restored.  Details will be outlined by Ministers and I am quite sure that the Deputy's input will be valuable to what is a serious argument.</p></speech>

In the next 30 years this figure will double.  It is vital that the current Government prepare for our ageing population.  It has been Government policy since 1960 to support older people to stay at home for as long as possible.  However, a recent report carried out by Age Action, the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and UCD, Meeting Older People's Preference for Care, found that acute hospitals and nursing homes are being prioritised over the kinds of community services that enable older people to remain in their homes.</p>  <p>  The report estimates that half of the older people spoken to in long-term residential care could live at home.  The number of people in nursing homes in Ireland is 35% greater than the EU average.  The report also states that community supports are disorganised, fragmented and underfunded.  It found that across all areas, the home help service available was minimal and ranged from less than an hour to a maximum of five hours a week, usually between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  The current programme for a partnership Government promises increased State support for the elderly and aims to keep older people independent and active while living in their communities.  It promises to improve supports and services for older people to enable them to live independently in their homes.  It aims to increase home care packages and home help hours every year.  In sharp contrast to these promises, the HSE said on 24 May 2016 that funds are now being rationed and more people will wait longer for home supports.  This is due to overspending on home help and home care packages in the first quarter of the year in order to free up beds and ease the pressure on hospital emergency departments.  </p>  <p>  There is an added fear that home help will be privatised.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm whether this is the case.  I strongly disagree with privatisation on the grounds that it is a business, rather than a care, model.  In other countries, such as Sweden, the privatisation of home help was found to have a negative impact on the standard of care provided, as the need for profit prevailed.</p>  <p>  The current programme promises additional funding for the nursing home support scheme in order to keep the waiting period for the fair deal scheme at approximately four weeks.  However, new figures from Nursing Homes Ireland revealed that waiting times for nursing home funding have doubled over the past three months.  Long waiting times can leave families struggling with a bill of &euro;15,000 before any funding is received.  This is completely unacceptable.  If waiting lists are not dealt with, I urge the Taoiseach to backdate payments for care from when an application was received until when it was approved.</p></speech>

It is the wish of the vast majority of people that they will be able to stay in their homes until such time as they have to become institutionalised.  That is why there has been a move from institutional and hospital care to community care.  That is why home care packages are so important and why the waiting list initiative and the fair deal scheme received substantial moneys in 2015, which resulted in a reduction in waiting list times from 18 to four or five weeks.</p><p> Deputy Michael Collins is correct in pointing out that the demographic pressures will increase in the future.  In fact, the population is projected to increase by 4% between 2016 and 2021, with the number of people in the 85 plus age group expected to rise by 4% between 2015 and 2016 alone.  As Deputy Collins is well aware, that cohort, or those much younger, can require extensive and expensive care.  That is the reason it is important for us to focus on primary care centres, community facilities and home-care packages that allow people to stay in their own homes as long as possible.</p> <p> Some time ago, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae made a point to me about the availability of Sunday care under home help and home care packages.  That is an issue the Minister will consider in the context of the extra adjustment made to the health budget.  I do not think anybody in the House would disagree with the concept of people being able to stay in their own place in their senior years for as long as is possible.  Why would that not be the case?  That is where the continued effort of Government will be.  The approach must take into account the pragmatic understanding that the population of the country is ageing and that every year brings a new cohort of those aged over 70 - as I pointed out in the context of those aged over 80, the consequences of that can be expensive - but it is very important that the State provides the very best level of support to people in their homes for as long as that is possible.  Advances in the treatment of chronic disease and expensive medical technologies can ease the discomfort of people and make it somewhat easier for them to stay at home for longer periods.  That is where the focus of the Government must be for that cohort.</p></speech>

I urge the Taoiseach to support the home help service as we know it.  The workers involved have tirelessly cared for the elderly.  Many of them only get 30 minutes to deal with an elderly person on a daily basis, to carry out numerous tasks and take many phone calls during the day in order to look after those in their care.  They are fighting a major battle against banked hours.  They have no work payment for the time spent going from client to client, even though a recent European ruling stated they should be paid for that time.  The home help service is willing to work days, nights and weekends but staff are refused hours and those hours are being given to private companies instead.  I and many others believe there should be a review of the management of the home help service in this country.  I call on the Taoiseach to start the process and by doing so to protect the future of the home help service and its delivery.</p></speech>

In some cases it can be very difficult to get personnel to manage the home care packages, depending on the nature of the complication or circumstances of individuals in need of home care.  The intention is to increase the extent of home care packages so that more people can stay out of hospital and be in their own place - kitchen, sitting room and bedroom - while they do not have to be institutionalised.  Everybody can agree with that approach.</p>  <p>  If it is of interest to Deputy Michael Collins, I am sure the Minister can arrange a briefing for him in respect of the area he represents and the particular issues to which he referred from first-hand knowledge.  The Minister will make that arrangement for the Deputy if he wishes to take him up on the offer.</p></speech>

The new Government has, therefore, established Cabinet committees on housing; health; social policy and public service reform; justice reform; European affairs; and regional and rural affairs.  At this morning's Cabinet meeting, the Government established three more Cabinet committees on the economy, trade and jobs; infrastructure, environment and climate action; and arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  In response to Questions Nos. 4 and 5, I have chaired six Cabinet committee meetings to date in 2016.  In January, I chaired a meeting of the committee on justice reform.  I chaired meetings of the Cabinet committee on housing on 12, 20 and 26 May and 2 June, and a meeting of the committee on health on 12 May.  The Cabinet committee on housing is scheduled to meet again tomorrow, 9 June.  Further Cabinet committee meetings will be scheduled over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to Question No. 7, the Government is setting up a new dedicated Cabinet committee which will deal with arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht.  It will be separate from the Cabinet committee on regional and rural affairs.  Therefore, in addition to being part of a larger Department headed by a senior Cabinet Minister, arts and culture will now have a separate dedicated Cabinet committee.  Some people seem to think otherwise but that is the way it is going to be.</p></reply>

Could the Taoiseach indicate whether that is more than was the case in the previous Government and by how many?</p>  <p>  The Government's response has been to establish a Cabinet sub-committee for the arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht because it has been rightly stung by the very sharp reaction from the arts community to what it sees as a consistent relegation and downgrading of the arts in public policy and Government policy in recent years, culminating in the formation of a very broad-ranging Department covering regional and rural affairs, the arts and the Gaeltacht.  The arts community further sensed that represented a yet greater diminution of the arts.  The idea of an arts, Irish and Gaeltacht sub-committee is clearly a response to that.  I welcome that in itself but it is a long way short of giving proper executive authority at ministerial level for the arts.  It is only a number of years ago that the arts had its own Department and portfolio.  That was something we celebrated as a country.  It was also something that had an impact on public policy itself.  It is fair to say that the arts today has a lower status in Government than at any time in more than three decades.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the fact that previously the arts had a Minister at senior level but now it is in a Department that is swamped by significant other duties in a wide range of areas.  The arts has been ignored at junior ministerial level.  Tens of thousands work in the arts sector, which is of extreme importance in terms of our values as a society.  It is also economically important.  I recall that at the first Global Irish Economic Forum in Farmleigh, all of the Irish CEOs who came from all over the world said that the one distinctive and distinguishing feature of Ireland was the arts and literature in terms of opening doors for trade, business and for the economy.  The Taoiseach must give the arts significant, direct ministerial representation in government.  It was a very serious omission and the Government is running to catch up now in terms of responding to the real sense of neglect that is felt.  It is not just about structures of Government, because in terms of arts policy in recent years and the centrality of the arts, there is a real sense that the arts have been left behind.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Cabinet sub-committee on health, it is difficult to understand what the health committee of the previous Cabinet did.</p><p>It presided over an overarching policy strategic objective and, at the end of five years, was obliged to admit defeat and state it did not really know what it was about for five years.  It was called universal health insurance and at the end of the five years, the Cabinet sub-committee on health was obliged to admit it did not know what it was talking about and did not have a clue regarding universal health insurance.  It was an abject failure and it dispensed with the policy.</p> <p> In many ways, the previous Cabinet sub-committee was a work of art in itself in avoiding action on delivering in any meaningful way the Government's programme for health as laid out in the programme for Government.  One hopes the newly formed Cabinet sub-committee on health will have a far more energetic and proactive content to its work.  The Taoiseach may recall the Government published a White Paper on health insurance, which went through the previous Cabinet sub-committee on health.  Can he indicate whether that White Paper on health insurance still is or remains official policy?  Alternatively, has it essentially being ditched and is the Government going back to the drawing board?</p> <p> Three years ago, the Taoiseach announced he was taking over direct responsibility for health.  He made that announcement here in a ringing declaration during Leaders' Questions on one occasion.</p></speech>

It appears to me as though the Taoiseach did not take personal charge of health for far too long.</p>  <p>  This has already been discussed during Leaders' Questions but the very fact the Government was obliged to produce &euro;500 million today, in the first week of June, illustrates real problems in policy formulation and policy-making in respect of health.  In 2014, there was a supplementary provision for &euro;680 million.  I called that a fraudulent budget in 2014, when a deliberately false budget was put before Members.  Moreover, Senator James Reilly himself subsequently more or less admitted that when he stated that the game was up for him when he did not win the battle at Cabinet on that health Estimate.  Last year, the supplementary provision was &euro;600 million.</p>  <p>  This year, before the health service plan was published, the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive, HSE, stated the HSE was under-provided.  The chief executive officer had sought &euro;2 billion in the lead-in to the Estimates and he stated the health service plan was under-provided, the HSE could not deliver additionality in services and all the health service could do would be to deliver 2015 levels of service.  I pointed out all this to the Government before Christmas.  I also pointed out in January that there would be real problems in the health service unless something gave.  Something has given today, with the provision of &euro;500 million.</p>  <p>  I still am unclear as to whether this is a sticking plaster of &euro;500 million that will deal with the pressures outlined at the beginning of the year or whether there will be additionality of services above 2015 levels of services in acute hospitals and so on.  It shocked me that such language stating that all that could be done in 2016 was to provide 2015 levels of service was used.  That has never happened before in any previous health provision or health Estimate.  It always was and by definition must be above the previous year's delivery of service for demographic reasons alone, never mind any additional services across the board.</p>  <p>  On the housing committee, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has confirmed that some targets will not now be met within the first 100 days.  There was a commitment to examine existing housing stock.  When will this be concluded?  How many houses will be renovated or refurbished by the end of the year to allow families to be moved out of hotels?  How often has that housing committee met and how regular will be its meetings?  The D&aacute;il committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Curran has done some good work.  It is nearing completion and the Taoiseach might indicate whether it is the Government's intention to fulfil and support, by implementation or by executive action, the recommendations of that all-party committee on housing.  I refer in particular to its intention of supporting the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to do that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the abandonment of the Economic Management Council, EMC, which is long overdue.</p></speech>

The rest of the Cabinet did not get to see much until it was a<i>fait accompli</i>.  It was an extraordinary way of doing business that essentially sidelined the Cabinet and one purpose it served was to shield from disclosure discussions on important matters of public interest.

When I came into the Chamber on the day the Government was appointed, I read out that because of all the pressure before the elections about rural affairs and regional affairs, that this should be reflected at Cabinet level and that this Department was one where that would be suitable.  Given that I read it out in that order, people suddenly assumed that the arts were gone, sunk without a trace.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>  <p>  The Department is to be the Department of Arts, Heritage and Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Development.  Consequently, those who have been writing to me, those who have been sending me texts and those who have been decrying the demise of the arts in Ireland at every opportunity should look again at the fact there now is more money in this Department, as well as more allocated to it, than for many years.  When I listen to all the learned people of creativity and imaginative vision speaking abroad about the demise of the arts in Ireland, I respectfully disagree.  This Department has a senior Cabinet Minister and a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee.  It has no Minister of State because of its importance and has more allocated to it than previously.</p>  <p>  Moreover, why would it not be important that regardless of whether one goes to Tory Island, Cill Rialaig, Dooagh down in Achill or any place else, that the capacity for people to be able to expound on their creativity and their imagination in the arts should be as prevalent as in any city centre or any major urban area?  The issue of rural development and regional development might be lost on some of those who espouse the vision about art because the young people are now displaying their artistic qualities in the schools and in the homes.  It might not be all on sketches or crayons or paints; it could be in many other artistic forms.  However, the Government must develop that regionally, locally and nationally and that is why more money has gone in here than previously.</p><p>In fact, the Government has increased funding for the Arts Council year on year since 2014, when the economy began to improve, to &euro;60 million now.</p> <p> Deputy Martin's question is valid.  The programme for Government contains an important commitment to increase funding for the arts progressively with specific reference to the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  I have had the privilege of meeting some of the global leaders in the film sector.  Many of them say that Ireland has an enormous capacity and potential in this area.  That is why the Government changed the rules in respect of the taxation system, the school of graphic design, and the capacity to produce major movies in studio, given that technology has changed greatly from what it was in the past.</p> <p> The outgoing Government commenced a &euro;30 million plus investment in the National Gallery a number of years ago.  One can see that the cranes have come and gone.  They have had to pile the entire foundations underneath and it will be a marvellous job when it is finished.  There was a further &euro;10 million investment for the National Library in Kildare Street, which was badly needed.  In addition, there was a &euro;9 million investment for arts and cultural centres, to run over the next three years, which is focused on increasing the number of arts and cultural centres.</p> <p> It is heartening and encouraging to work with local authority arts officers and see artistic centres throughout the country.  The scale of what they put on there locally, regionally and nationally is first class and to be much admired.  That scheme will target improvement of existing facilities.</p> <p> As Deputies know, a serious investment of &euro;32 million was made this year in the Military Archives, the development of the GPO interpretative centre, Kilmainham courthouse and the tenement buildings in the context of the comprehensive 1916 commemorations.  Much of that was related to the arts and artistic endeavour, so I do not accept the argument that the arts are being done down by the Government or that we have shown no interest in their potential and quality.</p> <p> A key theme of the centenary programme is re-imagining, which is a rallying call to re-imagine Ireland's future over the next 100 years.  That kind of conversation can be driven by our heritage and culture.  In tandem, the Government will prioritise the publication of Culture 2025, which is this country's first ever national cultural policy.</p> <p> On the second last occasion I was in New York, I visited an arts centre for a fund-raising event.  Let me assure those in the artistic community, both here and the many abroad with Irish connections, that this Government is fully committed to the arts.  In so far as we can, we will continue to fund that kind of imaginative vision that so many people have.</p> <p> A health question was mentioned and the new Minister has already set out a ten-year vision for the health service, for which he has obtained agreement from the House.  I hope that strategy will take significant elements of the raw politics out of this because everybody is interested in people having a proper health service as close to them as possible.  The initial advance of getting valid views from everybody about how this can operate is an important element of a national response to a health situation which has always been in crisis at one time or another.  We now face demographic problems with an ageing population and chronic illnesses.  People are living longer because of newer and better treatments.  Given the rising population of 4.7 million, there is therefore an increased cost.</p> <p> The Minister for Health will continue to roll out primary care centres, while mental health issues and other elements are also important.  Deputy Martin referred to other issues.  Additional Exchequer funding of almost &euro;817 million was made available to support health and social care services in 2016.  That included an extra &euro;100 million to maintain existing services and &euro;99 million for new services which cover therapy services for young people.  It includes speech and language therapy which is an issue that people have constantly raised, as well as the Creating a Healthy Ireland programme.  It also concerns building capacity for our emergency and acute services, improving waiting times for hospital procedures, reforming the HSE into a more efficient, transparent health service for patients and staff, and developing a new funding model for health services.</p> <p> Deputy Martin asked if the health system will stay within its budget for 2016, which is a valid question.  I hope so.  There is a far greater emphasis now on accountability, transparency and effective management from senior HSE personnel, particularly those working in acute hospitals where overruns have been a constant issue.</p> <p> In addition to providing speech and language therapy services for young people, further development of mental health services will be undertaken.  Primary care, including provision of free GP care for six to 11 year olds, will also be provided along with the development of maternity services, ambulances and hospital projects.  Deputy Martin is aware of the development of the new national children's hospital, as well as efforts to resolve the dispute in respect of the National Maternity Hospital, along with an extensive capital programme for better facilities in many hospitals throughout the country.  These are all important matters.</p> <p> Deputy Martin mentioned the Economic Management Council or EMC.  Just over five years ago when the previous Government was elected, the economic situation was catastrophic.  One of the things we felt strongly about, which was no reflection on Deputy Martin-----</p></speech>

For whatever reason - I am not going to cast aspersions on anybody - that was not happening.  The Government I led from 2011 comprised two parties and therefore there were different views on various things.  Given the scale of the economic situation we faced, it was necessary to talk about things daily.  The EMC was never a Cabinet in itself, but it was a way of short-circuiting arguments into a cohesive proposal that had to be accepted or rejected by the Government afterwards.</p>  <p>  The publication of all these papers will come as a measure of the shortened time for the publication of Cabinet papers anyway.  It is therefore not necessary now to have an Economic Management Council, as the country is not in an economic crisis.  We are heading towards deficit and debt reduction, rising employment, and much lower interest rates available to us to borrow money.  In that sense, I have no intention of restoring, nor do I wish to bring back to life, the Economic Management Council.  It has gone; it is history.  It played an important part in the vehement and difficult discussions on decisions that were to be made concerning both budgets and the situation that applied at European level.  That is one the Deputy does not have to worry about for the future.  The papers and decisions arising from recommendations of the EMC of those years will be published in due course.  There is now a shortened time for the publication of Cabinet papers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-08a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800023#V00400"><p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och den Taoiseach as a fhreagra.  He obviously believes the system of Cabinet sub-committees is an important structure to help to develop policy and give political direction to the Departments involved.  I can see why that is the case.  I myself believe that a core group or a focused approach by those who know the ins and outs of the particular issue at hand could help to drive policy.  Is that the record, however, and is that how it has worked out?</p>  <p>  I am very taken by this notion of the health committee.  In the last days of the previous Government, the money which we were told was ring-fenced for the mental health budget was taken away.  I know it has been restored and I welcome that, but it was actually taken away then.</p><p>Where was the health committee dealing with this issue?  The then Minister of State, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, railed against it, but it was still taken away from the people who deserve even more in terms of resources, structure and policy direction.  Here is the rub: the Taoiseach uses Cabinet confidentiality to not answer my question about that.  Was that issue discussed at the health sub-committee?  Did it take the decision?  Who took the decision?  Was it the Cabinet?  That is a very serious, recent and timely example of the track record of one of those committees.</p> <p> I also take issue with the Taoiseach railing eloquently against those who he says have said that the arts are in decline.  I never heard anybody who is interested in the arts say that.  The arts are not in decline.  The issue is that they are not given the required priority, funding or resources in terms of Government and public policy.  That is the rub.  It is no accident - I applaud this and get great enjoyment from it, as do most people - that when we wish to showcase the Centenary celebrations or anything else about this island, we do so artistically.  We involve our best creative and visual artists, singers, songwriters and musicians.  The Taoiseach frequently draws on some of our great poets.  In flights of fancy he will draw on sections from our literature or drama.  We all try to do it in a way, because that is part of what we are and part of our expression.  As the arts bring enjoyment, uplift people and let people live in their imagination, they should be supported.  There is a need for a dedicated Minister, even a Minister of State, to have that responsibility.</p> <p> The arts are also an economic driver across a range of areas.  The vast majority of people do not visit this country to look at great factories or the signs of industrialisation that might exist.  Some people might come here to look at farms or agriculture, but most people come to this country to look at heritage or historical sites.  When they want a night out they go to the theatre, a book reading, a ballad session or a concert.  All of that can drive the economy and generate a real return.  I must declare an interest as I am a voluntary director of F&eacute;ile an Phobail, which has uplifted the people of west Belfast both in terms of the creative genius of those people and also in terms of outreach to people of different views across Belfast.  It also provides a platform whereby artists can come into the community and engage with it.  Many young people from west Belfast are now earning a living through the arts.  There is no point in the Taoiseach being dismissive of our concerns.  The real concern is that the Government is not giving the arts or heritage the type of priority and importance they deserve.</p> <p> In the context of trying to ascertain the detail of what takes place in these sub-committees, does the Government intend to retain the use of Cabinet confidentiality?  There is a big difference in how often Cabinet sub-committees meet.  The Taoiseach told us several years ago that when he became Taoiseach he found that Cabinet sub-committees used to meet on an irregular basis, so he decided to allocate one day per month exclusively for Cabinet sub-committees.  Is it his intention to continue that practice?  I can understand that a sub-committee with responsibility for dealing with an emergency situation might need to meet more often.  However, the Cabinet sub-committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht met on only two occasions in the first six months of 2014.  The Taoiseach is i bhfad n&iacute;os l&iacute;ofa n&aacute; mise and has a fluidity in Irish that I admire.  Given that he is a f&iacute;or-Ghaeilgeoir, I cannot understand why the Government is not more active on the Irish language issue and, in particular, on the economic regeneration of Gaeltacht communities, which are the cultural well of our language.</p> <p> Does the Taoiseach intend to continue the practice of devoting one day per month to the Cabinet sub-committees and will he respond to the other issues I have raised, particularly relating to the work of the outgoing health committee, which presumably allowed, or was not consulted on, the removal of money that was ring-fenced for mental health services?</p></speech>

There was an issue with the recruitment of personnel and their availability.  Some of them could not be recruited in the timescale that was originally set, and that is the reason the money was diverted, but it has now been restored.

However, I notice that there are questions in the House that ask very directly about issues that were discussed at Cabinet sub-committee meetings, and I cannot not say that these issues were not raised or discussed.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy about the arts.  Einstein said that imagination is the greatest force, and it is true that that is how we project Ireland on the international stage or for ourselves.  Is it not the excitement of the hurling or football match that creates a passion among Irish people?  I recall attending the Eurovision Song Contest years ago, when Riverdance was presented in its final magnificence.  There was a stunned silence before an explosion of welcome for something that was as old as Ireland but had been translated into a modern presentation of something we are ourselves.  That was an expression of art that was viewed by 200 million people in China, and by many others when Michael Flatley, Jean Butler and all the other dancers and backup groups did their thing on the world stage.</p>  <p>  We provided &euro;500,000 last year for the Yeats centenary in Sligo.  Consider the numbers who came there from abroad because of the power of that person to write what people were thinking - their thought streams addressed in a way that they might not be able to do themselves but in a way they could understand.  That is a part of Irish art as well.  Walk through Cill Rialaig on a bad day to Bolus Head and feel the power of the environment, the artists who worked there and the light streaming through the windows and the roof.  These are things we present to China, Japan, America and other countries.  I had the privilege a few weeks ago of launching the Ireland 100 in the Kennedy Centre in Washington before 2,500 people.  Some of our country's most artistic singers, dancers, creators and musicians were presenting their ability to the world.  Of course we present these things.  Why would we not?  I agree with the Deputy.  The first word in this Department title is "Arts."</p></speech>

We want more and more young people to learn from their elders and connect with their peers around the world through the Internet.  Is that not why we need broadband in rural areas?  It is so they can talk to schools in Auckland, Alaska or South America and ask students there about their music, games, food and dress and what they do.  Is this not where the young Irish stand on a stage without peers?  It is so we can stand with our young people and tell them they can more than compete with anything else the world has to offer.</p> <p> This is why regional and rural affairs are and should be part of the artistic community.  It is in there that the educational forces will give vent to those young people's imagination and inspiration.  Long after we are all gone our way out of this House, that legacy will continue to flourish - "full many a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air".  </p></speech>

This is the waste that generates profit through recycling.  The proposal was then retracted by the new Minister with responsibility for housing, planning and local government.  We now find that the big cartel companies, Thorntons Recycling and Greyhound Recycling, are doubling and tripling the standing annual charge for households to have their bins collected.  I have e-mails from workers in Ballyfermot and Crumlin who have received e-mails from Greyhound and Thorntons asking them to pay three times what they paid previously in the annual standing charge to have their bins collected.  Customers pay that regardless of whether they ever put out a bin, when they put out a bin or what it weighs.  In addition to pay by weight, which will be introduced on 1 July 2016, these new charges will be introduced on that date.  These two companies operate like a cartel because if they were genuinely in competition with each other, they would not put up the prices in exactly the same manner at exactly the same time.  James Gandolfini has been dead for nearly three years but Tony Soprano is alive and well in the waste management industry.</p>  <p>  We will see many of these issues arise because of the privatisation of an essential service.  This is what one gets when one commodifies the application of an essential service, and the collection of rubbish is essential to the running of any country.  It was introduced in the 1800s because of the widespread incidence of cholera in our cities so we had a public waste management service.  We now have a private waste management service.  Illegal dumping is increasing and will increase even further with these costs because people are put to the pin of their collar just to have their bins collected.  This is outrageous and must be illegal.  We need a waste management sub-committee to look at this and the planned building of incinerators in Poolbeg and Cork.</p>  <p>  This issue is pressing and we need to deal with it.  Somebody needs to grab these companies, bring them in and tell them that they cannot bring in a 200% or 300% cost increase for something that is essential for people to live.  Otherwise, illegal dumping will increase and it will be the local authorities who will pick up the tab, not the private companies who are making the profit.  This is why we argue that we need to rescind the section of the Waste Management Act that allowed the privatisation of waste management.  We should bring it back into public control and ensure that even if it is paid for, it is monitored and regulated and companies can like this cannot behave in a Soprano-like fashion, do what they like with the bin service and charge people an arm and a leg.  I would like the Taoiseach to comment on it and I sincerely urge him to consider having a Cabinet waste management sub-committee even for a limited time.</p></speech>

Implementing the programme over the lifetime of the Government will involve a range of activity involving all Government Departments.  My Department is engaging with all Departments at present to identity individual commitments and determine responsibility for these actions.  These will be published in due course by each Department in their respective statements of strategy.</p>  <p>  As part of the process, I am meeting with individual Ministers to agree their priorities for the coming year taking into account the actions and ambitions in the programme for a partnership Government.  To date, I have met with eight Ministers and I will meet with a further two tomorrow.  The programme for a partnership Government sets out a new and collaborative approach in doing business not only including the partners of Government, but the Oireachtas and wider society.</p>  <p>  There are many challenges ahead, including areas such as housing and homelessness, education and health, broadband and rural development.  The Government is committed to tackling these challenges head on to ensure that we build a society where the recovery is felt by every individual and family around the country.  The programme for Government office in my Department will monitor the implementation of the programme and report to me and to the Cabinet on progress across all Government Departments.  An annual report will be published after the first year outlining progress made.</p></reply>

I am still really confused and am getting more confused by the day as to whether this section is to be implemented.  It concerns the linkage of child benefit with school attendance.  I raised the issue earlier because I was shocked to see such a right-wing proposal in what is being called a &quot;new politics&quot; programme for Government that would penalise people who rely on child benefit to send their children to school and remove it if their children do not attend school.  There is a lot of evidence to show that children do not attend school for many reasons.  It is not because their parents are spending the money in the gambling shop or pub and do not give a damn about them.  It is often because they have issues relating to disability or are being bullied or because their special needs are not being met at school.  They are often related to economic and developmental problems in the family.  Penalising those families by removing child benefit will do little or nothing to address the attendance of children at school.</p><p>I was shocked to see it.  Subsequently, I think the Minister for Social Protection said in this House - he certainly said it in front of me on RTE - that he was not in favour of this measure.  I believe he then said in this House that the measure would not be implemented.  This morning's edition of the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>reported that the Minister with responsibility for communications, climate change and natural resources, an &quot;Endapendent&quot; whose baby this is because he is the one who has been promoting it, said that this is not going away, that he is going to put it to the floor of the House and that he believes he has enough support among Deputies, parents and teachers to implement it.  I am particularly concerned that he believes he has the support of a majority of teachers.  I do not know from where he gets that evidence.</p><p>Could the Taoiseach, the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister with responsibility for communications, climate change and natural resources clarify who is telling the truth here?  Will the measure to link school attendance and child benefit be implemented under the programme for a partnership Government?  Will the Minister with responsibility for communications, climate change and natural resources pursue this issue on the floor of this House despite the Minister for Social Protection's pronouncement that it will not be pursued?</p></speech>

The best education that can be given to children and young people gives them the best opportunity to find a pathway out of difficult circumstances and poverty, a route to find a job and, therefore, the ability to live a life.</p><p>There was misinterpretation involved here.  The intention is not to take child benefit away from people; it is to ensure that children, in whatever circumstances, are enabled to have the same opportunity as anybody else.  The Deputy is quite right that in many different circumstances in places around the country, it is not as simple as it looks.  There may well be personal, family, partner or extended family issues.  It may be personal to the child and his or her difficulties and no service is being made available to that child.  The important point, which was highlighted by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is that child benefit is a fundamentally important element of welfare in Ireland - the Minister for Social Protection has made it that way - but so is school education.  Therefore, supports need to be available so that every child can have the opportunity to go to school to learn and to better himself or herself.  That requires, in many cases, dealing with a situation where, for whatever reason, some children do not attend school.</p></speech>

The programme for legislation on the Water Services Bill proposes "To suspend the water charges for nine months and establish an External Advisory Body", and it states "Pre-Legislation Scrutiny to be determined".  The establishment of an external advisory body in the same legislation as the suspension of water charges is not part of the original agreement.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that it is the Government's intention to fulfil the letter and spirit of the agreement and that the legislation to suspend domestic water charges for a period of nine months will be introduced to deal with the current billing cycle and will not have any other additions?  If the provision to "establish an External Advisory Body" is put in, it will delay unnecessarily the legislation to suspend water charges and it will not happen within the six week timeframe.  Whatever the Department or anybody else wants, there is a very clear political agreement in terms of legislation to suspend water charges for a period of nine months and I would appreciate the Taoiseach's confirmation that it is the Government's intention to do that.</p>  <p>  There is also a commitment in the programme for Government that "Full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust".  That is the Stardust fire inquiry.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if there is any new evidence available and if there are plans to commence an inquiry because the language in the programme for Government is extremely difficult to understand?  It is difficult to ascertain what direction it is pointing towards.  </p>  <p>  The national disability inclusion strategy is in the programme for Government.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether it has commenced and what format it will take?  The disability sector is in a huge state of crisis in terms of access to services.  All the providers are in dire straits in terms of financial allocations, moneys available to them, respite, residential and day cases, and the provision of therapies.  It is in a crisis and I do not think there is an appreciation of that at Government level.  </p>  <p>  We wish all students who have commenced the leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations our best wishes and every success and that they achieve their best within their potential.  There have been cuts applied in recent years in DEIS schools which resulted in more vulnerability in students in disadvantaged areas.  There is an interesting commitment in the programme for Government, on which the Taoiseach might throw some light, "to narrow the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools, and examine how students outside of DEIS can be better supported".  Will the Taoiseach indicate what the Government has in mind for that?</p></speech>

In view of the timeframe, the impending legislation will concentrate on the suspension of water charges as per the programme for Government and as per the agreement with Deputy Martin's party.  The impending legislation will concentrate on dealing with the question of the suspension of the water charges for nine months and the Government is fully committed to legislating for the external advisory body.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin mentioned disability which is covered on page 70 and 71 of the programme for Government.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has a very extensive budget and will obviously deal with the issues that Deputy Martin has quite rightly raised.  I will have the Minister for Education and Skills respond to Deputy Martin on the narrowing of the range between DEIS and non-DEIS schools. </p></speech>

The High Court ruled on Moore Street three weeks ago and the order will come into full effect in two weeks unless the Minister or developer appeals the decision.  The court recognised, as has the National Museum, the historic importance of Moore Street.  There is growing concern that the Minister is planning to appeal the High Court decision.  Will the Taoiseach make clear that will not be the case?  Will he ask the Minister to ensure the battlefield site is part of any updated national heritage plan?  Will he state the Government's opposition to any proposal to extend planning permission to any developer?</p>  <p>  The programme for Government states the Government will "honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine".  The Taoiseach will recollect the Oireachtas voted in accordance with that commitment.  Last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, participated in a conference in Paris to prepare for a peace conference later this year.  That is just a little flicker of hope against a background of a peace process which really does not exist.  The conditions for Palestinian families in the West Bank and Gaza are worsening.  The recent reports have exposed the use by the Israeli forces of forced expulsions, home demolitions, thefts and settlement construction.  In the first three months of 2016, the number of demolitions per month of either private property or international or EU funded projects increased to 165.  We need to show leadership on this issue.  I have said this many times.  Will the Government recognise the state of Palestine now and not at some vague point in the future?  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to brief Opposition spokespersons on the Paris conference? </p></speech>

It might be no harm if we had a debate on the Palestinian situation in due course.  It is an issue of considerable importance to Irish people.  I was in New York when the Palestinian flag was flown over the United Nations headquarters for the first time.  Obviously, most countries recognise a two-state solution to the conflict, which has gone on since 1948 or shortly thereafter.  The boundaries have changed and are being changed on a fairly regular basis.  I will ask the Minister to brief Deputy Adams.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Moore Street monument.  The judge has given his verdict in this case, and it is a long judgment.  The Minister has not decided to appeal the case, but it might be necessary to seek clarification on one element of the judgment not about the right of the State or the Minister of the day to declare an entity a national monument, but about the judge's finding on what the State's rights are in carrying out work on a national monument in terms of restoring it, rectifying it or whatever.  As I understand it, it is not a matter of wanting to appeal the case.  There is a requirement for clarification in order for the State to do work it might wish to do in respect of any national monument - not just the one on Moore Street - and that is an issue the judge identified in his judgment.  That needs to be clarified in the interest of the State's being able to do work, and fund it, on any monument in the time ahead.  When I get an absolute decision, I will advise the House.</p></speech>

With regard to two functions of Government, namely, the post office network and the national broadband service, what exactly is the Government's intention?  Will statutory responsibility for those two programmes - post offices and broadband - be vested in the Department of communications, climate change and natural resources or the Department of rural development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht?  If not, and if the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources is to continue to be responsible for these matters, as I believe the Ministers and secretaries legislation requires him to be, what role then is envisaged for the Minister for rural development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys?  Is she to exercise any authority under law or is she simply to have some sort of mock title with no resources, no staff, no Vote and no statutory responsibility for these issues?</p>  <p>  I asked the T&aacute;naiste last week about the second matter I want to raise, which is becoming more urgent.  Will the Government produce a stability programme update, SPU?  Will a SPU be submitted to the European Commission?  This morning, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, commented on the April SPU, which the Taoiseach will recall was simply an "as you are" SPU devised by the outgoing Government, with no policy decisions because we could not make them.  Increases in Estimates have been made to Departments, so if changes are to be made in the parameters of the budget, will an SPU be submitted, and when will we have sight of it?  We do not know what the Estimates for this year are, although the SPU is devised to represent the parameters for next year's budget.  If we are to have any input into the budgetary cycle for next year, we must have detailed debate on the budgetary proposals for this year.  When will those Estimates and a Revised Book of Estimates be presented to the House?</p></speech>

That is for 2016.  The national economic discourse will take place on 24 or 25 June in Dublin Castle, hosted by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and with a full debate here as well.  The preparation for the 2017 Estimates and the budget for 2017 will commence after the Estimates have been signed off for 2016 and voted through the House.</p>  <p>  Second, on the question Deputy Howlin raised about broadband with respect to the two Ministers, he is quite correct.  The position is that the management of the tender and the contract for the State to supply broadband services throughout the country is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and will remain the responsibility of that Minister.  When the contract has been awarded, the emphasis shifts to the Minister for regional and rural affairs, who will have responsibility for the roll-out of task forces in each local authority to make that happen.  The responsibility for the contract, the tender and all of that work lies with the Minister for communications, while the roll-out of the contract and the task forces in each local authority area will be the responsibility of the Minister for regional and rural affairs.</p></speech>

He must agree that the expectation and demand among a growing number of people is for equality in education, and one would have thought that the priority of the Minister would be to outlaw discrimination against children on the basis of their religion.  I wonder if the Taoiseach read Colette Browne's article.  I am not one for plugging the <i>Irish Independent</i>, but I do on this occasion.  The headline states that children will pay the price for surrender on the baptism barrier.  I ask the Taoiseach to re-examine that, because the Bill we are hearing about would lead to the segregation of children several times a week - at least once a day - for religious instruction.  It has been well proven that this carries into the playground, where children cluster into groups with those of their own ethnic background.  Is the Taoiseach going for the easy option in regard to this, the one he believes the Catholic Church will accept and that will not rock its boat?  Is he aware that only two schools were divested by the Catholic Church since this entire process was mooted under the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn?  It would seem there is no appetite on behalf of the Catholic Church to surrender control, but it is accepting this as the best situation it can get, and it seems to be well disposed to it.  However, it has been pointed out by Atheist Ireland that the consequence of the Bill is that it could make the situation worse because some Catholic schools would become less Catholic-----</p></speech>

Other schools will become more Catholic, but what we could see is schools not being available to those who have no faith.

The Archbishop of Dublin pointed out that the Catholic Church has too many schools and wishes to divest numbers of these to other patrons, whether that was Educate Together or whatever.  That process did not measure up to the targets that the Minister had in mind because of practical difficulties and circumstances in different places around the country.</p>  <p>  It is perfectly in order for any patron to express the wish to have its ethos in its own school.  It is important to note that is the issue here.  The basic aim of the Government is to use economic success to create a fair and compassionate society, and education is involved as one of the areas in that regard.  The Government is anxious to provide more choice for parents and we are determined to make it easier for parents, particularly parents whose children are not Catholic, to enrol their children in multidenominational schools where they wish to do so.  That is why the programme for Government commits to reaching 400 non-denominational and multidenominational schools by 2030.  That is an ambitious target and it represents more than a tripling of the current rate of transfer of Catholic schools to multidenominational patrons.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has articulated a strategy for how he plans to deliver on that and he wants to implement it.  Providing additional multidenominational schools is the quickest and most straightforward way of dealing with the very complex issue of providing choice for parents.  It is important to note that this issue only arises in respect of 20% of schools that are oversubscribed.</p></speech>

For the information of Deputy Coppinger, we are advised that there would potentially be very significant constitutional issues in terms of the rights of religious expression in attempting to require through legislation that a Catholic school would admit a non-Catholic ahead of a Catholic.  Therefore, rather than risk lengthy legal challenges in the courts and a potential referendum, adding multidenominational schools would be a much easier way to deal with this right of choice for parents.</p></speech>

Will he take the opportunity to correct the record on that particular issue?  We have not had a referendum on it for 30 years and there are different elements.</p></speech>

That was the approval of the urgent drafting of legislation to enhance the powers of the commission of investigation into IBRC along the lines of a general scheme that we discussed, together with all the consequent challenges that lie therein.  Second, the Government noted the approach proposed regarding the revision of the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation following consultations by me and Ministers with members of the Opposition parties.  We discussed the drafting of legislation to allow for this in modular form, to have terms of reference to allow an investigation into the Siteserv issue, which is a matter of public concern raised here on many occasions, and the allowing of future modules to be inserted into that, if necessary.  Approval was given for that this morning.</p></speech>

The money has been restored in full for what was originally intended for mental health and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will outline the details of how it is to be spent.  With regard to recruitment, there will be a focus on attracting psychiatric nurses back to Ireland and more places for psychiatric nursing training.</p>  <p>  I answered a question to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith last week on the eighth amendment.  This was put into the Constitution in 1983 and in February 1992 there was a Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  In 1992, there was also a referendum to reverse the X case judgment and that referendum was defeated, and there was also a referendum on the right to travel, which was passed.  In the same year there was a referendum on the right to information, which was also passed.  In 2002, there was a referendum to reverse the X case judgment and that was narrowly defeated.  I am just getting the chronological sequence right.</p>  <p>  Although I know it is not the Deputy's intention to have this treated in any way as a political football, it is a sensitive and profound issue that must be teased out very carefully with regard to action that might be taken by the people.  There would be a citizens' assembly and the D&aacute;il process to establish it if there is a consensus for change.  That is very necessary and what I intend to do.</p></speech>

They were not consulted on any possible rescue package.  They are public servants, identical to the other 250 staff entitled to a public service pension.  It is an awful position for those people.

As Deputy Healy-Rae is aware, when directives are signed off, they are binding.

Using his own fingers, the Taoiseach can tell that although the money has not been cut, the 4% year-on-year increase in demand for the service is cutting the money and we need to get more money into that scheme to try to provide some kind of dignity, as the cost of a nursing home is &euro;1,100 a week.</p></speech>

At the outset, it should be noted that the Bill is very much of a technical nature and is designed primarily to address an international obligation arising from the banking union agenda.  The basis for the Bill is the requirement to put in place bridge financing<font color="#FF0000"> </font>arrangements to the Single Resolution Fund.  This was triggered by the statement of 18 December 2013 adopted by Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers on the funding of the single resolution board.  It required, especially in the early years, that member states participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism should put in place a system by which bridge financing would be available as a last resort and in full compliance with state aid rules.  It was also stated that such arrangements should be in place by the time the Single Resolution Fund becomes operational.</p><p>The Single Resolution Fund is the financing element of the Single Resolution Mechanism, which is designed to provide, within a banking union context, a centralised resolution system which will be applied in a uniform fashion across all participating member states.  The Single Resolution Mechanism is the second pillar of the banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the Single Supervisory Mechanism faced serious difficulties, its resolution could be managed efficiently with minimal costs to taxpayers and the real economy through the application of resolution tools such as bail-in and the use of a Single Resolution Fund, which is financed by the banking sector.</p><p>The target level for the Single Resolution Fund is at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all of the participating member states, which is to be reached at the end of eight years.  This is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 billion.  During the transition period to full mutualisation, the fund will operate through national compartments into which member states will transfer the contributions collected from their banking sectors.</p><p>In practice what this means is that should a bank be put into resolution and the bail-in, which involves the write down of a minimum of 8% of the bank's equity, capital instruments and eligible liabilities, proves insufficient to cover the losses, the next step will be the provision of funding from the national compartment of the affected member state.  If there are still losses to be absorbed after this step, funds are then obtained from the mutualised elements of other national compartments.  There is also the option for the single resolution board to borrow from the market to cover losses, but depending on the scale and circumstances, this may not always be possible.  As a result, the single resolution board may find itself in a situation, particularly in the early years, where after the bail-in process has been completed and the resolution waterfall process has been exhausted, there are still losses to be absorbed.  In such a situation, it will require an alternative source of financing and it has been agreed by the Council of EU Finance Ministers that this should take the form of national credit lines.</p><p>Most member states have either already put this in place or are about to do so, as there was a commitment following European Finance Ministers' agreement on the approach last December that this needed to be in place by 1 January 2016.  It is crucial we progress the Bill as quickly as possible in order for Ireland to meet its banking union obligations.</p><p>The consequence of not signing the loan agreement with the single resolution board is that should an Irish bank get into financial trouble before the enactment of the legislation, then the funding available to the Single Resolution Fund will come from the small amount in the Irish national compartment, in the region of &euro;70 million transferred from the national resolution fund for 2015, and the mutualised elements of the other national compartments, also only a very small amount, and any borrowing that the single resolution board can carry out.  However, if this should prove insufficient, then there will be no fall-back source of financing from the single resolution board as the national credit line will not be in place.</p><p>It is important to point out that our banks are currently well capitalised and in general good health.  Therefore, I believe the likelihood of this loan facility agreement ever being called upon is minimal.  However, the provision of this national backstop to the single resolution board is key from a confidence perspective as it provides another indication to the market that the banking union member states are serious about ensuring stability in their banking sector.</p><p>I want to provide Members with a short introduction to the loan facility agreement between the State and the single resolution board.  The loan facility agreement is an individual agreement between each participating member state<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and the single resolution board in relation to the credit line that it commits to provide to it where the need for bridge financing arises.  The terms and conditions of each agreement are broadly speaking identical aside from the amount to be requested from each member state.</p><p>The loan facility agreement provides that the maximum aggregate amount to be provided by all member states is &euro;55 billion.  To determine the share of each participating member state, it was agreed to use the relative size of each member state's compartment in the Single Resolution Fund using the estimate of the European Commission as of 27 November 2014.  This constitutes the allocation key between participating member states for determining the respective credit lines.  In this regard it should be noted that Ireland's key is 3.3% of the &euro;55 billion, which equals &euro;1.815 billion.</p><p>During the negotiation of the loan facility agreement, two issues emerged: whether it should be possible to pay a credit line in tranches rather than all at once, and whether national approval was required to pay a credit line to the single resolution board.  If member states were willing to forgo flexibility on these two points, the board would pay an annual fee of 0.1% of their credit line.  In the case of Ireland this fee, known as a commitment fee, would equal &euro;1.8 million per annum.  The Minister for Finance consulted the NTMA on this point.  It advised that the flexibility whereby the State can pay the loan in tranches over a 19-day period, except in exceptional circumstances, is worth forgoing the commitment fee.  In addition, the credit line will also require national approval which will ensure there is appropriate national oversight.</p><p><b></b>An amendment will be introduced on Committee Stage providing for an additional Part to the Bill.  The Department of Finance is currently transposing the recent European market abuse regulations and market abuse directive into Irish law.  On legal advice, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will bring an amendment to the Companies Act 2014, by way of the Bill, to refer explicitly to the new European market abuse regime in section 1365 of that Act.  This will ensure the continuation of the existing offences and high-level penalties of up to &euro;10 million in fines, or up to ten years' imprisonment on indictment, or both, for insider trading and market manipulation.</p><p>I will now go into more detail about the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is short, consisting of eight sections, and captures the key points of the loan facility agreement between the State and the single resolution board.  Section 2 provides that the Minister for Finance can perform any functions necessary for the purposes of the State's performing its functions under the loan facility agreement.  Section 3 provides the legal basis for the payment of money from the Exchequer to the single resolution board.  Section 4 sets out the circumstances in which the Exchequer may make a payment of money to the single resolution board.  Section 5 sets out the legal basis for facilitating a payment by the single resolution board to the State.  Section 6 requires the Minister for Finance to provide an annual report to the D&aacute;il with information on the value of any loans and repayments made.  Section 7 enables any expenses incurred by the Minister for Finance to be covered by moneys provided by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>I will now outline the main paragraphs of the terms of the loan facility agreement, which is the Schedule to the Bill.  Paragraphs 2 and 3 state the maximum amount of the loan, &euro;1.815 billion, and the purpose for which the loan may be used.  Paragraphs 4 and 5 set out how the single resolution board must apply for the loan, the details of the loan, the timeframe for the lender to respond and the making of the loan.  Paragraph 6 sets out the conditions around repayment of the loan, and states that in circumstances in which not enough <i>ex post </i>contributions have been made to repay the loan in two years, the loan can be extended by one year.  Paragraph 7 sets the out the conditions on the prepayment of a loan.  Paragraph 8 sets the conditions for the setting of the interest rate on the loan.  Paragraph 9 states that no commitment fee shall be payable by the single resolution board to the State.<br/><br/>The Minister for Finance chose to forgo a commitment fee of 0.1%, or &euro;1.8 million per annum, in return for greater flexibility after consultation with the NTMA.  In return for the forgoing of the commitment fee, the credit line will require national approval rather than being automatic.  Another benefit is that the State can pay the loan amount in tranches over a 19-day period, barring in exceptional circumstances where the single resolution board needs to avert the immediate default of an entity under resolution and would require more than 50% of the loan facility agreement.<br/><br/>Paragraph 11 describes the information sharing requirements and sets out that the State should inform the single resolution board if any event occurs that may prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this agreement.  It also allows the State, the single resolution board, the European Commission and the European Stability Mechanism to exchange information relevant to this agreement where the State has requested or received stability support.  Paragraph 12 contains a provision that national approval must be sought by the State within three days of a pre-notification request from the single resolution board, and outlines a number of procedural items in relation to the operation of the agreement.  Paragraphs 14 to 18 set out various technical provisions such as payment mechanics, confidentiality agreements, interest calculations and disclosure requirements.  Paragraph 19 sets out how the State may pledge security to the European Stability Mechanism in the event that the State enters stability support.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would like again to emphasise the importance of the early passage of this Bill to enable the implementation of significant parts of the EU banking union legislative agenda.  It will also ensure that Ireland meets its banking union obligations as agreed with other Member States involved in banking union.  In addition, the Committee Stage amendment to the Companies Act will ensure that Ireland maintains a robust regime against market abuse, with high levels of penalties, both in fines and in custodial terms.  I commend the Bill to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I congratulated him personally but I also wish to do so across the floor of the House.  I got to know the Minister of State quite well when he was a member of the banking inquiry, and I am sure we will have a good working relationship across the floor of the House.  I wish him all the best in his new role, which is a very exciting opportunity for him.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill 2016 in the Oireachtas.  We do so as it is primarily technical legislation to facilitate the process of banking union, which is already well in train.  The concept of a Single Resolution Mechanism and the associated Single Resolution Fund brings about a sea change in how banks will be supervised and regulated in Europe.  Never again should a situation arise in which the authorities in an individual state are forced by the European Central Bank to use taxpayers&rsquo; money to prop up the banking sector in that country without assistance from fellow member states.  An entirely new process is now in place which would mean that, in the event of a banking collapse, there will be a clear cascade of interventions.  Equity holders would be first to lose out, followed by subordinated bondholders, various categories of senior bondholder, corporate depositors and, finally, uninsured deposits.  In theory, the resolution fund only kicks in after all stages have been gone through.</p><p>The consequence of the new resolution arrangements is that investors and depositors are considerably more at risk than they were previously.  Indeed, the outline structure was tested during the Cypriot banking crisis of 2013 when uninsured depositors lost out to the tune of 48% in the case of one bank, the Bank of Cyprus.  This is something that needs to be considered carefully by individuals and institutions when deciding where to put their money.  It is imperative that the system of regulation be sufficiently robust to identify weak banks and require them to take remedial action when potential warning signs are identified.  This is particularly the case in respect of banks that operate across national borders.</p><p>Later this evening we will be debating the subject of motor insurance.  One startling event in recent years was the sudden collapse of Setanta Insurance.  It was operating in the Irish market but was regulated out of Malta for prudential purposes.  Clearly this regulatory model failed as, over two years later, customers of the bank are still left waiting for claims to be settled.  The question must be asked: is the system of banking regulation sufficiently strong in each country in the EU to prevent another Setanta-like situation arising?  While the largest banks across the EU are subject to centralised supervision by the ECB, this function is essentially subcontracted to national central banks in the case of smaller financial institutions.  It is highly likely that some depositors with amounts greater than &euro;100,000 are not aware that some of their savings may be at risk in the event of a future banking collapse.  It is important that people be aware of that risk and that they also be aware of the steps that are being taken and are in place to prevent such an occurrence.</p><p>The European banking system has not been cleaned up.  There are plenty of weak lenders across the Continent.  The biggest difference now is that, in contrast to 2010, inflation is at negligible levels.  The European Central Bank has missed its inflation target for four years and is very likely to miss it for some years to come.  This means that the banking system cannot rely on inflating away its problems.  While a sticking plaster has been applied by the ECB to the banking sector in the form of wave after wave of cheap money, a number of European banks remain in a fundamentally weak position.  The best mechanism to improve the health of the banks in the medium term is to improve the health of the economy in which they operate.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, renewed economic growth has underpinned the position of the banks.  A number of banks have released reserves as previous provisions in respect of bad debts now appear to have been overly pessimistic.  However, the same cannot be said for other European states.  Italy, Belgium and Spain all continue to have issues in their banking sector.  This is inextricably linked to the weakness of the overall European economy.</p><p>While Mario Draghi has been creative in terms of the monetary policy actions he has taken, the response of the European Commission in relation to fiscal policy has been woefully lacking.  Despite what the populists and anti-Europeans say, Europe itself is not the core problem.  However, the European Commission is not playing anywhere near the role it should in providing solutions.  The EU budget is limited because of the demands of anti-EU parties, so its ability to transfer money to hard-hit regions is contracting rather than expanding with need.  It is also failing to push countries that have the opportunity to spend more to stimulate the economy.  Should our neighbours in the UK vote later this month to leave the EU, there will be an immediate economic crisis and Ireland will be in the eye of the storm.  There are few, if any, monetary policy levers left to stave off a Europe-wide slump.  A sustained fiscal response is needed to stimulate the European economy.  In simple terms, this would mean Germany spending a bit more and paying themselves a bit more, which would have a positive spillover effect on all countries in the EU and would certainly stabilise the volatile political situation across the Union.</p><p>This month marks the fourth anniversary of the so-called game-changer deal on bank debt.  It might be worth recalling a few things that were said at the time.  The Taoiseach told us:</p><blockquote>To those the naysayers who say you should be beating the Lambeg drum up and down the streets of Europe, there is another way of getting results and that's what interests me.  I'm a hard grafter and, as some of them found out, they shouldn't tangle with me too often.</blockquote><p>Indeed, the Minister for Finance told the <i>Financial Times:</i></p><blockquote>Our negotiating position up to now was to put arrangements in place to lessen the burden of bank debts, but it would still remain on the sovereign balance sheet.  This agreement takes this further in terms of policy and the intention now is to separate certain bank debt completely from the sovereign balance sheet.</blockquote><p>It is not acceptable that the Government has all but given up on securing the implementation of the June 2012 EU summit agreement.</p><p>That summit agreement was interpreted by the Government as a game-changer which would deliver a bank-debt deal for Ireland.  No such deal has been secured in the intervening period. </p> <p> The early repayment of the IMF loans and changes to the terms of the EFSF and EFSM loans was fully supported by Fianna F&aacute;il but it is entirely separate to, and certainly not a substitute for, a deal on legacy bank debt.  Having failed to deliver a deal on bank debt, the Government switched to suggesting the sale of AIB shares as a better alternative.  This is completely contrary to what the Government has been saying all along, when a bank debt deal was the main objective.</p> <p> As I have said before, if the European Heads of State are to be true to their word, they would facilitate a retrospective recapitalisation of the banks.  It would be an acknowledgement that Ireland has not just a practical case for relief on the bank debt, but also a moral case, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, that the European position was imposed on Ireland.</p> <p> A final point I would make relates to the long-term bonds associated with the IBRC debt now held by the Central Bank.  At present, the interest payments on these bonds end up coming back to the Exchequer so the arrangement is effectively costless.  The Central Bank dividend of &euro;1.7 billion to the State is now hugely significant to the public finances and is largely driven by that transaction.  The pace at which the bonds being held by the Central Bank as a result of the promissory note deal are being sold is far greater than was originally agreed.  This means that instead of the annual interest payment on these bonds coming back to the State via the Central Bank surplus, they are being paid to a third party.  I believe a political case must be put to the ECB for considerably slowing the rate of sale, with the aim of the bonds being held to maturity.  This has the potential for improving the State finances in the years ahead.</p> <p> We look forward to the remainder of the debate on this Bill and to Committee Stage, and I reiterate Fianna F&aacute;il's support for the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I hope he has a successful and productive term of office.  For my part, I am very pleased to be appointed my party's spokesperson on European affairs.  It is a challenging brief, but it is an area that I have always taken a keen interest in, having been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs almost for its entire duration.  I think Deputy Durkan is aware of that fact.  I am also a long-standing member of the Institute of International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  I am committed to the ideals of the European Union.  It has promoted peace, stability, democracy and prosperity for many years and I do not think that should be under-estimated.  The European Union is facing a number of crises at this time.  In particular, I think of the migration crisis and the possibility of a Brexit and I have no doubt that we will have many debates about those issues in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us is quite technical, but it is great to have legislation finally coming before the D&aacute;il after the many weeks of the general election and Government formation.  This evening, we debate the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill 2016.  European Finance Ministers have agreed that member states participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism would develop a system by which bridge-financing in the form of national credit lines would be available as a last resort for the Single Resolution Fund in the event of a large resolution before the full size of the fund is reached.  Essentially what we are doing here this evening is fulfilling the necessary requirements to advance the banking union agenda.  Given the chaos European banks experienced since 2008, I am sure there is broad agreement that banking union is a good thing. </p>  <p>  The European Finance Ministers agreed in December that this should ideally be done by 1 January 2016.  It is a bit of a clich&eacute; but in this case, therefore, I really do hope that this Bill has a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Minister of State stressed the urgency of it in his contribution. </p>  <p>  As we debate the Bill, we should also reflect on the position of Ireland's banks since the 2008-11 crisis.  Ireland was one of the first states to experience potential bank collapse and it would be fair to say we felt very much isolated at the time.  As we know, shareholders and junior bondholders experienced losses but, largely at the insistence of the ECB at the time, senior bondholders and uninsured depositors were relatively untouched.  It should be remembered that the collapse of the banking sector in Ireland cost the Irish taxpayer &euro;64 billion.  Since then, the bank recovery and resolution direction has been agreed and is being implemented.  As a result, taxpayers will no longer automatically safeguard senior bonds by big deposits made by large companies.  This is a welcome development and is supported, I have no doubt, by the majority of the citizens of this State and the European Union.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we need clarification from the Minister of State on the position of Ireland at this point in time.  It would seem that the EU deal agreed in 2012 has not done anything for Ireland.  As stated by Deputy Michael McGrath, Fianna F&aacute;il believes strongly that we still need a deal on our bank debt.  Our Government should still actively campaign for a retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.  The June 2012 euro area summit statement pledges to "examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme".  It is my understanding that no such examination of Ireland's situation has taken place since then.  We, therefore, need a clear and unambiguous statement from the Minister for Finance as to the exact position at this stage in this regard.  </p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, banking union is vital if we are to avoid the mistakes of the past.  I welcome the commitment to initiate efforts to foster further cross-border consolidation within the euro area.  The aim should be to have large banks that are efficient and function and diversify risks on a cross-border basis within a European Single Market.  The Minister of State, when concluding, might update the House on the position of the Irish financial institutions in this context.  </p>  <p>  It should be stressed that Irish banks are currently well capitalised and in good health.  On this occasion, we can really believe this assurance.  Therefore, it is very unlikely that this loan facility will ever be called on.  I have no doubt that the legislation is in the interests of the citizens of this State, the eurozone area and the entire EU.  I also note that the fund will ultimately be financed by a levy on all euro area banks, something with which I think most people would agree.  I welcome the Bill.  It is in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, and I wish it a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-06-08a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800031#DD00300"><p>I also join my colleagues in congratulating Deputy Eoghan Murphy in his role as a Minister of State.  I wish him the very best in the time ahead.  This Bill is designed to address an international obligation arising from the banking union's agenda.  European Finance Ministers agreed that member states participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism should put in place a system by which bridge-financing in the form of national credit lines would be available as a last resort for the Single Resolution Fund in the event of a large resolution.  Most member states have either already put this in place or are about to do so, as there was a commitment following the European Finance Ministers agreement on the approach last December that this is needed to be in place by January 2016.</p><p>It is crucial, therefore, that we progress this Bill as quickly as possible to enable Ireland to meet its banking union commitments.</p> <p> The primary purpose of the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill 2016 is to give full effect to the State's obligations under the intergovernmental agreement on the single transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the single resolution board and to enable Ireland to proceed to ratify the intergovernmental agreement, IGA.  The single resolution board is part of the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM, which also comprises the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM.  The SRM was established to centralise resolutions responsible at EU level for large financial institutions within the euro area.  Ultimately, the SRM is aimed at ensuring the orderly resolution of failing banks without resort to taxpayers' money.  The Single Resolution Fund is a common bank resolution fund which supports this resolution.  The board is a pan-European resolution authority responsible for managing the wind-down and restructure of failing credit institutions and, as such, managing the fund.  All credit institutions, regardless of type, are required to contribute to the national compartment of the fund.  The board is responsible for significant credit institutions that are directly supervised under the SSM or the European Central Bank.  In Ireland's case, the banks concerned are Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.  In practise, this mean that if a bank is placed in resolution there is a clear process to be followed before funds can be drawn from the loan agreement between the State and the single resolution board.  A minimum of 8% of eligible liabilities must be written down in the bailing process before the Single Resolution Fund can be used.  The single resolution board could find itself in a situation, particularly in the early years, whereby following completion of a bailing process there are losses that remain to be absorbed.</p> <p> It is important to point out that, as my colleague stated earlier, the Irish banks are currently well capitalised and are generally in good health.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance is of the view that the likelihood of this loan facility agreement ever being called upon is minimal.  However, the provision of this national back-stop to the single resolution board is key from a confidence perspective as it provides another indication to the market that the banking union member states are serious about ensuring stability in the banking sector going forward.</p> <p> This legislation will enable the State to provide to the board a bridging finance agreement.  This will take the form of a national credit line of up to &euro;1.815 billion to the Single Resolution Fund.  During the initial build-up phase the fund will be composed of national compartments which were set up under the banking recovery and resolution directive and the Single Rulebook for the European credit institutions.  These compartments will be subject to gradual merger over eight years so that they will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period in 2024.  Compartments of the funds will be held by the participating member states which will make moneys available, as a last resort, to the board should the resolution mechanism be called upon.  Responsibility for placing credit institutions into the resolution procedure lies with the board.  During the eight-year transitional phase a common back-stop will be developed to facilitate borrowing by the fund and these will be ultimately reimbursed by contributions from the banking sector.</p> <p> As detailed, the credit lines extended to the participating member states will ultimately be accompanied by contributions from all European credit institutions.  During the recent crisis the Government and taxpayers provided support to failing banks.  In the absence of an appropriate resolution to underline the importance of establishing a common EU resolution framework to address failure in a timely and orderly manner, as a resolution authority, the Central Bank will be now in a position to have an input into resolution matters, domestically and at European level, in terms of participation in the single resolution board.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go maith leis, go n-&eacute;ireoidh go maith linn, agus go mbeidh comhoibri&uacute; eadrainn i rith an t&eacute;arma seo.  Mar an gc&eacute;anna leis an Teachta Michael McGrath, chuir m&eacute; aithne ar an Aire St&aacute;it le linn an fiosr&uacute;ch&aacute;n bainc&eacute;ireachta.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeimid in ann an caidreamh sin a choinne&aacute;il agus muid ar thaobhanna difri&uacute;la de na bins&iacute; anseo.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Unlike previous speakers I do not look forward to the speedy enactment of this legislation.  If anything, we should take time to consider and tease out all of what is included in banking legislation, including in this case, the loan facility agreement provided for therein and the unintended consequences or intended consequences or ramifications of different sections of that agreement.  I was hit by a bout of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>and was going to run for cover when I heard three Fianna F&aacute;il speakers in a row say that our banks are well capitalised.  It must be borne in mind that what we are speaking about in the context of this legislation is a &euro;1.8 billion loan facility.  We are told we will get back this money because it is unlikely we will ever have to issue the loan because our banks are so well capitalised.  In other words, the banks will pay us back.  We have heard all of that, or at least a version of it, before.  </p><p>There have been positive changes in this area, which I welcome.  However, it is key that we take our time with this legislation.  I understand that in terms of this matter we are already five months delayed but let us not be in such a rush that we do not parse the small number of paragraphs in this legislation or the more complex document adjoining it, which I will deal with later.  This legislation is the latest in a string of highly complex legislation in respect of implementation of the banking union.  Specifically, it ratifies an agreement whereby the State can loan more than &euro;1.8 billion to the single resolution board in the event of an Irish bank going bust.  We are told this is a temporary arrangement during the period up to 2024 while the board is being mutualised.  During this period, each member state has a compartment which can be called upon if one of its banks is in need and the fund is depleted.  If it is called upon it is to be repaid by the board over time from contributions from the banking sector.  We are told it is highly unlikely this scenario will ever arise.  Nevertheless many previously highly unlikely scenarios have occurred in the past few years.  I am sure if we were to travel back to this House ten years ago it would have been considered highly unlikely that we would at this time be living in a eurozone of zero inflation and zero bond rates.  It would have been considered highly unlikely that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB would be in part or full ownership of the State, yet here we are.  It is almost eight years since the bank guarantee was introduced and here we are again pledging the State's money to guarantee a failing bank if it is in trouble under certain circumstances.  It is a hypothetical and, according to the Minister, a highly unlikely scenario yet we are being asked to support it formally in legislation.  </p><p>It is important to consider what we are being asked to support today.  Section 3 states, &quot;Subject to the terms of the Loan Facility Agreement and the approval of the Minister, there may be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce of that Fund such sums, not exceeding, in aggregate, a sum of &euro;1,815,000,000, as are required to enable the State to make, to the Single Resolution Board, payments provided for in the foregoing agreement.&quot;  Where is the Oireachtas approval in all of this?  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will say that the Oireachtas approval is in this legislation in respect of which Fianna F&aacute;il is seeking a speedy passage through the House.  This legislation deals with expenditure or a loan of &euro;1.185 billion.  Surely, the Minister should be required to come back to the House to seek approval for individual tranches of loans.  At the stroke of a pen, without debate or a vote, we are being asked to empower a Minister, including a Minister without majority support, to hand over &euro;1.8 billion of the people's money at some time in the future.  Under section 6 the Minister is required to tell us at the end of the year how much of our money he or she has pledged in this loan.</p><p>That does not sit comfortably with me and it should not sit comfortably with anybody here.  We all know from bitter experience how an initial loan can get out of control and be extended and increased.  I want to examine this on Committee Stage in great detail.  I accept that section 3 deals with the sum not exceeding &euro;1.815 billion but section 2 states:</p><blockquote><b>Minister may perform functions for purposes of Loan Facility Agreement</b><br /><br /><b>2.</b>All such things as are necessary or expedient to be done for the purposes of the State&rsquo;s performing its functions under the Loan Facility Agreement may be done by the Minister and there is conferred, by virtue of this section, on the Minister all the powers necessary in that behalf.</blockquote><p>That is a very powerful section because we are basically empowering the Minister to do all the things the Minister needs to do to perform this function under the loan facility agreement.  On page 11 however, is stated: &quot;<b>'Fixed Individual Amount'</b>means on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, EUR 1,815,000,000, subject to any changes of such amount agreed in accordance with Clause 24 (Review Clause) of this Agreement.&quot;  Under Clause 24 everybody can agree at European level that the numbers should be higher.  We need to tease out how that sits with section 3 which puts a limit on the &euro;1.8 billion.  They are concerns I would like to see addressed on Committee Stage because under section 2 we are giving the Minister power to do whatever he needs to do, and all the powers under the sun to bring into being the agreement under the loan facility agreement, which includes on page 11 the idea that the sum of &euro;1.8 billion can be reviewed and Clause 24 allows for a review to happen which allows for the set amount to be increased.  I would be concerned that some legal loophole would be found in terms of section 3 that says section 2 allows him to do this and section 3 is not strong enough or robust enough.  That is why we need to take our time to tease out these issues and consider all the consequences of different sections, not only of the primary legislation but of the loan agreement which is named and party to this legislation.<br/><br/>Section 4 limits the potential calls on Ireland's compartment to institutions authorised in the State but by the latest count there are 477 institutions enjoying some sort of operation in the State.  Even on the list of licensed banks there are many the ordinary citizen would never have heard of on the high street or in radio advertising.  I would welcome clarity on how strict this potential call really is.<br/><br/>The banking union was built on a promise to separate sovereign and banking debt but it is questionable whether it has achieved this task.  The debate on banking union offered this State and the EU an opportunity to make sure a sovereign state would never be dragged down by a bank or system of banks again.  That was the big idea but, as often happens in the EU, the lobbying began.  Bigger countries flexed their muscles and suddenly the talk was about national compartments and sovereign backstops.  As usual, the EU institutions did not waste the crisis and the ECB has increased its power significantly while its accountability and transparency remain minimal at best.  If the banking union had achieved its aim of separating banking and sovereign debt, we would not be here today being asked to vote on a guarantee of &euro;1.85 billion for Irish banks that might fall into trouble.  There are positive elements of the banking union and I hope we will progress to the genuine separation of sovereign and banking debt but I have serious reservations.  The new rules do something that should always have been the case.  Bondholders now as a rule get burnt, then other steps are taken and only then is the state liable for any sort of hit.  It took some people here and in the EU hierarchy time to grasp the concept that has always been obvious to my party, that the speculators must lose when their bets do not come in.<br/><br/>The second opportunity offered by the banking union debate and the general debate around this crisis was one unique to this State.  The banking union discussions and the related European single mechanism talks offered a huge chance for this State to get some sort of justice on our debts.  We are told we have a new system whereby never again will a state have to bail out a bank, or at least in a few years we will have that type of system.  We are also told that a major Irish diplomatic breakthrough was achieved in this process, allowing us to apply the new rules retrospectively in order that we can get the money back that under the new rules would never have gone into these banks in the first place.  All we had to do was apply but the previous Government and, sadly, this one too have set their faces to ignoring this possibility and letting the people pay this debt.  When the history of these years is written, it will be said how bizarre it was that a small country that bore the brunt of the disastrous decisions chose not to use the mechanism that was set up specifically for it to apply for retrospective recapitalisation of its banks.  It is unbelievable that the Government will not even make an application.  Where is the bold Deputy Shane Ross who so decried the previous Government for not making such an application?  Where is he banging his fists now on the table and saying that the Government needs to do the right thing by the people?  Where is the new politics?  I welcome that Fianna F&aacute;il has said this should happen.  Of course it should happen.  It got us into this mess in the first place.  Its Ministers signed the promissory note cheques.  Its Government led us down this path.<br/><br/>Let us see if we can use this legislation to try to force the Government to make this application at long last.  This was our open goal during the whole banking union process, our chance to set some things right, and the Government turned round and ran back down the pitch.  The two great opportunities of banking union have gone a begging, or at least not yet been realised.  We are left with some better rules that we hope will work even though they have been diluted and we are also left with a banking debt that was not the people&rsquo;s debt and with banks that are still ripping us off even though we own some of them.  Banking union so far has not served the Irish people as well as it could have.  Nevertheless, it is a process under way and we must work to make sure it serves the interests of people and not just the interests of the banks or the ECB.  It is a major step to guaranteeing that in future bondholders, not people on social welfare or hospital trolleys, get burnt.<br/><br/>I will scrutinise this legislation on Committee Stage and will take my time doing so.  I will consider amendments to the section based on the concerns that I have raised and I will deal with them.  If the majority in the House believes this minority Government should make a retroactive recapitalisation, perhaps we will enter a clause in the legislation to make that happen.</p></speech>

It has been a very slow process.  In respect of what the previous speaker said about the European Union and its response to the banking crisis, it was very disappointing.  I have said that before.  The EU&rsquo;s initial response to the financial crisis was too slow, dictated from the centre and ideologically blinkered in approach.</p><p>As a Minister, from 2011, I repeatedly argued, together with my colleagues in the Labour Party, that the EU needed to shift from austerity towards a policy based on investment growth and job creation, with full employment as the central target, and to have a significant capital investment programme.  In a certain sense, the flaw in the Bill is what is not present in terms of a comprehensive response to the financial crisis by the European Union.  The response is very technical and narrow and is focused on the banking sector.  As the Minister of State said, the Bill is technical in nature.</p> <p> I will focus on Ireland rather than other countries.  I refer to Professor John FitzGerald and a recent ESRI study.  It found that during the economic crisis the main features of the Irish welfare system were preserved and welfare spending was largely protected from the huge reining in of public spending.  Professor FitzGerald said a limited cut in nominal rates for most payments, which took place during the term of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government, was offset by a fall in prices, leading to a small increase in the purchasing power of benefits.  As Minister, I ensured that pensioners were largely exempt from the cuts, and as a result the real value of the State pension increased when incomes were generally falling.</p> <p> Ireland's market incomes, as we know, are very unevenly distributed and the tax system and welfare system, in particular, play a very important role in redirecting income.  The welfare system protected us from a potential growth in inequality during the economic crisis.  ESRI studies found that after tax and welfare, there was no change in income inequality between 2007 and 2014.  We would have liked if income inequality could have been reduced further.  I see Members in the Chamber who rushed over to be supporters of a particular Greek model which toyed with default.  As the appreciation of what a default actually meant for ordinary people and businesses in a country developed, they drew back from that.  The EU could have dealt with Greece and a number of other countries in a much better way.</p> <p> The other remarkable feature of the Irish history of the collapse of the banking system is that there were no forced redundancies in the public service.  Many people took early retirement on an agreed basis and left the service, which diminished resources in a number of areas.  Some Deputies have professed long and intense admiration here and in other Chambers for other approaches but were unfortunately not able to succeed in achieving them, although I am sure that was their aim.</p> <p> The problem with the structures the EU has put in place regarding banking is that while it has addressed banking structures, the ECB does not have a remit for critical areas for the well-being of European societies, such as a policy on full employment or young people obtaining employment, apprenticeships and traineeships.  I refer to those countries which are still experiencing both little or no economic growth and major unemployment.  In 2011 when the Labour Party went into government, unemployment was over 15%, and when it left office, it had fallen to 7.8%.  Youth unemployment had more than halved, although it is still too high.</p> <p> When it was in government, the Labour Party had a single-minded focus on getting people back to work.  Recent figures show that the number of people in schemes has fallen substantially because young people coming out of college are getting jobs and recruiters are back in all the colleges and universities.  We have also restarted apprenticeships.  Much more needs to be done to get more young people the apprenticeships and training that will help them to get good, well-paid employment and careers.</p> <p> I am disappointed with the Bill in terms of the EU structures involved.  The Minister of State is simply presenting this element of the EU structure.  I do not believe a strong enough case has been made for the structures to be accompanied by policies around investment, capital investment and full employment.</p> <p> The debate on Brexit is taking place in the North and our neighbouring island.  There are probably people in the Chamber who favour Brexit.  However, the context of Brexit should be remembered.  We need to understand why people feel alienated from European institutions which have brought an end to war on the Continent and were constructed in the context of the horrendous Second World War.  As a result of the failure of the EU to focus on investment and full employment, it no longer commands the kind of political support which it was able to ten, 15 or 20 years ago across Europe.  There is an intense debate in Britain about whether to leave or remain.  Other countries in Europe are now engaging in that type of debate.</p> <p> When we approach structural legislation, we have to do so in the context of considering how it addresses the serious problems that befell people throughout Europe as a consequence of the events of 2008 and subsequent years.  As I said, I was appalled by the lack of an investment and growth programme from the EU.  I still think the Juncker proposals are not of significant benefit to Ireland because we do not have the kind of large-scale private companies that could carry the type of investment they propose.   What is missing is a vehicle from which to have investment in public projects.</p> <p> A number of very large public projects are now required in Ireland, and there have been many discussions in the Chamber on the subject.  The programme for Government refers to investment in broadband as a way of developing more small and medium businesses in Ireland.  The area which requires rapid investment and the scaling-up of investment is housing and the construction of homes and apartments.</p> <p> The Minister of State said the banks in Ireland are doing very well.  I understand the phrase he used in his speech was that the banks are "well capitalised".  A well-capitalised bank may not be a bank that is functioning well if it is not lending in an accessible way for the construction of homes, as is required by our society.</p><p>We have a significant expansion in the population.  We have a flow of returning emigrants and inward migration, which is being utilised in our expanding economy, but because the banks are not functioning, particularly for medium-sized developers and builders, we are not getting anything like the housing construction we require.</p> <p> I do not agree with the Minister of State's comment in the context of housing, "It is important to point out that our banks are currently well capitalised [that is true] and in general good health."  However, a bank that is not able to lend to developers for a vital economic and social need such as housing on a small and medium scale is not contributing what it should to a functioning economy.  I say to the Department of Finance that the statement to which I referred is not adequate because if a developer intends to build a block of apartments in the city centre, he must have all the capital lined up and in place to build all of the apartments.  One cannot, for example, get funding for the first five of a total of 40 apartments and then go back and look for the funding for the next five.  All the funding must be in place at the start.</p> <p> It is easier to get funding for individual house building, for which there is considerable demand, in particular in suburban Dublin and in the suburbs of other cities.  People want a family home in which they can raise their children.  However, there is again a problem with banks in terms of financing builders and developers, in particular medium-sized and larger developers.  NAMA has been funding some developers but the banks in general are not doing so as yet.  We still do not have the kind of flow of development from the strategic investment fund that ought to be in place by now.  I understand a review of the fund is under way but it is not producing the strategic flow of capital to build the houses and apartments we need in this country.</p> <p> Let us be clear that the purpose of banks is to mind people&rsquo;s deposits and to lend that money.  We know that banks are very shy of lending.  According to the most recent statistics, development and building, which should account for approximately 10% of economic activity in this country, is down to approximately 6% net.  That is grossly inadequate.  One cannot really commend the banks when they are not doing what they are meant to do in a normal economy, which is to aid the flow of money around the economy.</p> <p> The Single Resolution Fund is a technical mechanism to ensure bank collapses do not happen again, but bank collapse is not just a function of technical regulation.  It is a function of a functioning economy where people have jobs and they are not afraid to spend.  If there is large unemployment, as applies in a number of European Union countries &ndash; thankfully Ireland is moving away from that &ndash; people then become afraid to spend and, accordingly, one builds up a problem whereby activity in the economy is way below what the levels need to be.  There have been right-wing ideological views in Europe to the effect that this is the way the structures ought to be, but to some extent that is standing economics on its head.  One needs activity and people at work and then one is a position to provide the social goods and capital investments such as houses that people need.  The banks are a key element in facilitating that.  The banks are not in rude health if that is not happening.  When the Minister of State responds at the end of the debate, I ask him to comment on that point.  The issue does not feature directly in the Bill before the House but it is crucial to the future of Europe and the economic future of this State in order that we can reduce unemployment further and get a job with good pay and conditions for everybody in this country who wants a job.  Given that as a country we have been investing a great deal in education, we have tremendous potential for sustainable economic growth with improvements in capital investment if we use the banking system properly.</p> <p> The regulation of the European banking structures has taken a very long time.  Much of the process was decided in 2012 and 2013 and the long gestation period of the Bill is one measure of how slow Europe has been, over a period when we experienced some of the worst crises seen in post-war Europe.  There was no feeling of urgency in dealing with the consequences of the banking crisis, which has been experienced in many countries, including high levels of unemployment in Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Portugal to a lesser extent.  There are high levels of unemployment among young graduates, young people and workers in general.  That is not a sign of a functioning European Union.  While the Bill is part of the mechanism of resolving and ameliorating future crises, it does not sufficiently address the after-effects.  I do not know whether the Minister has any counterpart proposals to accompany the legislation that would ensure the kind of investment and policy orientated to full employment and major infrastructural development, including the kind of development we need as a country in terms of climate change.</p> <p> In the context of the discussion in the United Kingdom on Brexit, does the Government have a view on an investment and employment programme?  The UK has very significant employment creation figures at the moment, but the terms and conditions of work in many areas of employment have worsened.  Notwithstanding the difficulties we have been through, thanks to the Labour Party being in government, we are the only country that has improved collective bargaining for workers during the recent incredibly difficult period in our financial history.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply in due course.</p></speech>

He said it was "a momentous day for banking union" and "a memorable day for Europe's financial sector".  I would say that was the case.  He also said he was "introducing revolutionary changes to Europe's financial sector ... so that taxpayers no longer foot the bill when banks make mistakes ... ending the era of massive bailouts".  That was the way banking union was announced.</p><p>It is a strange way to go about ending the era of massive bailouts when Members have legislation before them that is about facilitating the transfer of at least &euro;1.815 billion of public money from Ireland to a fund for bank bailouts.  Obviously, Members are told we will get the money back and are sort of promised this amount of money will not increase.  However, it perhaps illustrates that the banking union is not all it is cracked up to be.<br/><br/>On some level, one must be impressed by how the banks have managed to turn this crisis.  When the crisis emerged, people clearly identified the big banks in particular as a key part of the problem.  There were demands to break up the big banks, to separate out different functions of banking and, in particular, to end the process of bank bailouts.  Through a process of lobbying, and European banks have more than 1,000 lobbyists in Brussels and spend &euro;120 million per year on lobbying, they have managed to transform that narrative, having been helped significantly by the fact the European Commission is in their favour and the European Central Bank acts in their interests.  They have managed to transform completely the process for banking union into a process that is driving the further liberalisation of banking across Europe in the interests of achieving a single market in banking.  Effectively, it establishes a union in the interests of the banks, written partly by the big banks themselves.  It transfers even more power to the European Central Bank as the regulator of the banks, which is somewhat like putting the fox in charge of chickens.  Moreover, it does little to stop the possibility of further bank bailouts, paid for by public money.  For all these reasons, the Anti-Austerity Alliance opposes this legislation.  It will propose amendments on Committee Stage but will oppose it on Second Stage.<br/><br/>To start with the details, an important question has been raised about the amount being discussed in this Bill.  While it refers to an amount of &euro;1.815 billion, it then states this is subject to any changes made in accordance with Clause 24, the review clause, which clearly appears to suggest that figure can be increased.  I will be interested in the response of the Minister of State to this point.  The other point I wish to make in opening is that Members should remember where this came from.  The origins of this Bill can be dated back to that infamous summit of June 2012 at which two clear commitments were made.  The first was that it was imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, with which this Bill is meant to be dealing.  The other commitment made was &quot;to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further enhancing the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&quot;.  That, translated into the language of Irish politics through the mouths of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and Eamon Gilmore, became a game-changer, a seismic shift and a promise that retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banks could and would take place and that we would get back some of the 42% of the total cost of the crisis to the European banking system that we took on.  Moreover, the media in general bought it with very few exceptions.  Not only has this not happened and will not happen, the Government even tried to state this somehow is a success and to claim it is a victory that Ireland is not obliged to seek that money back, that massive bank bailout for which people in this country are still paying.<br/><br/>As for banking union itself, a key point is that it will not work.  It does not break up or do anything to break up the big banks.  While the big banks are covered by the fund, all the small banks, which encompass a quite significant portion of the European banking sector, are not.  Most significantly, the fund simply is not big enough.  A very good article by Wolfgang Munchau was published in the <i>Financial Times </i>a couple of years ago.  While some of the details have changed since, it essentially gets to the point, which is that the aggregate balance of the European financial sector, excluding the central banks, is more than &euro;33 trillion.  He wrote:</p><blockquote>The bank resolution fund for this new banking union will be built up over 10 years [that is now eight years] ... At the end of that period it will have reached &euro;55bn &ndash; a mere 0.2 per cent of the asset base.  Most of these banks have assets of more than &euro;30bn.  In a systemic crisis, in which banks can suddenly collapse, the whole European resolution fund could easily be swallowed by a single moderately sized bank.</blockquote><p>In those circumstances, it then fundamentally will be back onto member states and public money through the European Stability Mechanism.  Consequently, bailouts have not gone away.  The scale of a possible banking crisis, particularly if one considers events in China and so on as well as the weaknesses of the European banking system, means we could be back to the question of bank bailouts.<br/><br/>My second point pertains to the undemocratic way in which this has happened.  The model of the intergovernmental agreement is a bad precedent to set.  It means evading the limited checks that exist, for example, through the European Parliament such that the manner in which this is being processed is extremely undemocratic even by European Union standards.  Most important, however, this gives even more power to what arguably is the most powerful undemocratic and unelected institution in the entire world, which is the European Central Bank.  The European Central Bank is being put in place as the regulator of the banks in the knowledge that this is the same institution that in 2011 intervened actively to remove elected governments - whatever one might think about them - in Greece and Italy and to replace them with governments pretty much explicitly of bankers for bankers with a mandate to deliver for the banks and to deliver the maximum amount of money back to the banks.  This is the institution that has been put in charge of regulating the financial system, which is extremely problematic.<br/><br/>Another point I will make is this plays a useful role from the perspective of the banks of shaping a narrative about the crisis that longer is about the banks or about the nature of the banking system.  Instead, it becomes a technical question about supervision and who supervises them.  It does not deal with any of the fundamental problems and the point is that if one wishes to avoid massive banking crises in the future and the implication of significant bailouts of public money, one then must break up the big banks.  For example, it is estimated that Deutsche Bank is made up of approximately 2,000 entities and on the scale of some of the massive megabanks in the United States.  There are other megabanks within Europe that are immensely politically and economically powerful and they must be broken up.<br/><br/>In addition, fundamentally we need a different sort of banking system.  It has been exposed clearly in recent years that societies have been run in the interests of profit maximisation of the banks.  This fundamentally is a problem and it is necessary to rethink and reimagine what banks are for.  Banks must be in public ownership and must be run as democratic public utilities to provide for society, that is, to facilitate society and the economy as a whole in respect of ordinary people having jobs, creating wealth and getting access to credit.  While that is what banks should be, unfortunately it is the opposite of what banks are at present, namely, functioning as a parasite on the economy as a whole and on society at large.  Unfortunately, the banking union and this Bill, which entails Ireland giving &euro;1.8 billion, does nothing to resolve the situation regarding the banking system.  It enables the banks to pretend that something significant has happened.  It has not and the situation continues as it has been.  The European Union functions in the interests of the banking system, unfortunately, and there are no proposals here fundamentally to change this.  Public money will still be used to bail out private banks with the European Central Bank having been further empowered.</p></speech>
