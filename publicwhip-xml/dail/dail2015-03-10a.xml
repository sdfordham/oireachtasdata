Along the way, the Taoiseach mentioned that he was interested in seeing specialised or "cast-iron" guarantees in relation to the sale around issues such as employment and connectivity.  Could the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outline also the nature and character of the assurances that were sought as part of those discussions with IAG?</p></reply>

However, I did make a detailed statement clarifying the Government's position on the matter last month.</p>  <p>  While acknowledging the details and clarifications which both IAG and Aer Lingus have offered since IAG announced its initial proposal to acquire Aer Lingus, it is the Government's view that the IAG proposal does not at present provide a basis on which we could provide an irrevocable commitment to accept an offer.  Further consideration of any IAG proposals will be based on having greater clarity from IAG on the overall employment prospects on the basis of the proposals received, with particular reference to the timeframe within which net additional employment would be created; firm commitments on plans for growing Aer Lingus' transatlantic business; and plans to grow Aer Lingus' routes at Cork and Shannon and to enhance the Knock-Gatwick service.  The Government also requires a longer period on the commitments related to Heathrow.  The nature and acceptability of oversight mechanisms on the Heathrow slots and routes needs to be confirmed.  These would also be subject to any EU considerations.</p>  <p>  As I stated last week, the Government, in line with stated policy, remains open to considering any improved proposal.  On Wednesday last, the Government's interdepartmental steering group held a further meeting with representatives from the consolidated International Airlines Group at its request.  Further meetings are expected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000004#B00100"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply although he has not added anything to our knowledge.  While I understand the issues around takeover rules, it would be possible for the Minister to outline to the House the kind of assurances he has sought.  I understand he was seeking assurances on particular areas but I am interested in the nature and detail of those assurances.  I am concerned that in the context of any contract that the Minister might enter into based on assurances given by IAG, the only remedy in the event of a breach by IAG of those assurances would be sought through the courts.  As I have said before, the likely outcome of such proceedings if a breach was found to have happened would be that State might receive some financial compensation.  While that might benefit the State in some way, the loss of access to Heathrow for locations like Shannon and Cork could not be compensated for financially.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that it would be open to the courts to insist on the retention or recovery of access to Heathrow.  That is why it is extremely important for the Minister to put before the House the nature of the assurances sought and the mechanism he intends to put in place to deal with the fallout in the event of there being a breach of such assurances and a failure to comply with any contractual arrangements that might be entered into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000004#B00200"><p>It is now very much a matter for IAG as to whether it wishes to make a further proposal which we would then consider in the way I have outlined.  In response to the Deputy's specific question about the nature of assurances, we have not received any further assurances beyond the proposed deal that IAG made available a number of weeks ago which I have said was not acceptable to the Government and which did not provide the basis upon which I could give an irrevocable commitment to sell our share in Aer Lingus.  Regarding the Deputy's point on access, we have always made clear that in evaluating any proposed bid we would look beyond the price of a share, important as that is and I have always specifically referenced access as being vital in our considerations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000004#B00300"><p>I appreciate that the Minister recognises the importance of access but I contend that if he really believed in its extreme importance, he would have to question whether the State should even be negotiating with IAG about the sale of the State's share holding.  My contention is that once we sell the State's share holding, our capacity to influence the retention of access to Heathrow from Shannon and Cork is diminished absolutely.  In other words, any assurances backed up by letters of warranty or any contractual arrangements that might be entered into have no long-term capacity to be maintained.  The State will have no power to maintain those links.  At best, in the event of a breach of contract, the State will get some financial compensation which in no way has the capacity to meet the needs and demands of the locations and jobs which are supported by access to Heathrow.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the power that our shareholding confers on us at the moment is the ability to play a role in blocking the disposal of slots at Heathrow but not in determining their use.  I must emphasise again that maintaining and growing access for our country, with particular focus on what will happen at airports such as Cork and Shannon, is core to how the Government and I will evaluate this proposal.</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority, NTA, has responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services, including the provision of PSO subvented services.  I ensured that PSO funding was maintained at current levels in the last budget, the first time this has happened since 2008.  I was also able to secure an additional &euro;101 million in funding for our public transport companies in a Supplementary Estimate,</p><p>Expressway services are commercial services operated in competition with private operators on main trunk routes and are licensed by the NTA.  These commercial services do not receive any PSO funding from the Exchequer.  I am acutely aware of the concerns of many people regarding recent decisions to withdraw services to a number of intermediate locations on major routes into Dublin.  Major improvements to the national roads network have provided the opportunity for commercial bus operators to offer improved journey times between Dublin and the regional cities in particular with the consequent effect of reducing the level of service provided to a number of intermediate locations.</p><p>There are two routes - not hundreds, as reported in the media - that are currently at issue.  These are routes 5 and 7.  At a recent community meeting in Castlecomer, Bus &Eacute;ireann agreed to postpone the changes to its licensed route 7 services until June.  A working group comprising local representatives and members of the local community is now in place to respond to this issue.  The NTA is examining what might be an appropriate PSO service to put in place subject to funding.</p><p>Separately, the NTA, in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann, is examining options to reconfigure existing PSO services in the south east in order to maintain socially necessary services to the affected areas following the withdrawal of route 5.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House  </i></p><p>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the NTA on wider issues around transport in rural Ireland over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann has withdrawn these services because there is no adequate commercial rationale to it delivering them.  In the absence of these services, changes will have to be made to existing subvented services.  The Deputy will be aware that subvented services are services funded by the taxpayer.  Another option is the putting in place of other services that would be delivered via the National Transport Authority, which will cost the State money to deliver.  The National Transport Authority is currently engaging on this issue.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's point about the impact of this on rural communities, I fully appreciate and understand that.  The approach of Sinn F&eacute;in is to continually make big, uncosted promises, as it is again doing in relation to rural transport.  Sinn F&eacute;in made many commitments at the weekend in relation to services which it proposes to maintain or deliver, including the filling of many potholes.  However, what it did not say is from where this money will come.  With the funding available to me, I am responding to the level of social need that I accept exists.</p></speech>

As I have previously said on a number of occasions, the IASS and its funding is a matter for the trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme member and the Pensions Authority.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the trustee proposal which was approved by the Pensions Authority and implemented on 31 December 2014 includes a contribution by Aer Lingus and DAA totalling more than &euro;260 million, which includes &euro;60 million for deferred members.  The IASS trustee has confirmed that the measures being implemented are in the overall best interest of the members of the IASS as a whole and are fully compliant with national and EU law.  Not to have taken the course of action that I did would have meant going against the explicit recommendations of those charged with managing the fund.  It would have taken the largest pension fund in the country into uncharted territory, with many risks, including the risk that the scheme would be wound up.</p> <p> With regard to the proposed sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus, I have consistently set out the Government&rsquo;s position on the issues that it would take account of in considering any offer for its shareholding in Aer Lingus.  In addition to price, the other issues that will be examined include connectivity to and from Ireland, including direct transatlantic services and connectivity via Heathrow, competition in the air transport market, jobs in Irish aviation and the Aer Lingus brand.</p> <p> The specific issue raised by the Deputy in the event of a sale is a matter for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the Deputy's suggestion raises two issues: first, how such an investment could be made without prompting further demands on a deal that has taken many years to negotiate; and second, the consequences of a direct investment by the taxpayer in a private pension fund when many other pension funds are in serious difficulties.</p></speech>

The question is specifically directed towards the placing of further demands on a deal that has taken many years to negotiate.  That is exactly what I am trying to do, because this deal is a dastardly deal that discriminates against people who are now in a hopeless situation.  I get no comfort from the Minister's reply.  It seems to me that these people have been abandoned by the Government in an absolutely shameless way because they have nothing to fight with.  The Minister said the trustee was acting in the overall interests of all the stakeholders.  What the trustee, and the Government in its Pontius Pilate-like attitude, are doing is creating an oppressed minority.  Here is a minority that cannot fight, that cannot withdraw its labour, and that is being discriminated against in a way that the Government would not dare to attempt with the active members of the scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to make representations to the Department of Finance in order that, when the Government gets the money, there is nowhere more appropriate for a small proportion of it to go than to treat these people with equality, justice and fairness.</p></speech>

I have met them and I have had much dealing on their behalf, but a challenge that must be faced is the request - a request made by Deputy Ross and many of the deferrees also - to go against a recommendation from a trustee of the fund who has statutory responsibility for its management.  This is a fund which reported a deficit of &euro;769 million on 27 March 2013.  The fund has received additional support from the employers involved totalling &euro;260 million - &euro;190 million from Aer Lingus and &euro;72 million from daa.  Included within that is &euro;60 million for deferred members, &euro;20 million of which is an increase due to engagement with the expert panel.  I would appreciate if the Deputy could clarify his position on the matter.  I understand that on 2 February 2015 Deputy Ross wrote in an article stating that the State should not sell its stake in Aer Lingus, yet he has now asked in the D&aacute;il Chamber that I sell the stake to deal with this matter.</p></speech>

That is a trivial point.  I am saying that in the event of Aer Lingus being sold the money should go to these people.</p><p>The Minister made an absurd point.  He is particularly compromised on this issue because it involves a large number of voters in his constituency.  This makes it very difficult for him to make objective judgments on a matter of this nature and will obviously influence his decision. </p> <p> The Minister should be aware that the companies in question have issued strident documents to the employees in which they are told to sign a waiver or see their pensions go up in smoke.  The employees are being asked to forego their legal right to sue or take action in future.  These letters are placing additional pressure on people to give up their legal rights.  The Minister is not being fair to these people who have been treated extraordinarily badly.  The money will be available.  The Minister should contradict the trustee - that is precisely what I am asking - and act in the just and fair interests of people who served the nation well.</p></speech>

He implied that he is completely insulated from any electoral concerns in respect of the issues that are being raised.  It is not ridiculous to point out that he has taken an inconsistent position in this matter when, on the one hand, he opposes the sale of Aer Lingus, while, on the other, he argues that the company should be sold to deal with the matter he raises in this question.</p></speech>

We are discussing a pension fund that has a deficit of more than &euro;760 million, and a further contribution of &euro;260 million has been made to address the issue we are discussing.  The Deputy did not acknowledge that point.  I fully understand the concern and worry that many people are experiencing.  The challenge facing me was that if I had taken any other course of action, I would have deepened this worry and caused greater concern for even more people.</p></speech>

I reiterate that public service obligation, PSO, funding to public transport companies has been maintained this year at 2014 levels.  This is the first time since 2008 that this funding has not been reduced.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that Bus &Eacute;ireann has not taken a decision to withdraw services on Expressway route 21 from Athlone to Westport.  The company informed me that it undertook a "Use it, don't lose it" public campaign in late 2014 in the area, with promotional fares and a media and marketing campaign to encourage people to use the service or face losing it.  These promotional fares are still in place and the company continues to review the service from a commercial perspective.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that Expressway services do not receive a public service obligation subvention.  They are required to operate on a commercial basis and may be subject to competition from other operators.</p></speech>

An issue is emerging in discussions with unions and people who have an interest in the provision of these services.  Concern has been expressed about the issuing of licences by the National Transport Authority.  There would appear to be a lack of appropriate co-ordination in balancing the needs of the rural community with the necessity for competition on inter-urban routes.  While I recognise fully the work the NTA does in ensuring a competitive environment exists on routes between large towns and what may be termed inter-urban routes, the associated effects, or, perhaps, the overemphasis on creating absolute competition on every service, has created a situation in which many services which had been profitable at certain times heretofore are no longer profitable.  This is putting Bus &Eacute;ireann in a difficult position.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to talk more generally about the approach towards the issuing of licences, the role of the NTA and the direction from Government in terms of a coherent policy position on the provision of appropriate bus services to rural areas.</p></speech>

One of the big drivers in all of this has been the fact that we have so many new and improved national routes.  There is a great demand from communities on those national routes to make use of services from point to point.  As a consequence, some communities are now facing either a significant reduction in a service or a complete loss of that service.</p>  <p>  I will set out a direct answer to the core question the Deputy has put to me regarding how this should be managed.  I am considering how we could develop it in future, but the way it is being done at the moment is that in the absence of a commercially feasible service we are looking at the alternatives that could be put in place and which would be affordable to the taxpayer to deal with the needs that I know rural and local communities have.  This work is ongoing and I expect that we will be in a position to be able to confirm how routes 5 and 7 will be dealt with.</p></speech>

I do not mean this in a Big Brother way, but perhaps in consultation with the NTA.  Will the Minister review the entire process of the issuing of licences to establish when and if there is effective competition?  I call on the Minister to look to the broader need of the catchment area to ensure that all areas are served adequately and appropriately.</p>  <p>  Let us consider a route between two large towns or one of the cities and a large town.  Not every service need go on the main route.  With proper structuring it should be possible to serve the direct requirement and the indirect requirement, perhaps without requiring a subvention.  None of us are suggesting that we simply need to find more money to subvent services.  Of course it should be provided if it is absolutely necessary, but I believe there is a more appropriate, balanced and structured way of achieving the same result.  It will require the input of the NTA as well as a little change in direction.  The competitive environment should be considered in a holistic way rather than simply in the point-to-point way it is being considered at the moment.</p></speech>

All of this is in the context of a bus market that is growing.  More passengers are using the services now than last year.  Buses and services have been made available.  The evidence of my commitment to the need to expand public transport in our country is the fact that, of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;110 million that I brought to the D&aacute;il before Christmas, a little over half went to public bus transport companies, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  I will give consideration to the point regarding the need to look at how licences are being granted to see if it is contributing at all to the challenge that we are facing.</p><p>I think it very unlikely in dealing with the services needed by villages and communities below a certain level, although I wish it were the case, that these can be provided without some support from the State.  The point is that if they could be supported and delivered in a viable manner, we would not be in the situation where these services are being withdrawn in the first place.</p> <p> We are working on a model to respond to the issues concerning routes 5 and 7 and we will look at how this broader matter can be dealt with.</p></speech>

However, as the Minister knows, in my part of the country - in western counties like Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Leitrim and Sligo - we have not seen the impact.

This was an extraordinary performance on their behalf, making it the best year ever for the number of travellers in and out of this airport.  This success should not be forgotten and is, in part, thanks to Exchequer support over the past ten years of over &euro;20 million in capital and operational subvention.</p>  <p>  My Department has had extensive engagement with the various representatives of Ireland West Airport Knock over the years and, in particular, was represented on and provided secretarial support to the Ireland West Airport Knock study group, which reported in December 2013 on the options and opportunities for the growth and development of the airport.  The outcomes of that study have been reflected in Ireland's draft national aviation policy.  They also underpin Ireland's draft regional airports programme 2015-19, which is with the European Commission at present for its consideration and approval.</p>  <p>  The most recent engagement with the airport, along with Donegal, Kerry and Waterford airports, has been in regard to the EU guidelines on state aid for airports and airlines, and clarifying issues raised with the Commission which, in turn, are being reflected in the new programme.  The Department is also engaging with the airports in preparation for implementation of that programme once we get the necessary EU approval, and also in regard to their future growth and funding under that programme.</p></speech>

I would contend that Knock Airport is not a regional airport.  It serves a catchment of 1.1 million people and supports 900 jobs within the region.  It is a significant economic driver and has the potential to bring more investment into the region.</p>  <p>  When was that proposal submitted to the European Commission and when is it likely we will see approval for it from the Commission?  What is the timeline for the implementation of the recommendations set out in that working group report by the airport and the Government back in December 2013?

The Minister is very familiar with my county.  Some 16% of passengers going through Knock Airport come from County Roscommon and 18% of the tourists that come through Knock Airport visit Roscommon, something which is replicated throughout the west.  Knock Airport is a strategically important international airport, just like Shannon, and needs to be treated in such a manner by the Government.  Can the Minister assure me that we will not have a situation like we had in March 2013, when a Finance Bill was brought before the House to deal with Shannon Airport?  Knock Airport should not be ignored.  On foot of that we had a report.  We now want to see it, and see the joint approach by Government and the airport implemented quickly.

Under the 2009 EU effort-sharing decision, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government advises that Ireland is on course to comply with annual emissions reduction targets for the compliance period of 2013 to 2016.   However, in respect of the remaining years to 2020, a significant compliance challenge has been highlighted by the EPA.</p>  <p>  There is an acute awareness of this challenge across sectors, not least by transport.   As the Deputy will be aware, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is currently progressing through the D&aacute;il.   It will create a statutory obligation to develop a national mitigation plan for Ireland which will seek to put in place the necessary mitigation measures to meet the long-term policy objectives of transitioning to a low carbon economy by 2050.   The first iteration of the plan will place particular focus on identifying those measures needed to address the challenges arising from the second half of the compliance period, that is, from 2017 to 2020.  My Department's contribution to the plan is currently being developed and, in keeping with commitments under the Aarhus Convention, my officials expect to invite stakeholders to a consultative workshop on the transport element of the plan in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  In terms of non-compliance costs, the comprehensive expenditure report 2015 to 2017 sets out three-year expenditure ceilings for each ministerial Vote group.</p><p>All spending decisions must be cognisant of these limits within the wider context of the new fiscal structures being put in place at a European level through reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact.  Mitigation is a cross-sectoral issue that will require a whole-of-government approach in tackling some very complex matters between now and 2020.</p></reply>

We must heed what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated: if the modelling scenarios are realised, the scale of investment, compliance costs and climate finance required to be funded by the Exchequer for the period from 2021 to 2030 could result in the displacement of other Government programmes.  Essentially, it has argued that we will have to make up from the Exchequer what we do not provide for in mitigating measures.</p>  <p>  The timeline for the DART underground sees a decision being forced in September of next year, after which the railway order will cease to be legal.  That would be a game-changer.  One of the difficulties is that the sectoral plans in the climate legislation that has been published and started its passage through the D&aacute;il will not come into effect for two years after the legislation is put in place.  We are making targets even more unrealistic by pushing this out into the future.  This is a real issue.</p></speech>

We are working with the European Commission and all our Departments to develop a plan to deliver our contribution to the objective set by the European Union for itself.  Within my Department, we will be required to draft the transport element of the national mitigation plan and submit it to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We will have the first draft of this work done in the coming weeks and I expect that the overall national mitigation plan will be published by the summer of 2017.</p></speech>

It is self-evident that if there is less transport because of the downturn, there may have been understatement of the normal position in a functioning economy.  It is welcome that there will be a publication in the next few weeks, as we have lost much time on this issue.  This leads to another question on the kind of fiscal expansion required into areas such as the delivery of really good public transport.  We will be very compromised when it comes to the sectoral plans, particularly with regard to agriculture, and some sectors will possibly have to do more than what would otherwise have been expected.  There may well be a role for the European Union or private funding in this area.</p></speech>

My comments on the transport element of the mitigation plan indicated that we would be submitting our contribution to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for consideration in the overall plan, which would be published in the summer of 2017.  That being said, I understand there will be a period of public consultation in the interim to consider what is proposed and the consequences for our economy, as well as allowing stakeholders to make their views known.</p><p>I am absolutely clear that public transport has a crucial role to play in alleviating the consequences of climate change.  That is why we are delivering Luas cross-city which we aim to have up and running by 2017 to deliver an additional 10 million journeys.  That is why we put more than &euro;100 million into CIE before Christmas to maintain existing public transport, and with the funding we will deliver new buses to the Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus fleets this year to meet the needs to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

I understand that, if the bid is successful, the IRFU proposes to host the tournament pool stages at University College Dublin, UCD, with the semi-finals and final in Belfast.  I am confident that Dublin would be a great host for the games, that the public would support the event and make it a very memorable world cup.   I wrote to the IRFU in recent weeks expressing my support and the full support of the Department and agencies.  Hosting the women&rsquo;s rugby world cup would provide a great opportunity to showcase the island of Ireland internationally. </p>  <p>  The programme for Government made a commitment that event tourism would be prioritised to continue to bring major events to Ireland.  This provides a great showcase for Ireland and can drive international visitor numbers.  Media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  The Government is continuing to support the ongoing efforts of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events.</p>  <p>   I am very hopeful that the IRFU's bid will be successful.  This, along with the recent successful bid to host part of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament at the Aviva stadium, means that sport will be playing a major part in promoting our national image abroad over the next few years.  Successful hosting of the women&rsquo;s rugby world cup here in 2017 would also help boost Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.</p></reply>

It would be a great occasion for the country.  The people of Ireland would support the women&rsquo;s rugby world cup.</p><p>When I was made Minister of State, one of my priorities to make sure women were given every opportunity to participate in sport.  In 2011, we gave &euro;141,000 for women in sports funding through the Sports Council.</p><p>In 2012 we gave &euro;120,000, while in 2013 and 2014 we gave &euro;114,000.  We gave grants of &euro;887,000 to high performers to get them prepared for the women's rugby sevens internationals in Rio.

Will it be possible to promote the image of the country as a sporting nation through this medium?  I hope it will.

The Deputy is correct that it brings people into the country who might otherwise not come.  Statistics have shown that people who have come to this country for sporting events have come back for holidays at a later stage.  We are good at a number of things in this country and one of our best things is our people. When people come here we give them a good Irish welcome and they certainly know they are in the country.  If there is one thing our people can do, it is be hospitable, and they can talk and sell a message.  We have the scenery, the beauty and the infrastructure, and in the past four years we have increased the tourism figures in very difficult times.  Last year was the best year ever for people coming from North America.  That creates badly needed jobs and revenue as almost 220,000 are employed in tourism in every corner of the country.  People talk about rural decline but this is one way we can get people here.  We have the natural infrastructure in rural Ireland and we must also continue with developments like the greenways, the Wild Atlantic Way and other such walks.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister knows that, thanks to the upturn in the economy, the traffic has increased dramatically and palpably and there are now long tailbacks on the interchange.  One can now drive from Belfast to Dunkettle thanks to Newlands Cross, and this interchange is just as busy as Newlands Cross.</p><p>Some 90,000 vehicles a day pass through that interchange, which is the same number of vehicles that pass through the Newlands Cross junction.

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  The national financial position has meant there have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding for roads over recent years.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  For this reason it has not been possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus has been to continue the maintenance and repair of roads together with a safety focused minor works programme.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the financial realities are that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 will continue to be very tight, limiting the scope for progressing additional new projects.  I know, however, that it is important to restore capital funding over time for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained and renewed to support economic development, but as of now the NRA continues to operate within a very constrained budget.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the importance of this project.  In the context of the proposed plan for Cork Harbour and Port currently being adjudicated on by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, this project is a piece of infrastructure that has a very valuable role to play in responding, in an integrated manner, to the needs of the Deputy's city and county.  I appreciate the importance of the project but having regard to the current constraints under which I am operating I am not in a position to give the Deputy the commitment he wants.</p></speech>

Can he indicate the up-to-the date cost of that project?  He will be aware that it was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in May 2013 and the compulsory purchase orders for the NRA to construct the new slip roads were also approved at that time.  Can the Minister indicate the up-to-date figure for the number of vehicles passing though that interchange?  The figure of 90,000 vehicles per day was reported as passing through it in May 2013 and I know from my experience that number has increased but I do not know the up-to-date number.  Can the Minister make that number available?  Can he indicate a timescale as to when this project might commence?  Is it possible for the NRA as a State agency to borrow in its own right in the same way as Irish Water and other agencies can?</p></speech>

Regarding the Deputy's second question, I understand that around 76,000 cars are either in the vicinity of that point or would use that interchange.  Regarding his third point on timing, I am not in a position to give him that information because that requires a commitment from me about capital funding being available now and, regrettably, that funding is not currently available.</p>  <p>  Regarding the ability of the National Roads Authority to borrow money, I will come back to the Deputy with a written confirmation in respect of the particular point he raised.  In the context of what has happened in the past, I understand that the National Roads Authority has funded these through public private partnerships, PPP, and that could well be the approach taken for a project such as this one in terms of a bundled approach, if we were able to find a core of capital funding to move the PPP forward.  That goes back to the key point I made, namely, that to do that, a core amount of capital funding would be required to fund the hub of a PPP and that funding needs to come from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

Has a cost-benefit analysis been carried out of the cost to the State and to commuters of congestion at this interchange in Cork?</p><p> Finally, I am sure the Minister is aware of further job announcements today in Cork, and further growth in the harbour area and in the entire region, which is very welcome.  Will he agree that it would be important now for the Government to prioritise this particular bottleneck, which is currently the only blockage, to ensure motorists could have a free run from Belfast to Macroom?</p></speech>

I would be confident, however, that if there is such a study it would show that there is an economic cost to those levels of congestion, not to mention a social and personal cost for people in terms of spending so much time in traffic.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's second question was whether I accept there is a need for this project.  What we have done in terms of decisions we have made elsewhere, for example, Newlands Cross, is sought to fund projects that, when delivered in conjunction with transport infrastructure already in place, relieved congestion and made it more efficient for traffic to flow.  As I said in my initial answer to the question, I understand this is an important project.  I understand it would become even more important were the Cork Harbour project to move ahead, which is a decision An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make in terms of planning conditions it may impose with regard to it.  However, I have to view all of those projects inside the fixed amount of capital I have available to me, although I hope that amount of capital will increase in the future.</p></speech>

Its history is 18 years of jobs for the boys at the top, with lavish salaries and expenses, who have run the harbour into the ground.  We have had another nail in the coffin with the Stena service being withdrawn.  I am asking the Minister if we can simply dissolve D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and put it back under direct council control where the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire can have some say about how we can save the harbour as an amenity and a working harbour.</p></reply>

My officials are currently finalising the text of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2015.  The Bill will provide the legal basis for the transfer by ministerial orders of the five designated ports of regional significance, which are Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.  I expect shortly to seek Government approval of the Bill and to commence its passage through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Bill is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility and will allow for either a transfer to the local authority of the ministerial shareholding in a particular company or a transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees of the port company to the local authority and the dissolution of that company's corporate structure.  Ahead of the Bill&rsquo;s enactment, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will carry out a full due diligence of the harbour company.  I look forward to the completion of that process and receipt of its findings and the council&rsquo;s perspective thereon.</p>  <p>  Obviously, the optimal manner of transfer is one which finds broad based consensus and agreement between all parties.  I am committed to working with both the company and the council to ensure the sustainable future of the harbour.</p></reply>

I am very glad that we are moving the harbour company back under council control.  It is something we have been calling for in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for a long time but the issue left hanging by the former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was whether it would be a corporate subsidiary or directly under the council.  The former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said he favoured it being a corporate subsidiary.  I want clarity, and a commitment, that it will not be a corporate subsidiary because in terms of the jobs for the boys, the management structure, administration, excessive fees, excessive salaries and massive amounts of money wasted on master plans that never came to fruition, there was waste at every level while the harbour itself has been run into the ground and the front-line staff reduced to negligible numbers.  It has been a failure.</p><p> To give the Minister some idea, this harbour company has 20 employees left and the CEO gets &euro;136,000 a year, &euro;12,000 on top of that in fees for going to nine meetings a year and &euro;10,000 extra in expenses for reasons unknown - he used to get &euro;20,000 until we kicked up about it.  In answer to a question about another &euro;20,000 he paid himself, he stated he paid that in lieu of holidays, which one is not allowed to do.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, stated that was unacceptable.  We still have not received an explanation of it.</p> <p> There are millions of euro wasted on master plans that have never come to fruition.  It is a honey pot that is being exploited by these executives through directors' fees etc. while the harbour has been run into the ground.  Can the Minister bring the harbour back fully under local authority control and get rid of this structure?</p></speech>

I am well aware of the challenges that the port faces to be sustainable in the future due in no small part to the decision of Stena Sealink to consolidate its services within Dublin Port.</p>  <p>  It is necessary that issues in relation to the development of that harbour be handled in the context of it residing within the local authority and I will be making a decision soon regarding the method within which that will happen.  Alongside that, I need to introduce the Bill that will give statutory footing to the harbour policy, as I outlined earlier, and I may need to get Government agreement to do that soon.</p></speech>

One can go on through the list.  Millions of euro were wasted on consultants' plans when the harbour, as an amenity and a working port, has been run into the ground.  This wasteful, parasitical executive management and board structure must be dissolved.  One could save &euro;600,000 a year if one did so, and that could be put in to employing staff to do real work to develop it as a public amenity and working harbour, which these persons have singularly failed to do.</p></speech>

I will gain Government agreement to the heads of the Bill and will introduce the legislation shortly afterwards.</p>  <p>  As I stated, when that is in place I will make a decision regarding how that integration will best happen.  My objective is to come up with a way in which that port can have a secure and sustainable future.  I am very much aware that some of the recent decisions that have been made, particularly the decision by Stena Sealink, have severe consequences for that port, and that is best handled inside the local authority.</p></speech>

I accept that different parts of the network meet existing regional needs on which we touched earlier in the debate on rural bus services.  That funding is in place to maintain those lines.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to initiate a consultation process on the future of rail in the country because it is important that people are clear on the level of funding that is going into rail at present and the consequences of that funding on the Department's ability to deliver other transport objectives.</p></speech>

It serves a regional need, from south Laois right down through north Tipperary and into Limerick Junction, and it is important that it is retained.  Students use it.  Commuters use it for work in Limerick.  Residents from south Laois take the train from Ballybrophy.</p>  <p>  The line has been upgraded in recent years.  There has been substantial funding put into the line, particularly from Roscrea southward, and it is important that we do not close it after upgrading it.  There is a section of it still to be upgraded.</p>  <p>  The Government should ensure that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann comes forward with a business plan to grow the amount of business on the line.  I will not have the opportunity to contribute again because of time, but I ask also that the line should be used for freight.  What is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann doing to develop the level of freight business on that line?  Currently, it is used only for passengers.  It is not used 23 hours a day.  We should be looking at getting other business onto the tracks.  The tracks are there and there was considerable funding put into it.  We need to develop the business.  I would like to see such opportunities being taken up.</p>  <p>  Also, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should strive to increase the number of passengers using the service.  There is potential to develop both tourism and freight services along with the ordinary passenger services.  I would like the Minister to get Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to bring forward a plan for that railway line.</p></speech>

First, there has been an increase overall in the number of passengers who avail of train services on the rail network.  There was an increase in funding of &euro;101 million or 3% last year over the previous year.  This is a reflection of the changes made by Irish Rail and also the economic recovery that is underway.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Stanley's particular point on that line, I emphasise that I have the funding in place to maintain the network as it stands at present for the foreseeable future but we need to have a debate and broader understanding in the country regarding the amount of funding that goes into sustaining the heavy rail network and its consequences for the decisions that we need to make for all of the land transport needs in the country for the years to come.</p></speech>

The Government then put forward the line that somehow it was the borrowers' fault and that those in arrears were not engaging with the banks.  Two days later, after the Taoiseach denied that there was any need for any change - the Minister for Finance, following the listing of over 200 repossession cases in court in Limerick, came forward and said that to be fair to the banks, they were just getting involved to force people to engage.  That was both a dishonest and detached intervention by the Minister for Finance.  The banks are not bringing people to court to force them to engage because, as FLAC has pointed out, there is no legal aid or remedy available once they get into court.  They are being brought to court because property prices are rising, valuations are rising and the banks can now get their money back.</p></speech>

Such adjustments would include increasing awareness of what the insolvency service is about and the assistance it can give to those families whose mortgages are in distress; an independent audit of the quality of the deals recommended by the personal insolvency practitioners; and an outline of the options that are open to borrowers where insolvency arrangements have been rejected by the creditors, that is, the banks as well as the supports available to families who cannot meet the terms of restructured mortgages negotiated within the insolvency framework.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that 110,000 accounts were in arrears at the end of quarter four of 2014, a decline of 26,000 over the course of the year.  Of the 100,000 mortgages that have been restructured, the vast majority of those involved are meeting the demands and conditions of their restructured accounts.</p>  <p>  I confirmed this morning, as did the T&aacute;naiste, that the Government has almost completed its review of these matters and will bring forward a number of other measures that will compliment the range of options that are there at the moment so that we can deal with mortgages in distress in April.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach made reference to adjustments and named three items that are not adjustments at all.  Making people aware of something is not changing anything.  An independent audit of how poorly a system is working is not changing anything, with only 199 cases concluded to date.  The third point I could not quite understand, to be frank.  The Taoiseach said there were options open to borrowers and he drifted off into an inaudible whisper.  I mean it sincerely when I say that I did not catch the third point.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance insisted that the Government is watching the situation very carefully and is also watching the way in which the insolvency legislation is being applied.  He said the Government is very conscious of the policy.  It was Deputy Noonan who said that the banks were using the courts to get people to engage with them who have not done so thus far.  I brought an example of a case before the Taoiseach last week, where the couple involved were working for over two years to try to get the bank to engage.</p></speech>

It is an insult to those people when a Government Minister or the Taoiseach says they are only being brought to court because the banks want them to engage because they have not done so to date.  That is not the truth.  There are lots of people out there who are at their wits' end.  These are responsible people who want to keep a roof over their children's heads, who have been engaging with banks but the banks have not been engaging with them or making any realistic attempt to bring about sustainable resolutions.  If the Taoiseach is to do anything, he should stop insulting people who are going through the trauma and anxiety of these court cases.  For them, it is not fun.  This is not, as the Minister implied, some tactical manoeuvre that the banks are engaged in.</p>  <p>  In short, if one looks at the language emanating from Government, it is "watching" this, "monitoring" that but in essence it is doing absolutely nothing to deal with the escalating problem of repossessions and mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

It is also fair to look to the situation that has arisen in the context of people who are looking for credit whereby the Credit Review Office gives an independent view and has given directions to banks to overturn decisions.  The Minister for Justice and Equality of the day brought in an amendment so that when cases went to court, an independent review of the options put forward by the practitioner would be possible before a court case situation arises.</p></speech>

Martin McGuinness discovered that it was the intention of the DUP to provide only partial protection to current recipients of benefits and no protection whatsoever for future recipients contrary to the Stormont House Agreement.  In our view, it intended concealing this until after the welfare reform legislation was passed.</p> <p> I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this is not part of the Stormont House Agreement.  As a result, Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP had no option but to prevent the Welfare Reform Bill going through the Assembly.  Martin McGuinness has made it clear that it is our focus to resolve these problems.  Our record has been very consistent.  The late Ian Paisley said that Sinn F&eacute;in kept every promise it made.  Despite refusals to honour the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including the absence of Acht na Gaeilge, a bill of rights, a civic forum and an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, Sinn F&eacute;in has not given up on the process and we will not give up on the process.</p> <p> It is clear, however, that political institutions must deliver for citizens, particularly disadvantaged citizens and those with disabilities.  That is more important than other considerations.  Does the Taoiseach agree that a resolution to the current difficulties will only be found by everyone adhering fully to the terms of the Stormont House Agreement?</p></speech>

The opportunity for both Governments to become involved as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement together with the dedicated work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sherlock, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the parties brought about the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  I am interested to hear Deputy Adams say that the Deputy First Minister discovered that the DUP was not going to implement the agreement that was arrived at.  It should also be noted that the Minister and Minister of State from this Government were not party to the detailed discussions about welfare reform that were an element of the agreement being arrived at.  I am not sure how the Deputy First Minister discovered that the DUP intended to renege on the agreement if this is the case.  Was it through a memorandum, comment or paper provided by the DUP saying that it intended to renege on the agreement?</p>  <p>  With the British general election taking place early in May, there is an opportunity to work this out as mature politicians.  The essence of politics is called into being here.  This can only be dealt with by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister who must explain to the other parties what this row is about.  I would like to find out the nature of the discovery that the Deputy First Minister was able to make.  How was he able to discover that the DUP suddenly intended at a certain point to renege on an agreement entered into in December?  I agree with the Deputy that this should not have happened and can be rectified.  It can only be rectified by the politicians hammering out what it is they agreed upon and being very clear about it in the interest of the people of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Martin McGuinness discovered it because we were given papers - we believe by mistake.  When he discovered this, he spent several days last week, including during our Ard-Fheis, trying to meet the DUP.  The DUP failed to engage with us but it was fully informed about our concerns.  These are red line issues because the essence of mature politics must be protecting the disadvantaged - those who need the protection of society.  That is the core of this agreement.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may recall that in 1998, just after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Senator George Mitchell said that this was the easy bit and that the hard bit was implementing it.  That has been our experience.  I have been critical at times of the Government's handling of Northern Ireland issues but at the same time, I know that they are very challenging and require a constant focus with the British Government on the ongoing process to ensure in particular the need for everyone to fulfil commitments.  In the absence of such clarity, every effort must be made to ensure all agreements are faithfully implemented.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the resolution of the current difficulties will be only be found by everyone adhering fully to the terms of the Stormont House Agreement?</p></speech>

I do not have in front of me the difference between the detailed discussions on welfare reform conducted before Christmas before the agreement was arrived at and the details that apply now for welfare reform since the agreement was put together.  There seems to be a discrepancy somewhere in the mathematics if this is what the row is about.  Obviously, the Government was not party to the detailed discussions prior to Christmas about what welfare reform would mean for people but there seems to be a change in the figures that apply.  I think one must go back to that point - what was laid out in detail in papers before Christmas and what has brought about a change in those figures that affect people with social welfare payments in various forms in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  This is a very serious political matter.  These institutions have paved the way for many years since the Good Friday Agreement.  It has not been an easy journey in many respects.  This row was brewing before Christmas.  All of the parties and the two Governments got involved and agreement was reached on a set of figures with details about them.  The agreement was signed off, accepted and welcomed by everybody.

Today, that same agenda is creating huge uncertainty among Aer Lingus workers, their families and the communities who depend on Aer Lingus for employment and connectivity.  This anxiety has been created by the Government refusing to reject decisively the bid by IAG to buy the Government's shares.  It is a decision that could see us relinquish any public control over the airline and this island's aviation bridge to the rest of the world, leaving foreign-owned private companies whose only concern is profit with full control over access in and out of this country.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has sent IAG off with a little tut-tut to come back with a better price in the next few weeks, but the consequences for this country will last far longer than it will take to spend the bag of silver the Government will get for any sale of Aer Lingus.  Not only would this country lose a profitable company, something the Government spends a fortune sending the IDA out to find, there are massive implications for north Dublin, Cork, Shannon and the Limerick regions which are struggling in the recession.</p>  <p>  We are told relentlessly by the media that poor little Aer Lingus will not survive alone, but poor little Aer Lingus has been making healthy profits for years.  In 2013, it made an operating profit of &euro;61.1 million.  The Taoiseach might tell some of his young Deputies like the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, if they can contain themselves for a moment with the flattery and attention from this multinational company, that Aer Lingus does not need IAG.</p></speech>

Deputy Coppinger appears to be of the view that the Government should acquire Aer Lingus in its entirety.  This would cost about &euro;1 billion.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government rejected the bid from IAG.</p>  <p>  In 2012, the Government decided that consideration could be given to the sale of the shares held by the State in Aer Lingus in the context of the sale of a number of assets that might be disposed of if the price and conditions of any such sale were in the best interests of the people.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, is very clear on that.  Issues such as the Heathrow slots, connectivity to the United States and operations at Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports are matters of genuine concern and interest to workers, their families and other people in localities and environs of Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  It is already public knowledge that there will be a further meeting between officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and IAG this week.  Obviously, the Department will inform the Minister of the issues presented by IAG during that discussion.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has not made, and is not in a position to make, a recommendation to the Government.  The conditions set out by Government in regard to Aer Lingus are clear.  This airline was privatised a number of years ago under a different Administration.  The Government now holds a 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus on behalf of the people.  The conditions set by it in terms of consideration of any offer are clear and have not been met in any discussions that have taken place to date.</p></speech>

It appears to me from the Taoiseach's response that the Government is well disposed towards selling off the remaining public control of Aer Lingus.  This means that very shortly thousands of jobs not only in north Dublin but in Cork, Limerick and the Shannon area will be jeopardised.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the Taoiseach read the article by the economist Paul Sweeney last Friday in which he made an excellent case not only for the retention of the State's 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus but for the Government to seek to buy, for example, Ryanair's shares, which will most likely become available soon.  The case was extremely well made that the Government should snap those up.  How is regional development to be protected if a private company controls Aer Lingus?  As it stands, any scale-down of operations in, for example, Cork Airport would have a devastating impact.  Owing to the recession and the withdrawal of the Shannon stopovers, Limerick is on its knees.  There are huge issues at stake.  </p>  <p>  It is a pity there is no member of the Labour Party in the House to hear this debate.</p></speech>

Clearly, the issues raised are of a very serious nature, relating not only to serious criminal activity but also to the potential risk to children from people who were hidden away in our communities by these organisations.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently investigating information on these issues which they have received from a number of people.  These Garda investigations are ongoing and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them, except to say that they are a priority given the child protection concerns and the seriousness of the alleged offences involved.</p><p>I would further add that it is important to continue to encourage people with any relevant information to come forward to the authorities.</p> <p> I have not discussed the allegations of sexual abuse with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, nor did I discuss the issue with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, or the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council or at the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in November.  As Deputies are aware, justice and policing matters are not sectoral areas covered in the North-South Ministerial Council framework.  North-South co-operation in these areas takes place bilaterally.  However, the health and child welfare aspects of child protection are included in the NSMC framework.  The plenary meeting in Armagh in December had a very useful discussion on child protection and noted that very good collaborative work is already taking place, both within the NSMC structures and elsewhere.</p> <p> On the margins of this meeting, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, also had the opportunity to discuss the issues arising as part of their ongoing co-operation and work in this area.  The Ministers are anxious to ensure that the issues arising are fully addressed and they are looking closely at the best way in which that can be done.  The Minister is briefed on this issue on an ongoing basis.  Arising from their discussions, the Ministers have tasked the relevant officials in their Departments to examine the legal and practical issues that might arise which relate to the issue of establishing forms of inquiry.  Their officials are currently carrying out detailed, joint work in that regard and they will report on developments to Ministers in the near future.  This process of examination is being done against the background of the various investigations, North and South, that are under way into aspects of this issue.  As the House is now aware, more immediate and recent allegations have been made of a similar nature that are the subject of a television programme later today.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000021#T00300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Very often issues get a wave of attention in the public media and then tend to drift to the side in terms of consistency of focus and urgent intervention mechanisms that should have been put in place to enable their further investigation and also to facilitate other victims to come forward.  We were shocked by the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelations because they revealed a very dark side to the Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA movement over a number of decades, and in particular the degree to which sex abusers within the movement were protected as a deliberate strategy.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that when victims come forward to speak, the very least that should be done is that they should be allowed to speak free of any attempt to undermine them or their integrity.  I just spoke with Ma&iacute;ria Cahill before I came to the Chamber this afternoon.  She again asked that the online campaign that has been ongoing on a daily basis to undermine her and abuse her should stop.  I recall the words of the T&aacute;naiste to Deputy Adams that he would please call off the dogs of war on Ma&iacute;ria Cahill in terms of the vicious online abuse that has been an unseemly feature of what has transpired since Ma&iacute;ria Cahill gave her interviews.</p>  <p>  This evening, there will be further revelations on the "Spotlight" programme by Paudie McGahon, yet another victim of abuse by a senior IRA member.  I met with Paudie McGahon quite some time ago.  I did not seek the meeting, nor have I ever tried to utilise any of these issues for political gain, as has been alleged.  That is a constant mantra trotted out by Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  When victims come forward, they come forward.  I have met victims in many different walks of life who were victims of various institutions.  It just so happens that in this case two victims came to tell me their story and Paudie McGahon was one of them.  It is a horrific story in itself about the abuse that was perpetrated on him by a senior member of the IRA, but worse again is the fact that a kangaroo court was held.  He was invited to the kangaroo court by a Sinn F&eacute;in public representative and by the IRA movement.  He was given a range of advices.  He was informed that the member who had abused him was in custody and had been guilty of abusing other victims.  They were invited to either dispose of the individual themselves; that the IRA would dispose of him; or other options.</p>  <p>  Implicit in all of that is a refusal to bring all of that information to the Garda.  The people in possession of the knowledge relating to Paudie McGahon should not have protected the individual concerned but should have sent all of the detail to the Garda, but they did not.  He was told himself that if he whispered anything to the Garda, he would be found at the side of a road somewhere.  That is the level of protection he got as a victim.  It is extremely sickening to have to listen to protestations about the past and respite for people in the past when a case such as this happened in recent times, namely, 2002.  Paudie McGahon was asked if he wanted to see an in-house psychologist that the IRA movement itself was making available to help him deal with the situation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams himself said he is aware that the Provisional IRA took actions in relation to abusers which involved keeping the crimes away from the authorities, but so too did Sinn F&eacute;in on this occasion.  There was not the usual divide between the military and civil wings in this respect.  Both were acting in unison and concord in dealing with this particular case.  Honest and transparent answers are required, not attempts to bury the case in the past and into a process which would mean it would not get any articulation.  I asked the Taoiseach about the matter in my questions.  I went to Belfast to speak with the Minister of Justice, Mr. Ford, in the aftermath of the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case.  I believe a cross-Border mechanism should be developed to at least facilitate other victims to come forward, who might not want to go public.  Victims themselves can decide whether they want to go public.  In order to get some sense of closure on abuse they suffered, there should at least be some opportunity to articulate it and bring it forward to a proper forum which would have the right capacity, backup and supports to enable victims to achieve that.</p>  <p>  There is a need for far more urgent intervention with both the Northern authorities and the British Government.  We hear a lot about the past, which is important, but this is just as important as other issues that have been dealt with on a government-to-government basis.  I refer to big cases that were the subject of the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and other agreements.  This is just as important but there is no excuse for it to be put to one side because it might not suit or be politically convenient.  I ask that the Taoiseach would engage with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and the Northern Ireland Executive to pursue the matter more vigorously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000021#T00400"><p>Nobody doubts the seriousness of the issue.  There should not be and there cannot be a hiding place for those who carry out those kind of offences.  Under the North-South Ministerial Council, although it is not specifically part of the remit of the council, the issues are dealt with bilaterally.  I did receive a letter from the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, in regard to a proposal for the establishment through the North-South Ministerial Council of an all-island process to deal with the issue of support mechanisms for those who were victims of sexual abuse during the Troubles, and that it would include support for victims of abuse in all communities and to ensure greater access to counselling and other supports for victims of abuse, and to facilitate victims and survivors in accessing the justice system and making official complaints.  I responded to that letter because people should be aware of the specific processes ongoing in Northern Ireland, namely, the review by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions and the reference to the Police Ombudsman's office in respect of a specific case.</p><p>It is important that the relevant authorities, North and South, are able to proceed unimpeded with their work in this regard.  I completely agree with Deputy Martin that it is simply not good enough and absolutely appalling that a victim of abuse is being pressurised in whatever fashion, by whomever on the instructions of whomever.  </p> <p> The Deputy is aware that the Garda liaises closely with Tusla in respect of any child protection concerns that arise, in accordance with the standing protocol between the two services.  It also liaises closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of any criminal activity or child protection issues that arise. </p> <p> As far as I am aware, since the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelations became public and the discussion in the D&aacute;il, no new information has come into the possession of the Department of Justice and Equality arising from Ms Cahill's revelations or from information received by Deputies Doherty and Adams.  This does not mean the Garda has not uncovered or come across information that is not yet known to the Department or publicly.  It may well be that it has come across other information.  </p> <p> When this issue first emerged, we considered whether to have some form of joint North-South inquiry or commission.  As the North and South are two separate legal jurisdictions, it is not as simple as it may appear to take this kind of approach.  At the moment, we have close co-operation and the offices of the Police Ombudsman and Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland are carrying out independent investigations.  The Garda is also liaising with Tusla and is in touch with the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, the Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, are obviously involved in the current situation and some further action may come out of it.  </p> <p> I am not sure whether one should set up an institution.  The Deputy First Minister wrote to me about having a process by which these matters could be dealt with.  A number of independent entities are already dealing with this and it is a case of deciding what is the best thing to do here.  We do not want to interfere with the Director of Public Prosecutions and Police Ombudsman's offices in Northern Ireland or the relationship between Tusla and the Garda or the information that may be passing between them.  However, nobody can argue with the seriousness of this matter.</p> <p> I have not met Mr. McGahon who made comments publicly today and is, I understand, the subject of a television programme later this evening.  We should all view this matter with the utmost seriousness.  Those in organisations or entities who have information should come forward with it and those who have the courage to speak out should not be abused or pressurised on the instructions of people who might not want his kind of information to come into the public domain in the first place.  I admire their courage and we should do everything we can to have this work done unimpeded and in a confidential manner.</p> <p> This issue is far too serious for general assumptions.  These are serious cases which the victims must carry with them every day of their lives.  Politicians must decide what is the best thing to do here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000022#U00200"><p>I very much appreciate the Taoiseach's appeal for people to be very careful about what they say in this House because these matters are under investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This has not stopped the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader from naming a private citizen in the Chamber in the past in connection with the most serious of allegations.  It did not stop the Taoiseach from asserting that some people suffered mistreatment at the hands of members of Sinn F&eacute;in, nor the Fianna F&aacute;il leader from making similar assertions.  Victims not only require and have the right to support, but no one should be pressurised or subjected to any campaign of harassment either online or in any other way.</p>  <p>  I have also read in the media that allegations made by a County Louth man, Paudie McGahon, are to be rehearsed in a television programme this evening.  The agencies to deal with allegations of abuse are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and social services.  From what I have read, Mr. McGahon clearly feels badly let down.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader and Taoiseach made the assertion that some of the abusers were associated with republicanism.  If that is the case, they did not act in our name or in the names of the people who suffered for the republican cause over a very long time.  Paudie McGahon feels badly let down and nothing I say may change that.  This is a matter of very deep regret to me.  Mr. McGahon needs support and justice.  I am assured, contrary to what the Fianna F&aacute;il stated, that when this case was brought to the attention of local representatives, the victim of the alleged abuse was advised in person and in writing to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  Last November, the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, wrote to the Taoiseach and proposed the establishment, through the North-South Ministerial Council, of a clearly defined, all-island process to deal with the issue of providing support mechanisms for all those who were victims of sexual abuse during the conflict.  We know that one in four people suffers abuse, mainly by a family member, and that society has been remiss in dealing with these issues.  The Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelation brought a very clear focus on those who had been abused during the conflict and were not properly dealt with by state agencies, statutory bodies and, in some cases, republicans.</p>  <p>  The Deputy First Minister's letter set out objectives to support victims of abuse in all communities, ensure greater access to counselling and other supports for victims and facilitate victims and survivors in assessing the justice system and making official complaints.  In addition, the letter states that the anonymity and confidentiality of victims and survivors who did not wish to be identified should be acknowledged and protected.  The Deputy First Minister also argued for the promotion of existing helplines and, if necessary, dedicated hotlines, North and South, to facilitate victims and survivors who wish to come forward.  These are A, B and C steps that could be easily taken.  The Taoiseach has not responded to these propositions in the way he should.  The Deputy First Minister has written to him on three occasions and first put his proposals in November 2014.  It is now March and Martin McGuinness has expressed his concern at the lack of engagement by the Taoiseach on his proposals. </p>  <p>  I do not have any objections, and nor should I have, to these matters being rehearsed in this Chamber.  A great deal needs to be done in terms of funding rape crisis centres, providing protections and so forth.  However, we need to move beyond commentary and establish mechanisms and processes which deal with the unique circumstance of what occurred during the conflict.</p><p>If the mechanisms that the Deputy First Minister is putting forward are not sufficient and if we cannot get a North-South focus on this beyond what we have at the moment, the Taoiseach should bring forward some other proposition.</p> <p> It is very disappointing that this has not been responded to in the way that it should have been.  When we had the debate in the House last November I was very critical of the way the Government parties and the Leader of the Opposition dealt with the issues.  I concluded by saying: "I suppose I should not judge them on what they say in this particular debate as we will all be judged on what we do to protect children and the rights of women."  I believe we stand open to the accusation that we have not dealt with this issue in the way that it should have been dealt with.</p> <p> I appeal to the Taoiseach once again.  The fact that the Deputy First Minister has not got even the courtesy of a response to what was a serious proposition by him is disappointing indeed.  This is for all the victims and all the survivors.  Obviously, I have a clear focus on those who may have been victims of those who purported to be republicans.  However, there are many other folks outside of that group who also need support.  That between the two Administrations, North and South, we have not moved on this is a matter of some disappointment.</p></speech>

He asked for a process to be put in place.  I assume that means there would be an end to that process in any individual case.  I presume that would mean a person or persons would be brought before the court and that the law would take its course.  If an allegation is made about sexual abuse, either an individual case or in respect of an individual over a period, the process would be that if that person decides to speak out, he or she would be able to do so in a protected way and not be pressurised in any way subsequently.  The situation from a legal point of view would be followed through, and if allegations are made against perpetrators, they would be brought before the authorities and a decision made on whether they are guilty or otherwise.</p>  <p>  Two independent investigations are ongoing, undertaken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is briefed by the Garda as needs be and in respect of whatever information comes to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  I have no wish to prejudge a television programme which, I understand, is taking place this evening, but I understand when the person involved met a Garda superintendent in October last year, he was advised of the supports available to him.  He subsequently made a formal complaint to the Garda and a criminal investigation was launched.  That investigation is ongoing.  My understanding is that the person involved said that he had been abused by a member of the Provisional IRA who stayed at his family home, which was then deemed to be a safe house.  He said his life was threatened by the abuser.  I understand he has also alleged that his brother was abused, but he declined to be public about that allegation and has not pursued a formal complaint with the Garda.  He maintains that he alleged in the early 2000s that he brought the matter to the attention of a local councillor who arranged for what he called a process to be put in place to deal with the allegation and punish the alleged abuser.  He and another victim, his brother, were brought before a number of republican members, including a named person who is a former member of the Provisional IRA, to be interviewed about their allegations.  He says that he was offered a choice of punishments for the alleged abuser, including that he would be killed, and that he opted to have him exiled.</p>  <p>  This is a kangaroo court operating outside the jurisdiction of a democracy and the remit of the law of the land as we know it.  I am unsure whether Deputy Adams has any information or has been given any information about this, but this kind of situation is intolerable.  It goes back to what Ma&iacute;ria Cahill made public with her remarks to the effect that hers was not the only case.</p>  <p>  If we are dealing with a process involving these serious allegations, then I am prepared to work with the Northern Ireland Executive First Minister and Deputy First Minister, just as the Minister for Justice and Equality is with her counterpart, whether through the North-South Ministerial Council or whatever.  It is not as simple as it sounds to set up an institution covering two jurisdictions with different legal systems.  At the end of the day, if people are sexually abused over a period or threatened and pressurised, then we have to have a system of law that can deal with that.  If the allegations being made by this individual are correct, then it was clearly on the instructions of a person or persons to have a court of punishment and interrogation, and that has nothing to do with the law of the land.</p>  <p>  For my part, in replying to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, I would point out that there are two independent operations, Tusla and its remit as well as co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI.  There is consultation between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, together with their respective Departments.  Aside from that I do not believe we need an institution for cross-Border justice.  It seems as if the allegations made are that such an institution was set up illegally with threats of death, exile and interrogation at the core of it.</p>  <p>  If it is a process the Deputy First Minister is looking for, I believe that through all these elements, organisations and agencies operating strictly within the law, it should be possible to have a process of support generally for victims of sexual abuse in any community.  It should also be possible for those who have the courage to speak out in respect of many of the details, circumstances and names, in some cases, of persons who are alleged to have committed the offences and put all of that together.  I am perfectly happy to speak to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, arising from my response to him to see how this might best be done.  However, that does not involve getting into legalities about the different legal systems and how this might operate.</p>  <p>  In this case there are allegations about republican abuse or abuse by persons who were members of the Provisional IRA.  If a young man or woman has been sexually abused, they have to carry that with them all their lives.  We should try in every way we can to see that they get the support and counselling they need and deserve, and that where allegations can be proven, the law of the land takes its course in respect of those who might have committed those offences.</p></speech>

He is correct in saying that, in the Paudie McGahon case, we are talking about a safe house.  I think Deputy Adams and those in Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA will have been very well aware of the circumstances of this for a long time, just as they were well aware of the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case for a long time but chose to do nothing about it either, or about the entire system.</p>  <p>  It is all very well for Deputy Adams to say, "We will be judged in terms of what we do now or into the future".  I would like to think people would judge according to what people did when they first heard of these cases or what they did not do.  We know from the public record of this House that Deputy Adams himself has admitted this and put it on the public record.  He accused me of making some assertion about this earlier, and the Taoiseach too, but it was actually Deputy Adams on the public record in this House who said that the Provisional IRA took actions in regard to abusers which involved keeping the crimes away from the authorities, and that the IRA dealt with it itself internally.  He then kind of said, "Well, that was unfortunate but they had no alternative".  They put forward the untruth that it was because of the RUC and all this kind of stuff.</p>  <p>  If we go through all of the sequences and the commentary that has been made, there is a complete thread of inconsistency between what is said one week compared with what is said the next week.  That is why the bona fides of what Deputy Adams says have to be questioned.  It is very difficult to take them on board given his track record in response to these issues on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

This is not an allegation.  I am not making an allegation at all in regard to this.  Deputy Adams himself has said that this is the way the Provisional IRA dealt with these issues, and that it was unfortunate and that it was a pity it happened that way.  He then tried to say it was because of the lack of policing at the time and all of that.  In these cases, however, both in the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case and the Paudie McGahon case, we are talking about much more recent times.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the reason a mechanism is required is that there is a lot of fear.  These people who come forward have been afraid for a long time.  They are afraid of the IRA and the IRA community.  There is a palpable fear in terms of what might happen to them.  We cannot dismiss that because it is just the reality, and we can hear it from the mouths of those who have been abused.  There is an absence of trust, particularly when they have been through the kangaroo courts in regard to these issues.  There is a fundamental fear and an absence of trust.  Not everyone will come forward and the majority will not come forward for those reasons.  They will say to themselves: "Leave well alone."  It takes a particular type of courage and commitment to come forward, and it is the individuals themselves who make that decision.  I want to stress that point.  We know from other inquiries, however, that if mechanisms are created with confidential frameworks and so on, it is possible to get a better understanding of what happened.</p>  <p>  I am under no illusions, despite what has been said, that Deputy Adams himself will be very well aware of the mechanisms and the procedures by which the IRA dealt with all of these issues, because he said it himself.  He denies other things.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would say I am making allegations if I say that I know he was a former chief of staff of the IRA.  It has been said.</p></speech>

It just beggars belief.  That is the point in regard to all of it.  This is not something new.  I think the Taoiseach needs to work with either the British Prime Minister or the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland in regard to facilitating victims coming forward to deal with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000024#W01500"><p>The Garda and the PSNI continue to carry out their investigations on these matters.  I have no doubt about the allegations that were made.  We know the cost of ignoring information brought by children or young people generally in this jurisdiction, and of ignoring the seriousness of the allegations that many of them have made.  However, when there are criminal investigations going on into a number of these matters, both here and in Northern Ireland, it is complicated to have a process running parallel to that.  These are criminal investigations.  It is important that the courts are there to deal with the end of that particular investigative process and that people are brought before the courts to determine by judge and jury whether they are guilty of allegations made.  To have a process mixed up in the middle of that at the moment is not the way I think this should happen.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy First Minister himself admitted in public he was a member of the IRA.  The names that are mentioned here are well known to them.  I do not know whether Deputy Adams has spoken to the person who is named as a public representative.  If there is information that needs to be given to the PSNI or the Garda, then it should be.  This is a very serious charge.  It is also a very serious matter to say that a person was hauled before people to be questioned and a range of punishment options set out for them to become judge and jury themselves.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin.  Imagine a young man being fearful of something like this.  Can we imagine the difficulty there was and the challenge it was for a young woman to make the allegations in public that she made?  Despite this, we find that she has been pressurised and contacted in the most vile ways as a consequence.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister, Mr. Ford, have a very close working relationship in these matters, as have the PSNI and the Garda.  I do not think any of us wants to interfere with the ongoing criminal investigative process, and I am quite sure it is a serious analysis by the PSNI and the Garda.  I do not think I should put forward a view that, because this is proceeding, we should set up a process here.  That investigative process is designed to lead to a conclusion that either there is validity or there is not, and, if there is, there are the court proceedings to follow.  As I said during my reply to the Deputy First Minister, there need to be counselling services and support systems for victims of abuse in whatever community or wherever they come from.  That is something that is dealt with bilaterally by the Minister for Justice and Equality, with the Minister in Northern Ireland, through the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  I can discuss this with Prime Minister Cameron, not on the individual cases but in terms of whether there is a mechanism through which we can deal with this, when criminal investigations cease, on the basis of support, encouragement, mentoring and protection.  The courts are independent in the way they do their business and this would have to cross the two jurisdictions, but that should not prove to be an impossibility.</p><p>I take what the Deputy said in the sense in which he said it.  It is something that now seethes inside people.  They find the courage, after all these years, to speak out.  We have to devise a mechanism to support that courage and protect people, while at the same time allowing criminal investigations to take place so that the courts can do their duty whenever that become necessary.  Deputy Adams might have something to add to that in the context of the public representative named or the matter to which Deputy Martin referred, namely, former members of the Provisional IRA.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000025#X00200"><p>If these issues were not so serious and if so many people's lives had not been destroyed by what had occurred, the process of debate and discussion here would be a very educational one.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader spoke about the IRA community, Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA, the IRA running Sinn F&eacute;in and so on and so forth.  It is clear that, whatever affinity he may have with victims and survivors, he is using this to try to make political points against the party of which I am very pleased to be a part.  He also misrepresented what I said in the Chamber.  I acknowledged the failure of republicans, including the IRA, to deal with these issues properly, and for that I apologise, as Uachtar&aacute;n Shinn F&eacute;in, because I think that is the right thing to do, especially as part of a process to face up to mistakes or failures and, in particular, to try to ensure that those mistakes and failures are not repeated.</p><p>The issue of abuse in our society is a significant one, to which we have not responded properly.  We do not have the time to discuss these matters now.  This is a very specific element of that, namely, those people who allegedly were abused by people who were purported to be IRA members.  In my remarks I said I was assured by the local representatives who were contacted that they advised the victim, verbally and in writing, to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Taoiseach went on to say, &quot;Perhaps Deputy Adams knows more about this,&quot; and so on.  </p><p>We should not deliberately confuse these issues.  If the perpetrator of abuse presents himself or herself, or if anybody has any information about that person, it is to be given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the PSNI, and the abuser should be brought through the courts.  There are no ifs or buts about that.  A survivor or victim came forward and made an allegation, which is what prompted Martin McGuinness to write to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach now says he is quite happy to talk to the Deputy First Minister about his proposal.  He wrote to the Taoiseach in November, and wrote three times in total.  He outlined in detail the types of idea that Deputy Martin spoke about earlier, namely, not getting involved in due process, criminal justice processes or what might be jurisdictional issues North and South.  Why could the North-South Ministerial Council not have met?  Why could the Taoiseach and those in the Executive not announce an all-Ireland process to encourage victims and survivors to come forward and to deal with support and mechanisms for all of them?  God knows how many people are out there who did not go to anyone, or who went to the RUC, loyalist groups and political parties and were not dealt with properly.  Without getting involved in jurisdictional or criminal justice issues, and in view of the fact that none of these issues are <i>sub judice</i>, we could announce that and tell people that confidential support and counselling mechanisms are in place.  That would have been, and still is, the thing to do.</p><p>The Taoiseach needs to appreciate something about victims.  Every time these cases are rehearsed, that traumatises other victims.  For people like Paudie McGahon or Ma&iacute;ria Cahill to come forward is very courageous, but other people have no support mechanisms, particularly those coming from what was described earlier as a period of conflict in the North which may or may not have overlapped here.</p><p>I again put it to the Taoiseach that the proposal put was above and beyond party politics, was victim and survivor-centred and could be put together easily without impinging on any other mechanisms.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have talked to some victims' and advocacy groups about this, and they continue to engage with us.  They think it is a good idea that should be opened up in the way the Deputy First Minister has suggested.  I strongly argue that this issue should have been prioritised.  It should not have had to wait until someone came forward and a television programme was made or a journalist wrote a story.</p><p>The problem is that the Taoiseach made no substantive response to what the Deputy First Minister wrote to him about.  I know good work is being done by both justice Ministers.  I know, because I talk to them, that the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are co-operating on this and a range of other issues.  When the Deputy First Minister writes to the Taoiseach about such an important issue, he at least deserves the benefit, courtesy and good manners of a substantive response.  As I said in my earlier contribution to this discussion, if there is a better way of doing things, let us find that.  That is our responsibility.</p><p>Whatever the failings of Sinn F&eacute;in in this matter, I am sure there are sexual abusers in all political parties, sectors of society, sporting organisations, churches, families and so on, and we have a responsibility to try to sort it out.  When we reduce this particular issue to the type of soundbite-based invective being rehearsed here without any substantial evidence to support it, we let survivors and victims down.  </p><p>I want to commend the proposal that has been put to the Taoiseach on four occasions in the past number of months and ask for it to be considered.  I am repeating myself, but I listened very intently to what the Taoiseach said.  This issue must not get confused with policing, judicial and justice matters.  Rather, we need to send a very clear signal that, whatever about the sins of the past, the Executive at Stormont and the Government have put together mechanisms to help those who have been let down in the past, including, as I have acknowledged, those let down by republicans.</p></speech>

They gave that person a number of options: they could either kill the alleged perpetrator or have him exiled.

The First Minister asked for those three actions and they are already happening.  Beyond that, the Minister for Justice and Equality regularly reviews with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice the ongoing criminal investigations into these allegations.  All of them are being investigated.  It is not the case that nothing is happening.  The process that the Deputy First Minister sought is already in place, but it is not a formal end of the North-South Ministerial Council and is dealt with bilaterally.  It is about how to put in place some facility, if not a structure, to expand beyond the current arrangement whereby the two Ministers discuss these issues on a regular basis with the Garda and PSNI, along with the independent investigations that are taking place.  I am not sure what more he refers to that can actually happen, when there is support, counselling and so on North and South.</p>  <p>  As far as we can be aware, there are significant numbers of other people in Northern Ireland who have this information that needs to be brought out, and they are terrified that the same thing will happen to them.  In other words, if they speak, they might find themselves on a lonely road or whatever.  That is not acceptable in any circumstances, no matter what organisation those people were members of - the republican movement, the provisional IRA, or any party.</p>  <p>  I do not have a difficulty saying to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, or the North-South Ministerial Council what else we in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland can do beyond what is being sought by the Deputy First Minister, which is already in place.  I do not want to prejudge the outcome of comments made or the response given by Sinn F&eacute;in public representatives or others who speak on their behalf on a television programme to be transmitted this evening.  It is a matter of the most serious concern and one that should not be conditional on what we must do.</p></speech>

We have seen a variety of media reports and selective leaks to certain media outlets about what is going on in respect of conflicting evidence from senior civil servants and witnesses, and the letter that emanated from the chairman of the tribunal to the Taoiseach some weeks back.  It took six weeks to put the interim report on procedural matters on the web.  It is completely unacceptable that we have been kept in the dark for so long on a matter of such public importance.  This could have been dealt with if, from day one, the Taoiseach had given straight answers to some questions on Leaders&rsquo; Questions in the D&aacute;il.  The Taoiseach should make a statement to the House on this issue.  I ask him to give Government time to statements on why a Garda Commissioner had to resign and the circumstances surrounding his departure.  It is unacceptable that we have been kept in the dark for a full 12 months and are likely to be kept in the dark for an indefinite time.</p></speech>

Commissions of inquiry were never intended to keep basic truths from the public.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm the wording for the Irish language version of the marriage equality amendment to the Constitution?  I thought there would be a statement to the House on that issue.  It was the subject of correspondence from Bruce Arnold among others.  My understanding is that the Government is disposed to change the Irish language version.  Could the Taoiseach outline how the Government got that wrong at the outset, its implications and the need to remedy the wording?</p></speech>

That text was subsequently translated into Gaeilge by the Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n, which is the translation service in the Oireachtas, and included in the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015.  Some questions have been raised publicly regarding the Irish version of the text.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General examined that issue with the support of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n and legal and linguistic experts.  Their view is that the Irish version as produced is robust and encompasses a right to marry for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples.</p>  <p>  The Government, however, does not wish the Irish wording, as opposed to the key question in the referendum, to be the focus of any debate in the referendum campaign and in the interests of ensuring absolute clarity as to the intended effect of the amendment, it decided to amend the Irish wording and replace it with a more literal translation of the English wording.  An Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n has worked on a new wording.  Its recommendation, which the Government accepted, is that the revised Irish wording should be: "F&eacute;adfaidh beirt, gan beann ar a ngn&eacute;as, conradh p&oacute;sta a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir dl&iacute;."  This is a more literal translation of the English wording, which is: &ldquo;Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.&rdquo;  The Minister will introduce the proposed wording as a Committee Stage amendment to the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 tomorrow.  That amendment, if approved by the people, would be inserted into Article 41 of the Constitution as Article 41.4.  No changes are proposed to the existing provisions of that article. </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I do not propose to do that.</p></speech>

In November the inspector of prisons, Mr. Justice Reilly, said:<blockquote>Prisoners forfeit their rights to freedom.  That is all they forfeit.  They are entitled to all other rights and privileges that you and I enjoy.</blockquote>We have 300 prisoners on lockdown for at least 19 hours and some on a 23 hour lockdown.  Some 304 prisoners still have to slop out from their cells and, for a brief time, that included five women who were arrested and imprisoned for non-payment of fines including fines relating to the television licence.  When will the prisons Bill be published to bring the penal regime here into line with human rights and UN practice?</p><p>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said last week that the review of the fair deal system was on the Secretary General's desk.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to provide additional funding each year for the care of older people and it is very clear from the crisis in our hospital system that not only do older people deserve this, it would also assist in freeing up hospital beds.  The Minister said there was a &euro;30 million gap in funding so can we have a definitive timeframe for when this review will be published?  Will the Government allocate time to debate it?</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said the promised insolvency legislation would have to be changed.  He said banks must be forced to engage in insolvency arrangements and the Government had to act.  We all know about the huge increase in people who are subjected to intimidation during repossession actions by the banks and the Government has encouraged this because there is not enough legislative protection.  If the Minister is heralding the fact that he is going to put in protections and take away the veto the Government have given to the banks, that would be a very good move.  When does the Government intend to amend the legislation and will there be Government time to discuss it?</p></speech>

The review of the fair deal is still with the Minister for Health.  There will be time to debate it when he publishes it and I understand that is not too far away.</p>  <p>  I have already answered questions on distressed mortgages today.  This will be the subject of a number of measures being brought forward by Government in April following a review of the personal insolvency agency and a range of other issues that have arisen.  Some 100,000 cases have been settled effectively and satisfactorily but there are 37,000 cases out there where we need to take some further action and Government will deal with that in April, when there will be an opportunity for Members to discuss it.</p></speech>

Last week the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, announced that he would reform the planning laws relating to one-off family homes.  Is this a promise to bring in primary or secondary legislation?  What is the timeline?</p>  <p>  It has been disclosed today that 400 convicted rapists and paedophiles in the UK have gone missing, three of them in Northern Ireland where the PSNI is looking for them.  It is likely that some are in this jurisdiction.  Back in 2009 the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told the House that the failure to modernise our sex offenders' law would lead to Ireland becoming a safe haven for convicted sex offenders.  What is the timeline for the criminal justice (sex offenders) Bill?  In light of the fact that we have already approved Second Stage of the child sex offenders (information and monitoring) Bill, will the Minister fasttrack it through committee so that we can close off at least some of the gaping loopholes in our sex offenders' legislation to protect women, children and vulnerable adults from these sex offenders and any others who have gone AWOL?</p></speech>

I wish to ask about two other pieces of legislation in this area.  Quite a number of people are being threatened with repossession of their homes, many of whom have continuously made the maximum payments they could afford over the past five or six years.  Resolution does not mean the same for everybody as in many cases what appears to be resolution is actually repossession, which means unfortunate people being put out of their homes.  In the context of unregulated third parties who bought distressed loan books, is it possible that a distinction can be made so that they are brought within the rigours of our regulations and so that they do not pursue people on the basis of a quick fix, having bought the loanbook at a reduced rate to capitalise on the unfortunate situation people are in?</p>  <p>   I believe it is necessary to bring banking consolidation Bill before the House as a matter of urgency in this context.</p></speech>

In fact, it can only be done by a member of Government.  I thought it was something that could be done by a member of the Opposition.  As a result, I must raise this by way of Topical Issue, and I am glad to do so.</p>  <p>  It is also disappointing that it proves difficult when one tries to get information on the sums spent on dealing with litter.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister last December to try to ascertain the individual sums spent on removing litter generally and chewing gum from the roads and footpaths in various counties and local authority areas, but that information is not available in the Department as it does not collect detailed information.  I did get an answer, however, from the Minister for 2003, when local authorities spent in excess of &euro;82 million on street-cleaning activities.  This shows there is quite an amount spent on removing litter and chewing gum.</p>  <p>  I am aware also that last year &euro;841,000 was given to local authorities in anti-litter awareness grants.  In fact, the figure for Galway City Council was &euro;33,000 and for Galway County Council, it was &euro;25,500.  Obviously, there is a big issue in dealing with the various types of litter on the streets and footpaths.  The most common types of litter are chewing gum, cigarette butts, fast-food wrappers, plastic bottles, plastic bags and cans.  The litter I am addressing in my few short minutes is chewing gum.  I saw figures for the Dublin city area where there is a real problem with chewing gum being thrown on the streets and footpaths.  In 2013, in the O'Connell Street to Grafton Street area monitored by the Department, &euro;83,000 was spent on removing chewing gum litter in 2013.</p>  <p>  I was hoping a levy would be imposed on manufacturers that would raise funds to remove the litter from public roads and footpaths.  Failing that, I understand that there was to be a meeting of all the major stakeholders - the manufacturers and the local authorities - to come to an arrangement where the manufacturers would contribute towards removing chewing gum.  There was agreement in the past that there would be advertising campaigns but we must do much more than that.  We must get funding from the manufacturers.  The other issue that arose in discussions was the question of a biodegradable product that would ensure we would not have the difficulty in removing such a product.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister can give me some indication of the state of play.  Needless to say, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is the fourth Minister with whom I have raised this issue.  I have not had much success with other Ministers and I hope he might able to give me an update on what is happening at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000031#DD00400"><p>As the fourth Minister, I might give Deputy Kitt a slightly different answer.</p>  <p>  On foot of the success of the plastic bag levy, my Department commissioned a study on the possible extension of environmental levies to other materials that are problematic from a litter perspective.  With regard to chewing gum, the study recommended that either a levy on sales be put in place or that a negotiated agreement be entered into with the sector.</p><p>However, unlike the use of plastic bags, the Government has no desire to curtail the use of chewing gum.  What the Government wants to do is change the attitude and behaviour of those people who see it as acceptable to discard their gum on our streets.  Some of the chewing gum litter we see on our streets is absolutely disgusting.  I do not currently believe that a levy on chewing gum is the appropriate means by which to achieve our aim.  I would stress the word "currently" because this may change.  A levy would penalise both the industry and the consumer and would not provide an incentive to people to alter their behaviour with regard to disposing of gum.  It was therefore decided that a negotiated agreement with the industry was the most appropriate direction to take on this issue.  Such an agreement provides a mechanism for achieving a lasting change in behaviour with regard to the disposal of gum rather than a short-term clean up solution that does not address the underlying problem of the irresponsible disposal of gum.</p> <p> A negotiated agreement has been in place with the chewing gum industry since 2007.  The agreement facilitates a partnership approach through a range of agreed programmes that are practical, robust and targeted to address the root cause of the problem.  As part of this agreement, the chewing gum industry mounted a national media campaign involving outdoor advertising throughout the country, national radio and TV advertising, in-store and around store advertising, as well as a schools' educational campaign promoting greater awareness of the damaging effects of chewing gum litter on our environment and of the penalties associated with the irresponsible disposal of gum.</p> <p> Evidence indicates that the negotiated agreement approach is working.  Since 2008, my Department's national litter pollution monitoring system report demonstrates that the percentage of national litter represented by chewing gum has decreased from 30.79% in 2008 to 15.32% in 2013, a reduction of 50%.  The most recent programme, which ran from 2012 to 2014, has just concluded.  It was funded entirely by the industry and was valued at an estimated &euro;9.6 million.  I have received a further proposal from the industry to renew the negotiated agreement for the term 2015 to 2017, and this matter is under consideration.  I assure Deputy Kitt that while a renewed agreement is under consideration, it is not something that will simply go through on the nod.  It is something that I will consider deeply.  If we feel that we need a change of tack or need to consider levies or any other measures, we will do so.</p></speech>

The figure of 15%, while an improvement, is still high.  This is an important issue because of the cost involved in removing this particular product from our streets.  The problem boils down to the irresponsible disposal of chewing gum.  Like the Minister, I am not trying to stop anyone from using chewing gum; it is the disposal of gum that is the issue.  We have reached a compromise with the industry whereby it is funding an advertising campaign.  However, if this situation continues, I do not envisage seeing any further improvements.</p>  <p>  The Wrigley company has its headquarters in Chicago and, to the best of my knowledge, there is no problem with chewing gum or other litter on the streets of that city.  We must try to get some more help from the industry.  It was proposed in the past to put a levy on the chewing gum itself but that would have hit the consumer unfairly.  It is very regrettable that the industry is not prepared, as I understand it, to contribute towards the cost of removing the gum from our streets.  Will the Minister indicate if any discussions have taken place on the development of a biodegradable product?</p></speech>

The solution that has been put in place, namely, the negotiated agreement, has had a dramatic impact and the statistics prove it.  That said, I agree with the Deputy that the figure that pertains is still of concern.  I will consider whether a further agreement is feasible.  I will examine the contributions that could be made, including whether we can increase the level of funding involved.  I will make a decision then whether we should proceed with another negotiated agreement or go down another avenue entirely, possibly involving the imposition of a levy or some other measure.

In 1899, the service dealt with approximately 520 calls but today it deals with approximately 80,000 incidents annually.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service has an added advantage when attending emergency incidents.  Where necessary, a fire tender or other specialist vehicle may also be deployed to an incident.  Each fire tender has fully trained paramedics who are often the first on `the scene in the case of ECHO or DELTA calls and act as first responders.  In many instances, the fire crews initiate first interventions which aid in reducing time to defibrillation and resuscitation as well as reducing on-scene time and ensuring good patient handling and removal.  Fire crews are particularly good at patient handling. They take a full-team approach at road traffic collisions and are vital in the stabilisation, immobilisation and management of spinal injury patients and their removal to hospital.</p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade has a duty under section 25 of the Fire Services Act to take charge of major or complex incidents.  Its ambulance crews can be deployed in high-risk situations involving chemical, fire or other serious incidents where it may not be possible to deploy other services such as the HSE ambulance service.  In the event of an emergency incident at Dublin Airport or at Dublin Port, for example, the local authority is responsible under the emergency framework for providing fire and rescue services.  The best resource available to provide this incident cover is the Dublin Fire Brigade integrated fire and ambulance service.  Its integrated control room has a pivotal role to play in providing the cover needed for such events.  An added bonus of the combined fire and emergency medical service is the extra equipment available to crews to ensure scene safety and to extract entrapped patients.</p>  <p>  If Dublin Fire Brigade becomes just a fire and non-medical emergency service, vital life-saving services will be lost.  If it loses its ability to dispatch integrated emergency medical services, lives will be put at risk.  Fire services in the United Kingdom are moving towards an integrated service, combining or co-locating fire and emergency medical services.</p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade is contracted to supply 11 ambulances to the Dublin area and handles approximately 80,000 incidents per annum.  The National Ambulance Service is supposed to be the first responder in the Tallaght and Swords areas but it usually does not have an ambulance available for these areas.  The National Ambulance Service regularly does not have an ambulance on duty in certain areas because if crew members are unavailable for any reason, they are not replaced, as was highlighted on "Prime Time" recently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000033#FF00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the proposed changes to Dublin ambulance services.  Historically, the Dublin emergency ambulance service has been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB. The National Ambulance Service, NAS, supports the DFB as required.  However, HIQA published a report last December which identified serious patient safety concerns with regard to the lack of co-ordination between the NAS and the DFB.  The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance.</p>  <p>  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council have agreed in principle to address the identified weaknesses through the provision of a single point of contact for all emergency calls in Dublin.  Under the agreement reached, all 999 and 112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region will be routed through the national emergency operations centre in Tallaght, and all ambulances, regardless of whether they are DFB or NAS, will be dispatched from Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS medical director.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements will mean that people in Dublin will get a better ambulance service that will be safer.  Currently, where the DFB does not have an ambulance available, it may or may not pass the call to the NAS.  Passing calls between call centres is not without risks.  Calls can be delayed or, worse, missed.  The people of Dublin can also look forward to a more responsive service, as all ambulances will be dispatched from Tallaght.  The dispatcher will be able to see every available ambulance in the region.  The nearest available ambulance, regardless of whether it is NAS or DFB, will be sent to the incident.  The clinical governance changes will mean that patients will receive exactly the same level of care no matter which ambulance arrives.</p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns have been expressed in the media about a takeover by the NAS of Dublin ambulance services.  I can assure the House that claims of a takeover are wide of the mark.  The proposed changes will not impact on the delivery of services.  The DFB will continue to provide ambulance services in Dublin.  Only the structures around clinical governance of the service and call management will change.</p>  <p>  The DFB has provided very well for the emergency needs of Dublin since 1898, as the Deputy outlined.  However, no health service can afford to stand still.  A single contact and dispatch point for emergency ambulance calls is needed to address the safety issues raised by HIQA.  I am delighted, therefore, to note that agreement in principle has now been reached with the unions on the integration of emergency ambulance call taking and dispatch.  It has also been agreed that the DFB will continue to be fully involved in emergency ambulance service delivery and there will be no diminution in such services.  I understand that a joint forum within Dublin City Council, which will include management and union representatives, is to be established to address issues regarding the control centre reconfiguration.  That is a very welcome development and will ensure that the people of Dublin get the ambulance service they deserve.</p></speech>

She made reference to delays, which are clearly a resource issue.  It is my understanding that the DFB was allocated one additional ambulance during a period of approximately 20 years.  I may stand corrected, but that is my understanding.  The population has increased and the numbers of calls has increased exponentially without a corresponding increase in required resources.  The broader problem is that while these arguments rage, lives can often be put at risk.  It is my understanding that both the DFB and the NAS are committed to their respective roles.</p>  <p>  I welcome the recent announcement by the Dublin city manager that a forum will be created to discuss these issues.  Many welcomed the statement by the Minister for Health recently in which he committed to discussion on this matter.  It is important to take into account the views of stakeholders, the workforce, service users and, of course, the citizens of Dublin.  These views need to be gauged before any step is taken.</p>  <p>  The truth needs to be made clear.  We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  After all, 80% of DFB ambulance responses are within the HIQA standard of seven minutes and 59 seconds.  We should not overlook that.  It is likely that it is one of the best performers in the country.  The response time, supplemented by the ability to dispatch a fire attender fully staffed by paramedics, is not something we can lightly afford to lose.</p></speech>

One of my sons-in-law works in the fire service in another part of the country.  I know from listening to him and from news reports that there is often a need for both services to attend, depending on the circumstances.  In a major accident, it might be necessary to use equipment that paramedics in an ambulance service would not necessarily have.</p>  <p>  In respect of ambulance time response, be it the DFB or the NAS, I often wonder whether we are setting the bar too high, because there can be circumstances in which ambulances cannot possibly meet the timeframe set for them.  I know that to someone waiting for an ambulance, including someone in a support role, the time taken for the ambulance to arrive can often seem to be an awful lot longer than it is.  We would all like ambulances and the services we require to be there instantly, but that is not always possible.  </p>  <p>  There is a positive outcome to the ongoing discussions within the forum in Dublin City Council.  I believe the need for both services cannot be underestimated, but it is important that these services comply in respect of the safety concerns highlighted by HIQA.  I am not sure whether anyone who has ever waited for an ambulance or any of the emergency services worries about which one of them gets there first, provided someone does get there and those who get there have the competence and training to deliver what the patient needs.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000033#FF00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate.  I am very disappointed to find myself here once again.  This is an issue I have raised on numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It shows how important the issue is for the people of Waterford.  Two years ago, I received a letter from the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, offering certain assurances to the people of Waterford and the south east regarding the health services in Waterford.  This letter came after a winter of discontent in Waterford in which we saw thousands of people take to the streets, having come from all around the south east, to show that they were concerned about a possible downgrading of Waterford Regional Hospital, as it was known then.  Their fear was centred, as it is centred now, around the Higgins report, which examined the reorganisation of hospital groupings.  After a lot of fear, we were promised that this would make things better.  I attended a lot of meetings, and at each of these Professor Higgins promised us time and again that what we had would be protected and services would be enhanced.  We were told this would be a good thing for people in Waterford and the south east.  The letter from the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, said that the establishment of hospital groups would enhance cardiology cover in Waterford.  It went on to say: "[T]he increased flexibility of staff across the group will enable us to achieve our goal of providing cardiology cover at Waterford Regional Hospital 24 hours a day, seven days a week."</p><p>Two years on, we are no closer to that.  Deputy John Halligan, who also represents Waterford, raised the very serious case two weeks ago of a man from Waterford who sadly and tragically died because the service was not available.  A second cath laboratory to provide 24-7 cardiology services is needed.  We were told at the time that we would get it.  I now understand that a business plan is being put together and that this would cost &euro;1.5 million, which is only a small amount in the context of the delivery of health services.  This small amount of money would copperfasten services at University Hospital Waterford, UHW.  We need an around the clock service.  This requires provision of a second cath laboratory and the staff required to keep two laboratories open.  <br/><br/>There are also shortcomings at the hospital in terms of dermatology services.  It is worth noting that the south east has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country.  Currently, there is no consultant dermatologist at University Hospital Waterford.  One consultant is due to return from leave at the end of the month and interviews are taking place to fill other posts.  This means that the people of Waterford now have to travel from the city to the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital in Cork to see a consultant.  I will give an example in this regard.  I was contacted by a distressed family whose mother is 79 years of age and is in a great deal of pain because of a very serious skin condition.  She constantly breaks out in blisters which burst which, as one can imagine, is very painful.  This lady, who is almost 80 years of age, is forced to travel to Cork to see a consultant for a five or ten minute consultation.  This involves a four hour round trip journey for a fragile woman.  It also places extra pressure on her family, who, because there is no transport available, have to take days off work to bring her to Cork, and all for a service that should be available in Waterford.  Dermatology services at University Hospital Waterford have been reduced to one afternoon clinic on a Wednesday.  This is not the vibrant future that was promised to the people of Waterford.  The case I highlighted is only one of the less serious cases.<br/><br/>I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to read last week's <i>Waterford News &amp;amp; Star</i>which outlines a truly awful case of a man who almost died because of a lack of dermatology services in University Hospital Waterford.  A father of two whose skin was red and bubbling arrived in accident and emergency, where he spent 18 hours on a trolley and was misdiagnosed twice.  As the doctors had never before seen the condition, a conscientious nurse faxed photographs of the man's skin to the Cork hospital.  The consultants there took one look at them and advised that the man be sent to Cork immediately.  The irony is that although there was a consultant dermatologist conducting his Wednesday clinic in UHW, the man did not get to see him.  There were no ambulances available to take this extremely sick man to Cork as, he was told, access to the ambulance service required two days notice.  This man, whose life was in danger, was then put in a taxi and sent to the Cork hospital.  When he got there, he was told by the hospital staff that had he spent any more in Waterford hospital he would no longer be with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-10a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031000034#GG00200"><p>I will first address the Deputy's last concern regarding dermatology services.  There are three approved permanent consultant dermatologist posts at UHW.  As rightly pointed out by the Deputy, one consultant is currently on maternity leave but is due to return to work on 25 March.  Interviews to fill the other two posts were held on 25 February and two successful candidates are currently being processed by the national recruitment service.  University Hospital Waterford is optimistic that contracts for these posts can be agreed in the coming months.  I will do as much as I can to ensure this is done as speedily as possible.  I do not propose to repeat what the Deputy said in regard to the special arrangement with the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, Cork, for urgent dermatological referrals.  The two new posts at UHW, when filled, will have a significant impact on services.  I will do my best to ensure the process, including vetting and so on, is completed as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue which I assumed to be in relation to cardiology services in Waterford.  The report on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trusts noted that the cardiology service at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, should be extended.  The hospital's regional cardiology interventional suite opened in 2008.  In 2012, the suite was identified as the designated primary PCI centre for the region, under the national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome.  Its services cover Waterford, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Wexford.  The centre currently has one catheterisation laboratory, which operates five days a week and incorporates a dedicated six-bed cardiac day ward.  Staffing includes three consultant interventional cardiologists based at Waterford and two visiting consultant cardiologists from Wexford and south Tipperary, who work there one day a week.  I understand that a business case, prepared by UHW, for the development of a second catheterisation laboratory and a 24-hour PCI service, is under consideration within the south-south west hospital group.  The development of a second catheterisation laboratory is, I believe, considered a priority within the group. </p>  <p>  In regard to the suggested extension of the PCI service to a 24-hour service, for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding whether a 24-hour service should be provided is whether there is a sufficient volume of appropriate activity to ensure safe provision of the service to patients.  Without sufficient throughput of patients, staff engaged in the service will not be able to maintain their skill levels.  This could put patients at risk.  lt is my understanding that under the acute coronary syndrome programme to be viable, a 24-7 PCI service must serve a population of 500,000 to 1,000,000 people, which requires at least six interventional cardiologists to staff the necessary roster.  It is worth noting that the acute coronary syndrome programme is of the view that the current population base covered by UHW does not provide for a viable 24-7 service.  I am aware that the consultants currently providing the existing service have indicated their willingness to work extra hours to facilitate the extension of the current nine-to-five service, and I welcome their commitment.  However, this would also require the provision of additional specialist support services provided by radiographers, nurses and cardiac technicians, with considerable additional revenue costs.  I take on board what the Deputy had to say in relation to the extra cost.  A review of PCI services in Dublin is due to be completed shortly.  On completion of that process, PCI capacity and requirements in areas outside Dublin, including Waterford, will be examined.  Any decision on further provision of PCI services in any region will be based on the best interest of patients, evidence on the volume of clinical need, the quality and safety of the service that can be provided, the ability to staff it safely and the resources available.</p>  <p>  I know that my response in relation to additional cost is cold comfort to the Deputy.  I will find out exactly what is the additional cost.  It is hoped that following the review of the PCI services we will be able to progress the case highlighted on numerous occasions by the Deputy.  It is not that we are ignoring it.  Patient safety is paramount.  When the Deputy highlights cases of people having died for lack of a service that must also be taken into consideration. </p></speech>

I take no pleasure in raising this issue time and again.  I represent the people of Waterford, who feel like they are getting a shoddy deal.  We were told at the time of the Higgins' report that one of the main requirements to secure services into the future was an increased population base.  In regard to the case I highlighted of the elderly woman having to attend the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital in Cork for a dermatology service, I was told on numerous occasions by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that the consultants would travel to Waterford, because that makes more sense than frail sick people having to make a four-hour journey in great discomfort to avail of a service they are entitled to receive on their own doorstep.  We were told that with the birth of these new hospital groups we would be able to attract the calibre of consultant that requires a big population base to ensure his or her skill set is maintained.</p><p>We were assured that through the provision of services in Cork, Waterford and in the other hospitals that they would have the necessary throughput of patients to maintain their skill set to a high standard in order that they could give the best service to the people of the south east.  We were promised professorships and academic posts.  Could the Minister of State please indicate the current position in that regard?  I would welcome an update on the partnership between University Hospital Waterford and University College Cork, UCC.  To be honest, the current situation is just not good enough.  The hospital is called "University Hospital Waterford", which sounds good but it means nothing.  We do not have what we were promised.  I understand we are in a time of limited resources but as the economy starts to improve, the Labour Party must focus on the provision of public services.  I will fight tooth and nail to ensure the people of Waterford and the south east get what they deserve.  As a party in government we must make real decisions about where we want to provide investment.  I, for one, will support investment in public services.  Currently, nurses, doctors and care assistants are currently working to the pin of their collar to ensure service provision in University Hospital Waterford, but they need the Minister's support and that of his Cabinet colleagues to ensure we get the services that are so badly required in Waterford and the south east.</p></speech>

Inasmuch as I can, I will do my very best to ensure the national recruitment service expedites those two appointments.</p>  <p>  I will keep an eye on the business plan that is being prepared in regard to the catheterisation laboratories.  Deputy Conway is correct in that when the hospital groups were being considered the reason Wexford, Kilkenny and all of the other areas were brought together was to provide the required population base, because it is important that consultants in particular specialties have the required throughput on an ongoing and continuous basis, as that is what makes them expert in their field.  The people delivering the service in Waterford at the moment are doing an incredible job.  The unfortunate difficulty is that they are not there for long enough and they are not there at weekends.  As Deputy Conway correctly pointed out, as the economy improves we will have to examine the issues that directly affect people.</p></speech>

That is a total of nine people.  The general manager outlined in the reply that the waiting lists for spinal surgery is one the priorities of the Saolta University Health Care Group.  He further outlined that a number of arrangements are being put in place to facilitate the level of complexity involved in relation to spinal surgery for patients with scoliosis and that the group is currently reviewing a number of resources in the context of bed availability, access to diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre.  He stated that when the key elements required are in place, potential surgery dates for the cohort of patients can be identified and scheduled accordingly.</p>  <p>  The patients who contacted me have not received any date whatsoever and they are still waiting.  I will not name them although they said it would not be a problem if I wanted to name them.  They live in Mayo and Roscommon.  A surgeon dealing with one of the cases raised a serious situation in September.  He said that the patient in question was one of approximately 40 under his direct care who require major, complex spinal surgery at the Galway University Hospitals.  He said she had been placed on a waiting list for the surgery to take place and that the rods were taken out of her back in September due to infection and she is now waiting to have the rods replaced.  Surgery is required when the curvature level reaches 50% and the curvature of the patient in question is 70%.  The surgeon indicated that in the current context of the allocation to him, he does not envisage the operation taking place for the foreseeable future.  He said it was the case up to approximately two to three years ago that he could perform that type of surgery at Merlin Park University Hospital and had been doing that regularly since 1996.  However, as a result of the withdrawal of support services for this type of surgery, the only place capable of providing it on the western seaboard was in University Hospital Galway.  With the management team he set about trying to structure a pathway that would allow that to happen, but it has not happened in a seamless, safe way to date.  As a result, he could not advise the patient of a definite time or date for the operation to take place.  It seems that operations were to go ahead in University Hospital Galway but the team has not been put in place to carry them out.  It is not good enough for patients to wait so long for urgent surgery, in particular when one patient has a curvature of more than 70%.</p></speech>

All Members are dealing with at least one or two cases of people with scoliosis who are encountering difficulties.  Waiting times for scoliosis surgery are unacceptably long.  There has been an increase in the number of outpatient spinal review referrals, and a consequent increase in surgical demands.  Hence, waiting times both for outpatients and for those awaiting surgery are indeed challenging.  The Government is determined that this problem will be addressed.  The HSE is examining all options to reduce scoliosis and other waiting lists as soon as possible.  It must be pointed out that Galway University Hospitals do not carry out paediatric scoliosis surgery.  That type of surgery may only be carried out at Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Cappagh hospitals and is predominantly managed at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  Approximately 5% of cases, predominantly those with neuromuscular disorders, will require post-operative access to a high dependency unit or paediatric intensive care unit.  Surgery is provided through two full-day theatre sessions per week and ten specialist orthopaedic beds at Crumlin.  Currently, there are two orthopaedic consultants jointly appointed between Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals to provide paediatric spinal surgery in Crumlin and paediatric, adolescent and adult spinal services at Tallaght hospital.</p>  <p>  Saolta University Health Care Group has assured the Department of Health that the waiting list for spinal surgery is one of its main priorities.  To facilitate the level of complexity involved in relation to spinal surgery for patients with scoliosis, access to inpatient beds, diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre for significant periods of time must be considered.  When the key elements required are in place, potential surgery dates for this cohort of patients can be identified and scheduled accordingly.  Funding has been allocated in the 2015 HSE service plan for the appointment of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in spinal surgery at Galway University Hospitals.  Funding has also been allocated for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  This will maximise the use of available theatre sessions in the hospital.  These allocations are part of a total of approximately &euro;5 million available for the overall development of orthopaedic service infrastructure nationally in 2015.  This funding will also allow for the development of a 24-7 spinal theatre and allocation of consultant anaesthetist and additional 5.5 nurse posts at the Mater hospital, the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon to provide for up to 100 cases of degenerative spinal surgery a year to be undertaken in Tallaght hospital, the appointment of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in paediatrics in Cork, the opening of current closed and under-utilised capacity at Cappagh hospital, and the appointment of an additional orthopaedic consultant as part of improved services for paediatric spina bifida.</p><p>The Department will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to ensure service needs and waiting times in this area are addressed, having regard to the overall level of resources available to the HSE. </p></speech>

One patient has been waiting for surgery since July 2014, when an infection caused her to have an operation done to remove rods from her back.  She has not been given a date for surgery, and we have been informed that the reason for the delay is the lack of beds for post-operative care.  It is unacceptable that patients with curvature exceeding 70 degrees are waiting for surgery.</p>  <p>  According to a reply I received from the Minister, a number of cases involving children were transferred to the Blackrock Clinic.  While it goes against the grain for me to advocate private care, in emergencies such as these, the use of alternative facilities, including private hospitals, should be considered.  I am aware that consideration is being given to having these patients treated in Cappagh Hospital.  The two people to whom I referred are serious and urgent cases.  I do not understand the reason an alternative has not been provided for them on the basis that their cases are emergencies.</p></speech>

Despite the additional capacity to be provided this year, the number of surgeries at Crumlin hospital will still fall short of what is required to deal with demand.  The Health Service Executive is working with Crumlin Hospital and the children's hospital group to explore all options to increase capacity for spinal surgery.</p>  <p>  The Deputy and I both understand that a structure for emergency surgery cannot be easily put in place, even if cases involving persons with a curvature of 70 degrees cannot be delayed any longer.  The issue is much more serious.  The new consultant posts in Galway and Cork and the opening of beds in Cappagh Hospital will contribute to addressing the problem, as will the provision of additional support staff such as nurses and anaesthetists.  Given the type of surgery involved, which takes a long time, the role of the anaesthetist is as important as that of the surgeon.  We are not dismissing this issue and we know full well how important and urgent it is.  I hope considerable improvements will be made in the next few months.</p></speech>

The Bill sets out the wording of the thirty-fourth amendment that will be put to the people in a referendum on 22 May 2015.  The referendum will be on the question of marriage equality.  The people will have the opportunity in the referendum to consider whether the Constitution should be amended so as to allow couples to marry without distinction as to their sex.  The referendum is exclusively about civil marriage and the consequences that flow from civil marriage for the two persons choosing to get married to one another.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed on 5 November 2013 that a referendum should be held in the first half of 2015 on the question of enabling same-sex couples to marry.  The Government's decision was in response to the report of the Convention on the Constitution.  The convention's third report, Amending the Constitution to Provide for Same-sex Marriage, issued in June 2013, recommended that a change be made to the Constitution to provide for same-sex marriage.  As Deputies will be aware, the convention sought submissions from interested parties and received 1,077 submissions from interest groups, church organisations and private individuals.  It held a plenary debate on this question on 13 and 14 April 2013.  The outcome of its deliberations was that a strong majority of its members recommended that provision be made for same-sex marriage. </p>  <p>  The Government noted the third report of the Convention on the Constitution when taking its decision to hold a referendum on this issue.  It also noted the high level of engagement of the members in the process and the strong interest of civil society in this issue, as reflected in the large number of submissions, and the high level of support within the convention for the recommendation to change the Constitution to enable same-sex couples to marry.</p>  <p>  The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 was published on 21 January 2015, following Government agreement on the proposed wording that day.  The Government has since agreed, on 3 March 2015, the general scheme of the marriage Bill 2015, which sets out the legislative changes that will be undertaken if the referendum is passed by the people.</p>  <p>  The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 provides that, if the referendum is passed, a new section would be inserted after section 3 of Article 41 of the Constitution.  If approved by the people, this section, which would be Article 41.4, would contain the following wording: "Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex."  No other amendments would arise in respect of Article 41.  The wording is intended to give a right to marry to couples without distinction as to their sex.  If the wording is approved by the people, there would be a corresponding obligation and requirement on the State to respect and vindicate that right in its legislation.  Therefore, it would not be open to the State to maintain in being legislation which prohibits the marriage of same-sex couples.</p>  <p>  I propose to outline the rationale behind the wording proposed for the thirty-fourth amendment.  The first element, "Marriage may be contracted", draws on the precedent of Article 41, which recognises marriage as an institution.  The proposed wording seeks to convey that marriage is an institution which two persons may enter.  The decision to use the term "contracted" was taken for the following reasons.  It is the term already used in Article 41.3 in respect of marriage.  Furthermore, the term confirms that what is at issue is civil marriage, which is a contract between two persons in the eyes of the State.</p>  <p>  The phrase "in accordance with law" has been included in the proposed wording to confirm that marriage would continue, as at present, to be regulated by statute and common law.  The manner in which marriage ceremonies are registered, for instance, would be regulated by statute. </p>  <p>  The phrase "without distinction as to their sex" reflects language already used in Article 16 of the Constitution.  Articles 16.1 and 16.2 use the phrase "without distinction of sex" with regard to the eligibility of citizens for membership of the D&aacute;il and the right of every citizen to vote for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The wording proposed for the thirty-fourth amendment builds on the language of that precedent to provide for a couple, regardless of their sex, to be eligible to marry.</p>  <p>  There has been some commentary on the decision to use the term "sex" in the wording of the proposed amendment.  The reason it has been used is that it is the term already used in the Constitution.  Furthermore, the barriers which prevent persons from marrying under Irish law are impediments relating to a person's sex rather than a person's gender.</p>  <p>  If the referendum is passed by the people, the right to marriage equality will be enshrined in the Constitution and Ireland will advance along the path to marriage equality which has already been taken by many countries.  An increasing number of countries are giving same-sex couples the right to marry.  The Netherlands was the first country to pass a law in 2001 enabling same-sex couples to marry.</p><p>Since then, Belgium, Spain, Canada, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, France, Brazil, Uruguay, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Finland, England, Wales and Scotland have all given same-sex couples the right to marry.  It is possible for same-sex couples to marry in 37 US states.  The US Supreme Court is currently considering whether that right should be extended throughout all US states.  Only last week, the Slovenian Parliament approved a law in favour of marriage equality.  More and more countries of the world are recognising that couples should have the right to marry one another regardless of their sexual orientation.<br/><br/>At issue is the question of who should have the right to marry.  The referendum would not, if passed, redefine marriage.  Marriage would not change if same-sex couples were given the right to marry.  Couples would continue to marry in exactly the same way and according to the same conditions as at present.  The manner in which marriages are registered would continue to be regulated by law.  The effects of marriage on property, taxation and succession would be unchanged.  The people will have to decide on a simple question: whether marriage is open to all couples who wish to enter it.<br/><br/>Marriage is an institution that we hold dear in Ireland.  It is enshrined in our Constitution as an institution that the State is pledged to guard with special care.  According to census 2011, there were 1,708,604 persons married in Ireland, representing an increase of 143,588 since 2006.  EUROSTAT statistics for 2012 confirm that Ireland has the lowest divorce rate in the EU at 0.6 per 1,000 of the population.  If marriage is so important to us and if it is the means by which we make a profound commitment to the people that we love, why should it be for some and not others?  What right do we have to say to some couples that they cannot participate in an institution that is the bedrock for so many people?  What right do we have to say to taxpayers, neighbours and citizens that they can live among us but cannot share in all that many hold dear?  I believe if we value marriage as significantly as we do, then we should be ready to share it with all who wish to avail of it.  In fact, it is a tribute to the importance of marriage as the expression of a couple's commitment to one another that same-sex couples wish to be able to marry too.  Enabling same-sex couples to marry reflects the solidity of the institution of marriage.<br/><br/>One myth often put forward in the debate on marriage equality is that the concept of marriage is eternal and unchanging.  However, history shows us that the legal consequences of marriage have changed repeatedly over the centuries.  For example, let us reflect on what marriage meant for women until the 19th century.  Marriage in the past was often a relationship of inequality.  We expect nowadays that our marriages are founded on equality.  However, modern-day marriage is itself the product of a long journey to equality.  The journey to equality follows a familiar path.  Some are often outraged that others should seek equality.  Some fight firmly to defend the <i>status quo</i>.  It is striking that when equality is granted, it becomes inconceivable in the society that it was ever resisted.  Some 43 years ago the marriage bar was still in place, preventing married women in many areas of the public sector from remaining in employment.  It was as late as 1973 when the marriage bar was lifted.<br/><br/>I wish to make one thing clear: it is my belief that enabling same-sex couples to get married would not affect the marriages of heterosexual couples.  They would continue to get married in the same way as currently.  Furthermore, the referendum would not change in any way the rights of religious denominations to decide who should get married in their denominations.  There are constitutional guarantees that protect the rights of religious denominations.  Article 44 of the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion.  Article 44.5 enshrines the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs.<br/><br/>The Government has approved the general scheme of the marriage Bill 2015.  The general scheme outlines the legislative changes that are planned by the Government to give effect to the right to marriage equality anticipated in the constitutional amendment.  I emphasise that the general scheme is conditional on the decision of the electorate on the referendum.  Yesterday, I circulated Members of both Houses with the draft scheme of a marriage Bill which would be introduced by the Government if the referendum is passed by the people.<br/><br/>The Irish wording of the amendment has been subject to some comment.  The Oireachtas translation service is confident that these concerns are unfounded and that the wording, as originally published, clearly allows opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples to marry.  However, the Government considers it important that the electorate should have absolute confidence in the wording proposed for the amendment in English and Irish.  As a result, the Government has decided to propose a more literal translation of the English wording.  I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in this regard.  The amendment will propose the following wording for the amendment in Irish: F&eacute;adfaidh beirt, gan beann ar a ngn&eacute;as, conradh p&oacute;sta a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir dl&iacute;.  This wording can be essentially translated into English as: Two persons, regardless of their sex, can contract a marriage in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Today is a historic day.  Today, the Oireachtas begins the process of debating the legislation that will prepare for the referendum.  The people are getting the opportunity to determine a simple question: do we give a right to marriage equality to all couples who wish to marry in our society?  Do we say that one couple's love is as valid as another's?  Do we say that couples wishing to make a lifelong commitment to one another should have the right to constitutional protection?  I am honoured to introduce this referendum Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The proposed legislation represents another step forward for equality in Ireland as a country which is proud to call itself a republic.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill to allow for the marriage equality referendum to take place on 22 May 2015.  The referendum simply proposes to add to the Constitution the declaration: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.</p>  <p>  Following a meeting with the Minister for Justice and Equality this afternoon, I understand that the Irish language version of this text must now be changed due to an uncertainty surrounding the wording of the first official language version.  While I welcome the clarity that this will bring, the fact that the Minister was willing to acknowledge the possible uncertainty and to act on that, I believe it is an unfortunate incident.  If it were not for the eminent journalist Bruce Arnold, his writings and his raising this matter with my office and that of my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, this issue might not have been addressed.  None the less, my party will fully support the amendments on Committee Stage to correct and clarify the first official language version of the text.</p>  <p>  For my party the upcoming referendum is a question of equality and the question of whether, as a society, we believe that those in gay relationships should be afforded the same security and respect as those in heterosexual relationships.  Our answer to that question is, "Yes" and that all our citizens must be equal before the law.  At my party's Ard-Fheis held in March 2012 our members debated and then voted to pass a resolution supporting equal marriage rights.  The party position is that we support that most basic republican proposition: the entitlement to equality on the part of every citizen.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Fianna F&aacute;il has played a leading role in legislating for key issues in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community guided by the fundamental principle of equality among citizens.  From the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in 1993 to the Civil Partnership Act of 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments led the legislative change.  This legislation is a natural outcome of the years of progress which have been made thus far.</p>  <p>  I commend the Government and the Minister on finally bringing this matter to the House.  I hope the unity of purpose we see in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today will be reflected in the campaign to bring about a "Yes" vote on 22 May next.</p><p> Although this legislation is welcomed by the vast majority of the elected Members of this House, it is important not to take the people's choice in this referendum for granted.  There are serious challenges out there, as there always are in referendums, in convincing 50% plus one to back this proposal.  The polls tell us this referendum is safe but we must not take victory in the campaign for granted.</p> <p> One of the first matters which must be clarified is what this referendum is not about.  This referendum is about allowing a couple of the same sex declare their love and commitment to spending the rest of their time together in a civil marriage.  This referendum is not about adoption, it is not about surrogacy and it is not about other family relationships in law.  These issues are being dealt with by the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 which is currently passing through the Oireachtas.  The referendum will simply ask whether two adults, regardless of their gender, should be able have a civil marriage.</p> <p> It is vital that these facts are communicated to the citizens of this country in an effective and simple manner.  In that regard, I hope the Referendum Commission established for this referendum is given the necessary resources and communicative skills to properly engage with the public.  The "No" side in this referendum campaign will thrive on misinformation and scaremongering.  It is important to point out that we must respect alternative views in this referendum but we must also seek to outline the facts as they are.  We must be clear that civil marriage is a legally binding contract which is regulated and recognised by the State.  The proposed amendment deals with civil marriage rather than marriage through a religious ceremony.  Civil marriage is protected by but not defined in the Constitution.  This proposed constitutional change will not force religions of any kind to carry out marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.  This is a vital distinction which must be made during the campaign.</p> <p> Another significant challenge in this referendum campaign will be voter turnout.  In this regard, the Friday voting is welcome as it will give students an opportunity to travel home to vote.  However, there is important work to be done to ensure that people are aware of the date of the referendum well in advance, that a "register to vote" campaign is carried out as part of the referendum campaign and that polling booths are open for a significant period of time on the day in question.</p> <p> Looking at the specific constitutional amendment, I welcome the simple approach taken by the Minister which will involve the insertion of an extra section into Article 41 of the Constitution.  The section to be, Article 41.4, coming at the end of the provisions on marriage of that article, makes sense.  The fact that no change is proposed to the existing constitutional provisions on marriage is also welcome and reaffirms the importance this State puts on the family unit overall.  In fact, if anything, this referendum shows the strength of the institution of marriage into the 21st century.  It is a welcome development that people are seeking to broaden the ability of our people to enter marriage.  As the Minister has outlined, if the wording and the amended Irish version of the amendment are approved by the people, the establishment of the right of two persons to marry without distinction as to their sex implies a corresponding obligation and requirement on the State to respect and vindicate that right in its legislation.  Therefore, it would not be open to the State to maintain in being legislation which prohibits the marriage of same-sex couples.</p> <p> Looking at developments across the world, as of 1 January 2015, some 17 countries - Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay and the United Kingdom, except for Northern Ireland - and certain sub-national jurisdictions around the world, such as parts of Mexico and most states of the United States, allow same-sex couples to marry.  Ireland's referendum vote is significant as it is the first time any country has held a referendum to permit marriage equality.  There is significant variation across the EU on marriage equality legislation.  Ten EU countries permit marriage equality: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with the exception of Northern Ireland.  Spain became the first predominantly Roman Catholic country to allow same-sex marriage in 2005 when it amended its civil code despite significant opposition from various sectors of society.  Seven EU countries - Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Slovenia - have legislated for civil partnerships, while 11 countries - Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia - forbid same-sex unions.</p> <p> In general, the past several years have seen great progress in the development of anti-discriminatory laws for LGBT citizens across Europe.  There is a notable East-West divide on the subject of same-sex marriage.  Generally speaking, same-sex marriage is more widely accepted in western Europe than in central and eastern Europe and the candidate countries.  Recent developments reflect this.  Some western European member states have made proposals towards, or brought into existence, legislation legalising same-sex marriage, while some central European countries have actually made moves in the opposite direction.  Ireland can be proud of our record thus far in seeking legislative change and particularly in bringing this matter before the people.  Although we are not outliers in the provision of same-sex marriage, we are confirming our country's status as a tolerant, open and inclusive place where difference does not mean division.</p> <p> In conclusion, I want to reiterate my party's full support for this legislation, which will be amended on Committee Stage, and for the subsequent referendum.  We will be campaigning strongly for the passing of this referendum by the people of Ireland.  The work must begin now to win this campaign.  We cannot take anything for granted and we must campaign hard to win.  I hope all of my colleagues here will join with me in committing to running a positive, energetic and informative campaign.</p></speech>

It has been a long road and it is much overdue, but it is great to finally have it here before us.  The starting point for Sinn F&eacute;in on all issues of human and civil rights and equality is the Proclamation of 1916.  It may be almost 100 years old but it is the mission statement for every generation of Irish citizens.  As an Irish republican party, equality is at the core of all that Sinn F&eacute;in represents.  All citizens must enjoy full equality of rights and opportunities under law, regardless of their background, including sexual orientation or gender.  Nothing less can be tolerated in a modern, progressive and inclusive society.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that societal attitudes, the ban on the donation of blood, gender recognition, adoption, transphobic and homophobic bullying, the reporting of domestic and sexual violence, as well as marriage and employment equality, are a few of the areas of life where LGBT people suffer inequality and isolation.  LGBT people suffer higher rates of depression, self-harm and suicide, directly attributable to social conditioning, the stigma and isolation of the historical and, unfortunately, State-led criminalisation, discrimination and harassment.  Of course, that is not unique to Ireland and has, sadly, been the history of states throughout the world.</p>  <p>  I hope that, some day, Ireland will stand as a beacon of LGBT equality and that we will cherish, protect and celebrate the diversity of all of our citizens.  The Bill before us today takes us a step closer to that vision.  I am heartened to see Ireland edge closer to ensuring all of its citizens are equal.  In 2015, it is simply unacceptable that the law does not treat each person equally.  However, I am hopeful that we are on our way there.</p>  <p>  As a proud republican, I strive for equality every day.</p><p>Republicanism is not unique to Sinn F&eacute;in.  It exists across our people and in every political party.  We believe in a real republic where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, religious belief, sexual orientation, where they live and what they do.  To only offer same-sex couples civil partnership is to only offer them a second-class right.  This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in Ireland in 2015.  </p> <p> The time has come for full marriage equality for all.  Put very simply, this is a human rights and equality issue.  Loving, committed relationships between two consenting adults should be treated equally, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.  All couples, same-sex or otherwise, should be allowed to share the same responsibilities, obligations and respect that marriage provides.  This should be enshrined in the Constitution.  Same-sex couples and their children are families just like any other, but these families currently do not have the same legal rights and protection that are available to other families in the State.  This is wrong.</p> <p> We now have the chance to ensure that same-sex couples are no longer treated as second class citizens in our State.  It is an exciting opportunity for us to have a chance to change all of this.  What better way to celebrate 1916 than by enshrining rights of equality within the Constitution, which is our primary law and the people's law?  Approaching the centenary of the 1916 Rising, Sinn F&eacute;in aims not only to commemorate the revolution but to achieve one of its most noble aspirations, that of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</p> <p> We are serious about this.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always campaigned on issues that can bring about positive change for all the people living on this island, and for that precise reason we will be actively campaigning for a "Yes" vote in the upcoming referendum.  This May the Irish people have an exciting opportunity to say that we value all of our relationships equally.  My party is proud to support this referendum and we ask the Irish people to vote "Yes" to civil marriage equality.  A "Yes" vote would send a powerful message to couples who have waited their entire lives to legally mark their love for one another.  We also need to make it clear to all young people who are having difficulty coming to terms with their sexuality and struggling to deal with it that we support them and that their choices are as legitimate as the ones that every single person around them, straight or gay, is making.  This referendum was called by the citizens at a Constitutional Convention.  This is the people's referendum.</p> <p> Civil marriage equality is about protecting our families, neighbours and friends.  It is about two people making a commitment to share in the ups and the downs of life.  Lesbian and gay people are not alone in their demand for full equality of rights and opportunities, regardless of sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity or background.  My party wants everyone on this island to have the same opportunity no matter who we are, what we look like, where we are from or whom we love.  </p> <p> On 22 May we, the Irish people, should take pride in entering the ballot box to extend equality to our neighbours, friends, colleagues or family members.  Irish people are being given a chance to create an Ireland where our citizens are valued equally.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for first-time voters and the established electorate to end the discrimination that many lesbian and gay people living in Ireland continue to experience.</p> <p> Marriage is important to Irish society.  It is a secure foundation for committed and loving couples.  Everyone should be free to marry on those terms.  A "Yes" in this referendum is a yes to lesbian and gay people being full participants in Irish society and fully equal in the eyes of their fellow citizens.</p></speech>

Homosexuality is still a crime in almost 80 countries.  In five of these, and in parts of two others, homosexuality is still punishable by the death penalty.  A further 70 imprison citizens because of their sexual orientation.  Recent years have seen some countries, such as India, strengthening existing penalties.  Even where homosexuality is legal, many countries treat those in same-sex relationships differently, such as having an unequal age of consent or a ban on marriage altogether.  Russia's ban on the promotion of non-traditional sexuality is one example of many.</p>  <p>  As many speakers have said, Ireland has come a long way since it decriminalised same-sex relationships in 1993, which encouraged new generations of lesbian and gay people to live their lives more openly.  I would like to pay tribute and give credit to the work of Senator David Norris, who brought respect into this meaningful debate and has been a strong campaigner throughout Europe and the world for the rights of gay people.   </p>  <p>  The Bill is a further step on the road towards a more liberal and equal Irish society.  By bringing it forward, the Government is sending out a clear message to the world that we want to eliminate discrimination against thousands of our citizens.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed, but not at all surprised, at the attempts to link marriage equality with having children.  Gay parents already exist in this country and neither this Bill nor the ensuing referendum will give them additional parental rights if passed.  What concerns me is that these attempts to frame the "No" argument around family rights could be quite upsetting to children in so-called non-traditional families.  No child should be made feel that his or her family is of lesser value than anyone else's.  </p>  <p>  As I see it, there is no logical argument against supporting this Bill.  We, as legislators, have no place denying two adults in a loving relationship the right to get married.  The argument about whether people are married in the eyes of the Catholic Church, for example, has no place in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Secular law is not beholden to theological discussion in this country any more, and Deputies must leave their personal beliefs and values at the door.  It is important to state this because the Catholic Church will come out against this and perhaps attempt to influence how people should vote.  </p>  <p>  We in the House are not asking the Church to change its position.  Rather, we are attempting to change civil law to give a section of our people civil rights previously denied to them.  We are attempting to give gay people the legal recognition of their relationships and the same dignity and respect that is accorded to opposite-sex couples.  Without that legal recognition, gay partners have been denied hospital visitation rights.  In the event of a partner dying, they have been denied the right to bury their life partners, have been excluded from funerals and have lost their homes because estranged families have come forward to inherit the properties of the deceased.  We cannot allow this to continue.  </p>  <p>  There is always a danger that some voters will use a referendum to pursue an anti-Government agenda, regardless of the issue at hand.  I have been getting some feedback, as many of us have, on social media and within my constituency, that there are people who intend to vote "No" in the upcoming referendum simply as a protest vote to the Government.  That is a horrific prospect.  This Bill and the upcoming referendum will affect the lives of thousands of gay people, who are our people, in Ireland.  Voters will be doing them a serious injustice if they attempt to use the referendum as an opportunity to vent their anger over austerity policies or because they do not like the Government or some section of it.  In the coming weeks, I would urge every Deputy on the Opposition benches to reiterate the point that this is not an election.  Voters will have their day next year to show the Government what they think of austerity or whatever.  For now, the focus must be on gay people being given the same recognition and protection as everyone else.</p></speech>

I will vote &quot;Yes&quot; on 22 May.</p><p>Most people who will vote in the forthcoming referendum will not be personally impacted by the vote.  However, it is well understood by most people that it collectively has an impact on us in that it is an act of social solidarity that will change the laws in order for us to become more equal and inclusive.  Since the foundation of the State, we have tended to outsource social issues to religious institutions as though we were best guided by such bodies.  Changing that has been hugely problematic, as there was a blurring of lines between church and State which is difficult to untangle.  In this instance, it extends to highlighting the difference between civil and religious marriage.</p> <p> Only in recent decades have we got to grips with issues that are more properly located in the area of civic morality.  That is strange, given that we are very proud to declare that we live in a republic.  Civic morality is underpinned by values such as equality, acceptance and freedom, all of which are part of the building blocks towards a better society.  Many of the public debates on the issues surrounding the eighth amendment, for example, or the right to travel and information in this respect, along with the two divorce referendums, were framed by people who took absolute positions on either side.  They were very difficult campaigns.  For example, I remember being in the count centre on the day the first divorce referendum was lost, and the effect it had on those who were directly affected was absolutely awful.  They wanted a second chance and their relationships to be accepted.  It was a personal matter for such people and they were badly bruised by the campaign and its outcome.  Both personal and societal damage was done at that time, and we want to ensure that on 23 May, we will not have a repeat of that.</p> <p> The Minister highlighted a difference in this issue in that it emerged from the Constitutional Convention and this referendum was recommended by it.  The civic ownership of the campaign is beginning to emerge, and the Vote with Us campaign, for example, is a manifestation of it.  The campaign facilitates people telling their story as to why people should vote "Yes", and already it is evident that it features people from all sectors of society.  Brighid and Paddy are a couple who were highlighted at the weekend and will be married for 50 years in 2015.  They made a point of describing themselves as being Roman Catholic.  They argue that this is a civil right that they want for their children and grandchildren.  Mothers and fathers are talking about sons and daughters.  There are straight and gay people involved with the campaign, which is cross-generational and compelling in its ordinariness.  People who have never engaged with politics have come forward to campaign for a "Yes" vote, which is really important.  There is no point in wanting a more equal society but staying at home on 22 May.  It is essential that people come out to vote, and it is essential that ownership of the campaign is portrayed in way that citizens can engage with it.</p> <p> Most people want to live and let live and they are not keen on a nanny state.  Nevertheless, they want to develop our laws in a way that allows people maximum freedom to live their lives.  That is what this referendum is seeking to achieve.  Civil partnership has been advanced and it delivered rights but fewer of them.  For example, there has been no recognition of the rights of same-sex couples for many social supports in cases of hardship.  This can quite literally leave loved ones out in the cold.  A home of people in a civil partnership is described as a shared home rather than a family home, and there are implications for the protection of dependant children, for example, living in the home.  There is also a lack of protection for civil partners who are deserted.</p> <p> It could not be simpler in the case of a civil marriage vote; if we legalise marriage for gay and lesbian citizens, they will be free to get married, although it will not be compulsory.  For many people, Ireland will simply be a happier place.  In a post-crash Ireland, I cannot think of a better way of building civic morality that is grounded in the long-held Irish values of fairness and compassion than by voting "Yes" on 22 May.  Better still, we will become the first country in the world to do this by popular vote.  We will join the 18 nations and 820 million people who have already done it.  The only issue to concern us is complacency, as we all need to get out and be active in this campaign.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill and strongly support it as it is another step towards marriage equality and the construction of a new Ireland built on equality and inclusive politics.  Above all, it is about respecting our citizens.  There can be no ifs or buts and there can be no hint of tolerating discrimination.  One either believes in equality and respect for a person or one does not.  That is the bottom line.  I urge everyone to vote "Yes" in the referendum in May.  Before people vote, I urge all involved in the debate to look at the facts and get active in the debate and campaign.  I know there is cross-party support for the legislation, which is very positive.</p>  <p>  As I have stated before, we need to examine the facts.  We heard misinformation from bishops today and yesterday, which is disappointing.  We must debate with the people involved and tackle the issues head-on.  A couple of years ago I had the privilege of meeting a same-sex couple and their two daughters in my clinic.  The parents did not make the case at that time but rather the children, and they were very impressive.  They spoke about equality and different sorts of families.  The issue concerned the enjoyment of diversity and difference.  That is the kind of country I want to live in.  There were 4,042 same-sex couples living together in 2011, of which 2,321 or 57.4% were male, with 1,721, or 42.6%, were female.  These numbers increased substantially between 2006 and 2011, when the 4,042 same-sex couples recorded as living together indicated an increase of 93% over a five-year period.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this legislation is to amend the Constitution so as to provide that persons may marry without distinction as to their sex.  If the amendment is approved at a referendum of the people, same-sex couples will have the right to marry.  Marriage will continue to be regulated by legislation and the common law.  The wording in the legislation states that marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.  Civil marriage should be open to all citizens, regardless of sex.  Same-sex civil marriage gives equal protection to families with children headed by same-sex couples.  Marriage is not just about having children, and I wish the bishops would recognise that.  If there are no children, a same-sex marriage is no less valid.</p>  <p>  Civil partnership is not the same as marriage; that is a separate and unequal relationship only available to same-sex couples.  We need to highlight that as well.  Without marriage, children in same-sex families will not benefit from the same constitutional protection and status as is afforded to other children.  That is another key point in the debate.  There are many family types in contemporary Ireland today, and families with same-sex parents are just one of these.  Civil marriage is not a religious ceremony but rather a contract between two people who decide to spend their lives together.  In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage has been introduced, marriage has not changed or been damaged, and there no fewer marriages taking place than before.</p></speech>
