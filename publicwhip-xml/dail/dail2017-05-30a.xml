Nowhere are they to be seen more than in the damning report issued yesterday by Professor Geoffrey Shannon, special rapporteur to the Government on child protection.  It is a report that calls into question the commitment of the Government to fulfil its constitutional obligations in the protection of children.</p><p>The Taoiseach will recall that in 2012 the Government held a referendum on the protection of children's rights, whereby the State recognises and affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, protect and vindicate those rights".  However, yesterday's report shows that the State has not vindicated the rights of the most vulnerable children in society.  Professor Shannon calls it a wake up call.  It is a damning indictment of how we go about trying to protect vulnerable children.  He analysed over 5,400 cases over eight years and said they revealed many unpalatable truths about our society.  He also said: "Children are treated like human trash in some of these cases."  He found failures in the PULSE, police using leading systems effectively, system, a lack of child protection training for garda&iacute;, poor and limited inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination and repeat removals of children.  In other words, children in vulnerable situations were removed by garda&iacute; under section 12, only to end up back in the same vulnerable setting shortly afterwards.  The complete absence of an out-of-hours social work service is highlighted in the report and Professor Shannon says there is also a troubling gap in how children with behavioural difficulties are treated by the system.  This, in many ways, represents a damning indictment of the Government's performance since the enactment of the change to the Constitution in 2012.  That amendment was all about protecting the children of the nation, particularly the most weak and vulnerable.  Why is there no comprehensive out-of-hours social work service?  What does the Government intend to do about this?  Why is there so little emphasis in the Garda Training College in Templemore on child protection training as a core part of the training programme?  This is something that emerged strongly from the audit.  Why is that so?  There is a need to fundamentally change our culture in how we protect vulnerable children in the community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000004#B00200"><p>Obviously, I am upset about this.  The establishment of Tusla as the Child and Family Agency was part of the overall strategy of making children and the family central in Ireland, with the appointment of a senior Minister to the Cabinet, the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, holding of a referendum on children's rights and passing of subsequent legislation in various respects that would impact on society and social Ireland.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is funded by the taxpayer to a substantial amount.  Last night's programme made for harrowing viewing, to say the least.  It showed the unconscionable circumstances in which some children in this country found themselves.  It is unacceptable.  This is in the place, their home, where they are supposed to feel most loved, safe and valued.  I believe I can speak for everybody here and every parent who watched in saying it was distressing viewing for parents.  I say to the social workers who feel they are battling a system and the trainees who feel the same way that they should not be afraid to speak up and speak out.  Many feel gagged and unable to speak the truth about what they know might be happening in some places.</p>  <p>  There are a number of criticisms made in the report, in the audit commissioned by the Garda and in the media coverage of it.  They relate, in particular, to the out-of-hours social work service and the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It must be remembered that the period under review is 2008 to the end of 2015 and that there have been continuous improvements in the child protection area and Tusla operations since.  Professor Shannon, whom I greatly respect, at the launch of the report on Monday, 29 May, expressed his full confidence in Tusla's child protection framework.  On the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015 and there is now a national service which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated.</p><p>There is emergency foster and residential care for a child removed from his or her family under this provision.  As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and on bank holidays to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in what are the busiest areas, namely, Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow.  In the remaining counties the volume of calls indicates that contact with Tusla social workers by telephone has been sufficient to date, but this is clearly under review.  Some concerns have been expressed about the placement of such children in Garda stations and hospitals.  I have been reassured that social admissions to hospital take place only in exceptional circumstances and only where a placement is for the child's own safety.  Tusla does not request the Garda to keep a child over part of a night.  That is a Garda decision.</p> <p> On the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am informed that regular strategic liaison meetings take place at senior level to deal with the inadequacy pointed to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000005#C00200"><p>The Taoiseach's last line, that Tusla does not instruct An Garda to keep anybody in a Garda station and that it is a matter for the Garda, sums it up.  It sums up the pathetic nature of buck-passing and is trying to mask the reality of the findings of the report which states the initial <i>de facto</i>place of safety for children is the Garda station.  There is no point in dressing it up or trying to sugar-coat it by saying it is a Garda decision.  One should remember that section 12 contains a very rare power.  A garda does not have to go to the courts or anything, but where he or she is convinced that a child is in danger, in the home or another setting, he or she must take him or her out of that danger.  However, he or she has nowhere to put the child.  There is no comprehensive out-of-hours social work service available.</p><p>It is not about people being gagged and so on.  This is a comprehensive report.  In fairness, I commend the Garda for commissioning the audit, but it involved very extensive consultation with garda&iacute; on the exercise of the section 12 power.  There is frustration and annoyance and a lack of basic resources in terms of the number of social workers in the field in this area.  The <i>de facto</i>position is that there is no proper comprehensive out-of-hours social work service available; that is the reality.  We need to go behind the language, rhetoric and  defensive position, acknowledge the essential truths in the report and resolve to deal with them.  The next budget should be the first signal on the resource side of such a commitment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000005#C00300"><p>As far as the Government and I are concerned, the issue should not be about the protection of the structure of Tusla but about the protection of children and accountability and transparency with regard to why the taxpayer puts money into Tusla in the first place.  That should be evident to everybody.  If that is not the case, we have to deal with the issue.  My understanding - the Minister has obviously asked for a full report on it - is that work is already well under way on the many issues commented on by Dr. Shannon in his final report.  Tusla will continue to roll out its national child care information system which will significantly improve the information available on vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  I understand the Garda national child protection unit is carrying out an audit at local level of the child protection operations between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to see what is happening, or, perhaps more importantly, what is not happening.  Divisional protective service units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a central feature of these units.  Why not?  In other places there are people who sit around the table from all of the various sectors to discuss these issues on a regular basis.  A joint protocol is being finalised between Tusla and the Garda on the operation of section 12 which is an important section of the Act.  This will provide clear and extensive guidance on a range of issues affecting children at risk.  It will address many of the issues raised in the report by Dr. Shannon.  </p>  <p>  Best practice in child protection is evolving all the time.  Research and reports like that of Dr. Shannon, commissioned by the Garda, provide a very necessary and valuable opportunity to review, reflect and strive to have an improved service.</p><p>We are not finished with this at all.  This has to be about the protection of children and not about the protection of the structure.  I share the Deputy's view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000006#D00200"><p>The report from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the State's special rapporteur on child protection, on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 and the details that emerged on last night's "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme are, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, both frightening and scandalous.  According to Dr. Shannon, co-operation between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is "overwhelmingly inadequate".  He made 17 recommendations.  As some of these are so basic and common sense, it raises the question as to why these were not put in place long before this.  For example, there is a recommendation on the need for all garda&iacute; to undergo diversity training and the need for inter-agency co-operation.  The big failures in the system are the lack of capacity, the absence of an out-of-hours service and Tusla's reliance on private foster care services.</p>  <p>  Dr. Shannon stated that vulnerable children are getting an inferior service and that it is absolutely scandalous that some of these private services refuse to take children with challenging behaviour.  I cannot think of a more telling indictment of the State's child protection services than the charge that vulnerable children are receiving an inferior service.  I am very certain the Taoiseach is upset by this.  However, I am sure that he will also accept that expressions of regret just will not cut it anymore.  The child protection system is broken and the Taoiseach's Government is charged with fixing it.  I call on the Taoiseach to ensure Dr. Shannon's 17 recommendations are implemented in full and that this is done immediately.</p>  <p>  Citizens will be shocked to hear that child protection training for garda&iacute; is basically non-existent.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said about strategic meetings at a senior level, according to this report, the lack of co-operation between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is simply breath-taking.  Last week, we discussed the crisis in child and adolescent mental health services.  This week it is a new set of scandals.  What will be next week or the week after?  This is not the first set of revelations about Tusla.  It is the duty of the Taoiseach's Government to change that reality.  The CEO of Tusla, Mr. Fred McBride, and Tusla must be held accountable.  He should appear before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, should appear before the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible to give the Government's response to this damning report.</p>  <p>  The initial response of Tusla, apparently attempting to undermine Dr. Shannon, is totally and absolutely unacceptable.  That is the knee-jerk reaction of most of the system in Ireland when criticised, whether by a whistleblower or the special rapporteur on child protection.  It is to undermine the criticism first.  My questions are very simple.  Will the Taoiseach fully commit to ensuring 24-hour access to social workers throughout this State as an urgent priority?  A total of 70% of the children taken in under section 12 were cases the garda&iacute; were already aware of.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that these cases are immediately followed up on to ensure the welfare of these children, including the children at the centre of the "RTE Investigates" programme?  Will he initiate a whole-of-Government response, rather than just a ministerial response, to this scandal, including an audit like that carried out by Dr. Shannon being conducted across the entire child protection system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000006#D00300"><p>I cannot disagree with the central issue of Deputy Adams's comments.  This has to be about accountability and not about zero accountability.  The Child and Family Agency was set up for a particular purpose as part of the response of Government to placing children and children's voices at the centre of Irish society, with a senior Ministry and Department dedicated directly to children.  There was a referendum on children's rights and there is legislation, dealing which issues from sexual abuse to marriage equality, which have covered issues of family and children.</p><p> The report by Dr. Shannon speaks for itself.  It is a very good report, a damning report and a very clear report.  He has made 27 recommendations, which must and will be followed through on.  The Minister will meet the Minister for Justice and Equality to address the issue of communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Deputy Adams is aware, section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 is an essential mechanism under which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs its child protection function and is only used as a measure of last resort.  The Garda Commissioner must respond to the report in respect of the training of garda&iacute;, including training for diversity, and the PULSE system and the deficiencies identified therein.  Deputies will recall that the Government has already dedicated substantial resources for investment in Garda IT infrastructure.  A total of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million in the capital plan, will be provided between 2016 and 2021.  Members will appreciate that the design, commissioning and the delivery of such a large-scale IT project takes time and we must get it right in the first place.  </p> <p> The report comments on deficiencies in child protection training for garda&iacute;, which is very concerning and needs to be seriously addressed.  While the design of course provision is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance, I am advised that the current Garda student and probationer training programme incorporates modules that address issues like sexual assault and the Children First guidelines.  The extent to which the existing training programme should be expanded or amended on foot of Dr. Shannon's recommendations must be addressed by the Garda Commissioner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their response to his report.  </p> <p> While acknowledging the serious issues raised for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the report, it is worth noting that there have been a number of important developments in Garda structures, including the establishment of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and the creation of the divisional protective services units.  I am advised that it is also proposed to create a national child protection unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so some things are happening.  My answer to Deputy Adams's question about whether this will receive a whole-of-Government response is "Yes".  The answer to the question about whether we will undertake to fulfill the 17 recommendations made by Dr. Shannon is also "Yes".  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000007#E00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer.  What we need now are results.  In 2012, the people of this State voted to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  Sinn F&eacute;in and others canvassed in that campaign.  I met many people who were sceptical because they did not trust the State.  If the Constitution is to have any value for these children, the Government must acknowledge that it is failing them and failing in our constitutional obligations to them.  I understand that the issues involved go back a long time.  The Taoiseach inherited this problem.  He did not create it.  In the past, this State outsourced its responsibilities to churches, religious orders and other institutions.  This is clearly no longer acceptable and the Taoiseach played his part in that.  Popular outrage is the guarantee that this will never happen again but we should not lose our sense of popular outrage.  Outsourcing the responsibility for children, particularly vulnerable children, to private for-profit companies should be equally unacceptable.  At the time that Tusla was established, we warned that without adequate resources, capacity and a change in culture, the initiative would fail.</p>  <p>  Our child protection system is broken and is essentially dysfunctional.  I welcome the Taoiseach's straightforward answer to my questions but if we are not to be back here next year or the year after or if somebody other than the Taoiseach and I is not to be back here again looking at another report like this, the Taoiseach needs to initiate that full Government response to which he committed and a complete overhaul of the child protection system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000007#E00300"><p>I did not have time to say it previously but the Garda Commissioner's modernisation and renewal programme from 2016 to 2021 and the policing plan for this year contain a commitment to implement a new Garda diversity and inclusion strategy.  I understand that this is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>I am advised that the new Garda strategy will embrace the recommendation from the Ombudsman for Children, arising from its review of the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invoked its powers under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 with regard to two Roma children, which was an issue of national public discussion and concern some time ago.  As part of this work, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to further training its workforce to develop its cultural competence in interacting with minority communities.</p> <p> I will finally say to the Deputy that in so far as my tenure continues here, I will see to it that this is initiated in respect of children.  We have done so much in terms of preparations and one of the central features of the child strategy issue has been the setting up of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  We want to see that this is enabled to do its work properly and, as I said to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the central issue here is about the protection of children, not the protection of jobs or the protection of a structure.  I will see that this happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000008#F00200"><p>I do not doubt the Taoiseach's sincerity on this issue, but I think all of us were shocked by the report of the special rapporteur on children and the screening last night by "RTE Investigates".  It was a special broadcast looking at the case studies and findings of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon as well as the detail of yet another disturbing case in my own south east region.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon has found chronic systems failures in the functions of Tusla.  He called for a change of culture across the entire child protection system.  How many times have we heard the phrase "a change of culture" in the last few weeks?  His words at a press conference yesterday sear into us, that there were children treated as human trash in some of these cases.  It is beyond shocking.  To read the case studies of the report is sobering and shocking.  An intoxicated woman slapped her eight-month old baby in a fast food restaurant, threw the baby in the air and dragged the child across wet ground.  Three young children aged five and two years and less than a year were wandering around the streets unsupervised, narrowly avoiding being hit by traffic.  Two children, aged two and six years, were unsupervised and watching television while their mother was out drinking.  These are not the worst of the cases.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has said that the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is to meet the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to discuss inter-agency co-operation between garda&iacute; and Tusla.  That is one recommendation.  Improving the sharing of information between the Garda and Tusla is welcome but it is not enough.  I cannot accept the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone's assertion this morning that Tusla is fit for purpose.  I do not believe anybody who watched the programme last night accepts that this is the current reality, whatever the potential of Tusla.  My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has been calling for some time now for a comprehensive 24-hour social work service for children at risk.  It is not a phone line, but a service that delivers the same protection for children as that which is delivered during normal office hours, and to every part of the country.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach commit to the delivery of such a 24-hour comprehensive service, and will he set out the timeline?  I do not expect him to set out the timeline this minute, but will he commit to setting a timeline for the instigation of such a service?  Will he make sure that all garda&iacute; receive appropriate child care protection training?  He mentioned that there is a new module in training in Templemore Garda training college now.  What about the huge existing cohort of garda&iacute;?  Will they be retrained?  Will the Taoiseach tell this House what other changes will be introduced, so that the referendum that we passed to vindicate the rights of children - we worked together in government to ask the people to support that - will become a reality and not merely an aspiration?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000008#F00300"><p>I am not happy about the situation that has arisen here.  I am pleased that Dr. Shannon's report is as authentic and straightforward as it is.  Tusla was the agency that said that it would be a ferocious corporate parent, looking after children.  There are clearly questions to be answered here as to what was happening with public time, public money and public employees when children, as identified in this programme, were in the situation and circumstances in which they found themselves.</p><p> I thank Deputy Howlin for his comment about being serious about this.  It is a case where this structure will, like all other structures, seek to defend itself.  The result is that vulnerable children are in very serious circumstances in some cases.  It is our responsibility to see that everything humanly possible is done to put that right and if that requires further answers from Tusla, then so be it.  As I said to Deputy Martin, this is not about zero accountability, it is about full accountability in respect of the most important people in the country who are our children.  I want to meet the principals involved here.  I want to speak to Dr. Shannon and to Tusla.  I also want to speak to both Ministers.  We cannot have a situation where there is a lack of engagement between the authorities and the agencies involved, the Garda and Tusla.</p> <p> I remember attending the launch of Tusla in Dublin Castle with the then Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we put forward the proposition that Tusla was a radical step forward in the protection of children.  Dr. Shannon's report points out serious inadequacies and we have to deal with those.  I undertake to do so.</p></speech>

That is why, in Government together, we looked at issues such as constitutional change, a Department for children and a Minister dedicated to children.  All of those tasks were done, but have they brought about this cultural change we are talking about that will deliver meaningful protection for every child?</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Taoiseach has said in terms of him taking the initiative to talk to everybody.  We need now to have that conversation here so that we have constant reporting, not only when issues arise and because we have asked the rapporteur or some agency to tell us about it.  We should have constant reviews and discussions about how we implement all of these changes that we brought about.  In many ways, changing the law, establishing a Department and even changing the Constitution is the easy bit.</p></speech>

It is about the change of the culture here.  The culture has been one of defence and structural protection.  The purpose and focus of Tusla was to deal with children and the protection of children and the care and the comfort and facilities for children.  As Deputy Howlin rightly says, we should not have to wait for any rapporteur's report to know what is happening here.  If there are inadequacies between the Garda communications and Tusla, then I will rectify that.  If this requires regular political oversight and monitoring, let us rectify that.  One cannot have children living in fear in urine-soaked clothes in situations where they deserve the protection and the support of the State.  There is nothing more important that this.</p>  <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon for his report, but let us see that the 17 recommendations are implemented.  I will be speaking to both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but also to Tusla.  I am not happy about this.  It goes to the central issue here.  This is about changing a culture from one of protection of structure and jobs to one of protection of children.</p></speech>

Superintendent Taylor claims Commissioner O'Sullivan sent a one-word reply, "Perfect."  We are told now that Commissioner O'Sullivan's phone from that time has gone missing and cannot be provided to the Charleton tribunal - perfect.  Superintendent Taylor's phone has not been provided to the Charleton tribunal either.  It was taken from him as part of an internal Garda investigation led by Commissioner O'Sullivan's husband and has not been returned to him.</p><p>Commissioner O' Sullivan's husband has Superintendent Taylor's phone and the Commissioner cannot find her own phone -  perfect, again.  A senior Garda source told <i>The Irish Times</i>that &quot;A search of Garda headquarters has taken place in recent weeks to try to find the missing phones, but there is little hope of the material being found at this stage&quot;.  I would say not.  Was that phone officially reported missing?  If so, when exactly?  Was Martin Callinan's phone officially reported missing?  If so, when exactly?  I am given to understand that N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan used a second personal phone, known as the &quot;off-site&quot; phone, for some Garda business.  Has this phone been sought or has she lost it too?  <br/><br/> More than 1,200 people at 100 sampling points in all constituencies were asked last Tuesday and Wednesday, before the story of the missing phones broke, whether N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan should resign.  A total of 57% said she should resign, 23% said she should not, while 19% expressed no opinion.  This means that nearly three out of every four who expressed an opinion said that she should go.  The people who are policed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the people who pay their wages, have spoken decisively on this issue.  The Government's failure to act reveals a huge democratic deficit on policing and threatens to open up a crisis of legitimacy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br/><br/>There has been lots of talk this week about legacy.  This is all part of the Taoiseach's legacy and it is far from perfect.  Is the Taoiseach going to continue to keep the Garda Commissioner in her position and allow the further undermining of the Charleton tribunal?  </p></speech>

I believe that Mr. Justice Charleton is the most appropriate person to carry out the required investigation.  He has already adopted an absolutely no-nonsense approach to dealing with the business before him.  He has set out the timelines, the strategy and the focus of public hearings.  Deputy Barry has come into this House with a report from a journalist that a phone is missing that was in the possession of the Garda Commissioner.  I do not know whether that is true or whether it is an allegation that stands up but I expect that Mr. Justice Charleton will find out the truth of that.  He has already pointed out that public hearings on this matter will take place in July.  Obviously he is a person of long experience, having worked on the Morris tribunal and having dealt with matters as complex as this in the past.  He is the very best person to deal with the matter.  I reject the Deputy's assertion that the Government has not done anything about this.  The Government has set up a full formal commission of investigation under a very competent sole member to deal with the matter.  The terms of reference of the tribunal are comprehensive and Mr. Justice Charleton will not stand on ceremony in getting to the truth of the issue.  I would be loathe to accept what the Deputy has said because I do not have any idea whether it is true.  It is an allegation and a report.  I would much prefer to leave the determination of the facts and the truth to Mr. Justice Charleton.  I have every faith that he will discharge his duties and responsibilities to the utmost level of satisfaction.</p></speech>

We would like this House to debate that change of Standing Orders, not least because it has quite a serious impact on the extent to which new politics applies in this House because it will hit Senators and Deputies who have a track record of fighting on the issue of abortion rights and for a pro-repeal stance disproportionately as against the way it will affect the larger parties.  Some of the larger parties struggled to find people to sit on that committee.</p>  <p>  On an obvious point, substitution needs to be allowed because a Member could become ill, have a family disaster or fall under a bus and need to have a substitute on the committee.  This issue is not so simple as the Business Committee portrays it to be.  There should be room for a debate in the House, otherwise what does new politics mean if we cannot reflect it in terms of how we deal with this issue?

There must be some degree of certainty and solidity about our work.  If a recommendation comes from the Business Committee to proceed in a certain manner, we should take the vote.  We cannot just have four or five people standing up every week and saying that because they do not agree with the order, we will not proceed.  We are trying to accommodate every nuance and position.

We all agree with that commitment and, by and large, our diplomats have been very effective in promoting these objectives.  However, every Deputy is equally clear and deeply concerned about the denial of fundamental human rights to Ibrahim Halawa, particularly now that his case has been deferred yet again.  This is the 24th time his case has been deferred, which is a shocking undermining of his basic human rights and exceptionally unfair, given all of the previous commitments to allow the trial to proceed.  His ongoing detention without trial and treatment while in prison speak to the core of the objective of the programme for Government.  In that context, when did the Taoiseach last speak to the Prime Minister of Egypt about progressing matters for Ibrahim Halawa?  Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade sought to utilise the European Union and the United Nations to make combined efforts to secure justice in this case and bring some solace to Ibrahim Halawa's very frustrated family who feel helpless in the face of ongoing events.</p></speech>

I have spoken to him directly on two occasions and have also written him a very strong letter.  We have supported the all-party delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle and the request for release on humanitarian grounds.  The Cabinet made a decision to send an Irish medical doctor to Egypt to assess Ibrahim Halawa's health.  I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring the Deputy up to date on the latest position.</p></speech>

The delay is worrying and the continuing detention of our citizen is unfair and unjust.  On the specific questions posed by the Deputy, I raised the issue only last week at EU level with a number of EU foreign affairs colleagues, as well as with High Representative Mogherini and expressed the concern of the Irish people and Government.  I meet on a weekly basis with the Egyptian ambassador who is in no doubt about the Government's position on the issue.  I am concerned about the further adjournment until 4 July, but the reason for such a lengthy adjournment is Ramadan.  In Egypt the courts do not as a rule sit during that season.  In the meantime, the welfare and health of our citizen are very much to the fore and we are making representations and monitoring the position on a daily basis.</p></speech>

Our policy goes further than the report, but I warmly welcome its publication because it commits to a public health service.  There have been numerous reports on our health services and Governments of the day have refused to implement them.  Members of the committee were part of those Governments at that time.  This report will be no different unless a government implements it.  The recommendations include an implementation committee, answerable to the Taoiseach as well as to the Minister for Health, and a Cabinet subcommittee.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has had a chance to be briefed or to read the report, but will he look positively at the report and will he commit to it?</p></speech>

The important thing is there is cross-party political consensus on the main issues in the report, and from a politician's perspective, this is an important element which we have not had before.  I commend the members of the committee, who have worked to remove elements of the health system from becoming political footballs.  It is a matter of assessing the full report and having a debate on it here and, in so far as possible, following through on it.  We will do this and come back into the House.</p></speech>

It is no exaggeration to say he seems obsessed with an area for which he has no ministerial responsibility.  Many of us may have concerns about what he proposes, but we will debate it when it actually happens.  Having listened to plenty of hyperbole from the Minister, Deputy Ross, over the past year <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>made for staggering reading this week.  We discovered that in advance of the new system coming into play, the Minister, Deputy Ross, last week agreed to the appointment of a batch of new judges, including one for a vacancy which, we understand, will not arise until next November.  Having acted as the arch critic of any Government interference or of a political fingerprint on the appointment of judges, apparently the only political interference to be allowed is his own.  We read about his double standards in the newspaper.  Apparently, not only did he determine who was to be appointed but, according to the report, he went through each of the appointments with a fine-tooth comb.  Since the Minister, Deputy Ross, seems to think, like Donald Trump, that his vetting is non-political because he is a non-politician, will the Government continue with the new judicial appointment system or is the new Ross system to be the norm?</p></speech>

Members will have different views on it, but it is agreed from a Government perspective.  This is a radical departure bringing transparency, yet it retains the responsibility of Cabinet making decisions at Government level on judicial appointments and having a choice to do so.  It is expected to be come in on 20 June and let see how it progresses.  The intention is to have it resolved and put through before the summer recess, but this depends on the views of Deputies who comment.</p></speech>

Many people are aware that at this time of the year, particularly as we head into the holiday season and the season of long evenings, people will attend the theme parks and funfairs that operate throughout the country during the holiday period.  A very informative and detailed RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme screened recently brought this issue to my attention.  The degree of regulation and oversight for members of the public in our theme parks and funfairs is pretty much negligible.  The only oversight we have at present of parks and funfairs is that when they are being established they must apply for a safety certificate from the local authority.</p><p>The problem has to do with public safety.  We have an issue with public safety, as was detailed in at least one case outlined in the RTE programme.  If a member of the public is hurt, or has a concern about his or her own safety or the safety of any member of the public, in a theme park or funfair there is nowhere to go to ask for an issue to be investigated.  The Bill sets out to amend the enabling legislation of the Health and Safety Authority to give it an oversight role in receiving and investigating complaints by users of funfairs and theme parks.  It will be a new departure for the Health and Safety Authority.  It will broaden its remit and give it the authority to receive such complaints and investigate them.  With regard to it being a public safety initiative, it is something which will go a long way towards addressing some of the issues and concerns which have been brought to us.</p><p>We met the showmen's guild, which is the umbrella group and representative association of the operators of funfairs and theme parks, and we received very constructive input from it.  My colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, was instrumental in arranging the briefing session we had with it.  The guild was quite happy with what we have set out in the legislation and with what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>The legislation is to broaden the remit of the Health and Safety Authority on a public safety initiative and I am offering it to the House on this basis.</p></speech>

In addition to the meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments that might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</p><p> As regards the meeting of 25 May, its purpose was to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack.</p> <p> As well as the T&aacute;naiste and me, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended, with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff and senior officials.  The meeting was briefed on the current threat assessment by the security authorities.  It was noted that while a terrorist attack was possible, it was unlikely and that there was no specific information on any threat to Ireland from international terrorism.  This assessment will remain under continuous review.  The authorities remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the European Union and beyond.  The Garda authorities, supported by the Defence Forces, are engaged in ongoing work aimed at preventing an attack taking place.  Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack.  Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents.</p> <p> Ministers were also briefed on the overall national emergency management arrangements, involving all of the agencies of the State, and how the arrangements would operate in the event of a major incident.  The meeting was advised that the Garda authorities were working closely with event organisers to ensure appropriate safety and security measures were in place at major events.  The Garda is asking the public to remain vigilant and report immediately any issue which gives rise to concern.</p> <p> Of equal importance is ongoing work to ensure people do not become alienated from our society and radicalised.  Terrorism is caused not by particular religions or peoples but by hatred.  The aim of international terrorism is to change our way of life through creating fear.  We cannot and will not allow that to happen.  It is important that we abide by our values and continue to live our lives to the full in a free society.</p></reply>

National security issues, however, allow governments that are basically democratic to opt out of these responsibilities and justify actions which often constitute gross infringements of human rights under the guise of protecting citizens.  Ireland's national security committee, NSC, by its nature, deals with sensitive information and intelligence on both dissident and international threats, some of which must be kept confidential for obvious reasons.  However, the secrecy surrounding this organ of the State is unparalleled.  Although operational matters regarding State security fall to various units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the NSC dictates the State's response to issues of defence, intelligence and national security and advises the Government on them.  All information on meetings of the NSC, including the dates of past meetings, is kept secret and the NSC answers to nobody but itself.  The equivalent UK body reports directly to the Intelligence and Security Committee of the Westminster Parliament which was set up in 1994 and is responsible for the management and oversight of the policy on, administration and expenditure of all security services, including the Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, and provides for oversight of defence intelligence in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office.</p>  <p>  In June 2015 the Taoiseach admitted to the House that Ireland could not consider itself to be immune from international terrorist threats.  However, at the same time he is happy to continue Ireland's complicity with the US military machine by allowing US aircraft operating in theatres of war to land at Shannon Airport and overfly Irish airspace.  Some of these aircraft are even thought to have stopped at Shannon Airport while on rendition flights.  Permitting US aircraft to use Shannon Airport unchecked is a tacit declaration of support for the United States' murderous policies in the Middle East.  This breach of our neutrality is surely a prime reason Ireland might be seen as a target for international terrorism.  Does the Taoiseach think we should re-think allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base?</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach outline the accountability and scrutiny mechanisms in place for overseeing the role of the National Security Committee?  Does the committee share or authorise the sharing of intelligence information with other governments?  Is anybody politically responsible for clearing it?  There has been some speculation about the possibility of establishing an overarching, more structured agency with responsibility for security.  Willl the Taoiseach give us an update?</p></speech>

It would be extremely naive to think this country would not possibly be the site of an attack.  We must have a proper debate about these matters.  To put it bluntly, the notion that there is a secret committee examining and hearing about threats to the State is fine, but there must be some democratic exchange about these matters, either through a committee of the House or the briefing of leaders.  Some mechanism must be found.  We have moved into a new space.  For example, have efforts been made to assess the number of people moving from conflict zones back to Ireland?  How do we identify such persons?  Are they monitored in Ireland?</p>  <p>  During my period in government I recall that when I introduced Estimates, there was always a Secret Service Vote.  It was a matter of conjecture what that Vote was.  It was always for a token sum of &euro;1 million, a relatively small sum of money.  Do we have a Vote for a proper intelligence service?  To pick up on the last question asked by Deputy Gerry Adams, the last time we held this discussion in the House I raised the need for a separate intelligence security unit.  There are two reasons, one of which is that we are now in a different space or paradigm.  Second, cyber security is an area into which we must put effort and resources.  We saw what happened - I am not saying it was a cyber attack -- when there was a breakdown in a computer system at British Airways which crippled that enormous company worldwide.  Are we protected against cyber attacks?  We must have such capacity, but I am not sure we have.  Will the Taoiseach give his views on the matter?</p></speech>

There is an immediate question that requires an answer.  How will we co-operate with the UK Government in the post-Brexit era if we are to have a common travel area?  It was reported, although it is only conjecture at this stage, that one of the people detained after the bombing in Manchester last week had spent some time in Ireland.  That will continue post-Brexit.  I also recall reading in some of the British media last weekend that one of the concerns post-Brexit was that the sharing of intelligence information with European colleagues would be increasingly difficult.  What is the mechanism post-Brexit for us to share security information with the British Government, especially given that we have a common travel area and such strong connections?  I also call on the Taoiseach to provide for the wider involvement of Members of the House in overseeing what our security officials are doing in this regard.  It is important that it not be done in secret.  Obviously, one understands the need for secrecy, but there is a requirement for democratic oversight, as occurs at Westminster but not here.</p></speech>

There can never be any justification - I do not quite agree with Deputy Mick Wallace's perspective - for slaughtering innocents and civilians in the manner in which they were slaughtered in Manchester.  We have had experience of this in the past.  The IRA campaign of bombing civilians was no different from what we witnessed in Manchester last week, including the bombings in Birmingham, Enniskillen and at La Mon.  There can be no moral equivocation about which is worse.  The fundamental difference between the two is that, in the case of the IRA, in motst cases the perpetrators made sure that they got away before many civilians were brutally slain for no justifiable reason.</p><p>I agree with Deputy Brendan Howlin that we cannot be complacent.  We are a soft target, like many others.  The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of ISIS operators is to hit where they can and to hit the softest target they possibly can.  In the past, owing to what happened in Northern Ireland because of the IRA's campaign, we had much stronger security capacity.</p><p>That is my sense of it.  Since the peace process, we have lost a lot of corporate intelligence and so on.  We really need to recreate it in the context of the ISIS threat.</p> <p> On the issue of having a separate crime and security agency, the Kathleen O'Toole commission should be asked to ascertain the optimal approach for us to intelligence and security.  The battle against ISIS and others is about trying to counter extremism on the ground and in communities, which is very important, and also about having deep and good intelligence to avert atrocities.  Are Irish citizens who return having fought in Iraq or Syria on behalf of ISIS tracked?  Is there any penalty for those who participate with ISIS overseas?  Are they just allowed back into the country?  The Minister for Justice and Equality said in answering questions that it was known that up to 30 people had participated in Syria and Iraq.  Can they just fly back in with no penalties?  Do our laws need to be overhauled in that regard?  We have to have zero tolerance of anybody who participates in such activity overseas and who has the freedom to come back and carry on as if life were normal.</p></speech>

What would be the cost of such an agency?  We are all aware that many reports are being produced and that many commissions are working on various elements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is this one of the issues that will be examined?</p>  <p>  Deputy Enda Kenny, as the outgoing Taoiseach, may be very well placed to offer some insights, in the context of his experience as Taoiseach, into what would be the optimum.  We hear a lot of dissatisfaction being expressed about how protected Ireland is.  We hear suggestions of inadequate resources at various points at ports and airports.  In my constituency and most of the Leinster region there is a very high number of people from other countries, which is very good.  We also know that we have a very significant Libyan population living in Ireland.  There should be more focus on integration, particularly of young people, in schools and colleges and, in particular, our efforts to ensure they do as well as possible in the school system and will also have opportunities to engage in further education and employment.  Otherwise, we could end up with people with great hopes but who are left outside our systems, as happens in other countries.  Therein lies the danger.</p></speech>

There are some things one can say and some things one cannot say.  Facilities at Shannon Airport have been used for many years by members of the US Air Force, but I have no evidence of rendition flights through it.  Deputy Mick Wallace has been there on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gerry Adams has stated we cannot consider ourselves to be immune.  That is true and there is no complacency.  The weapons of bombers have changed and are changing.  Clearly, the incidents in France, Belgium, Berlin and Sweden lead us to believe this.  There is now the capacity to take remote control of a vehicle and drive it at speed into a crowd of people, with or without a driver.  More primitive weapons are being used to carry out the same destruction, leading to international incidents.</p>  <p>  The question of having a separate security group or force has been raised.  I am not sure we want an MI5 or an MI6 here, but the O'Toole commission which is examining the structure, policing and security matters, as raised by Deputies M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin, Brendan Howlin and Joan Burton, can consider the matter in a way which allows us to reflect a very dangerous and changing world. </p>  <p>  As Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin is aware, the Defence Forces obviously have intelligence available to them on small numbers of people who might be in the country for purposes other than peaceful living.  They are under review on a constant basis.  That intelligence is made available to the Garda and shared on a very regular basis.  Clearly, the Garda and the security forces generally are in constant touch, or daily contact, with Britain, the rest of Europe and beyond, where necessary.</p>  <p>  Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin referred to the slaughter of innocent victims.  While all cases are tragic, one of the differences is that suicide bombers want to be blown up.  The Provisional IRA did not want that to happen.  It caused the same destruction and no warnings were given and people suffered tragic consequences.</p>  <p>  The preparations for a serious incident here have covered and do cover a range of options, about which I cannot speak.  No matter where one puts the cordon of security, however, people have to gather outside it to get in and these are always issues of grave concern.  I expect the O'Toole commission to examine the issue of security or a security element-----</p></speech>

If there is to be a second element, which may well be worthwhile, that is another matter.  I do not want to prejudge the expertise available to the O'Toole commission.  The evolution through the independent Policing Authority and the changes with GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate will all lead to a change in culture in the Garda over a number of years.  Whether it would be right to have a second intelligence and security element is a matter I do not want to prejudge, but it is working well in other countries.  We have had our own system.  Obviously, there have been inadequacies that we are trying to rectify.</p>  <p>  Radicalisation has been mentioned.  It is not a religious issue.  The Garda has the capacity to engage with different and diverse communities to understand what is happening and what is likely to be of interest to us.  There is a lot of activity in that area.</p>  <p>  Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin mentioned people coming back to Ireland having fought with ISIS.  As I said, there is a small number of people in the country who are certainly under scrutiny. </p>  <p>  Deputy Joan Burton raised the question of having an intelligence agency.  It will certainly be an element of the focus of the O'Toole commission.  I do not want to prejudge it.  Let us get the system we have in place right.  I assure Members that at the meeting I attended with representatives of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the health, transport and aviation sectors they informed me that they were all very active in looking out for potential incidents that might occur here.  The sharing of information is important.  It is quite complex and very complicated in terms of the information stored on servers here with major companies.  Privacy and the protection of data are very strongly valued by them, yet we have to share information with our UK colleagues who might see potential terrorists passing through Britain, including to case a place with the intention of carrying out an incident later.  That is a matter we have to deal with through legislation, which is very complicated.  At the same time, we have to and do share information on potential terrorists with our colleagues across the water.  That is an issue that is being focused on by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the report of the working group on Seanad reform, the Manning Report.  That report was published in 2015 and is available on the Department's website.  One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the report.   </p>  <p>  As I said previously, I agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that this group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.  I wrote to party leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate.  Contacts are still continuing with parties to finalise nominations with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I know that Mr. Maurice Manning chaired of the implementation group.  The group carried out a very detailed report and everything like that.  Now we apparently have an implementation plan.  From a human point of view, I think we all understand the Taoiseach's reluctance.  I am sure that whoever his successor is will go at the Seanad with great gusto.  In the meantime, could the Taoiseach possibly update us on where matters stand at this point in time?  Is there anything else that he would like to see Seanad &Eacute;ireann do now that it is available as part of the democratic process, notwithstanding the fact that the Taoiseach once had some ideas to the contrary?</p></speech>

He also went on to say, if I got it right, that contact continues with the party leaders about the chair.  That is news to me and, by the response of the other leaders in the House, it must be news to them as well.  Therefore, it is two years since the Manning report on Seanad reform was published.  The Taoiseach has not even agreed who the chair of the implementation group will be.  At the time, we welcomed the Government's commitment to the Manning recommendations.  It was also about the right to vote in Seanad elections for citizens in the North and the diaspora.  That reflects, as the Taoiseach knows, the views of the Constitutional Convention of September 2013.  However, like other issues, this is a mark of the paralysis of this Government.  Before the Taoiseach leaves office, perhaps he could appoint someone to chair the implementation group on Seanad reform.</p></speech>

I would like to ask a few very direct questions.  Is it the fixed Government position that the Manning proposals are the blueprint for what should happen into the future?  If the answer to that question is "Yes", why has no action been taken to begin the process of implementation?  Will there be any changes in the structure of the Seanad or in the electoral process to elect the next Seanad before the next general election?</p></speech>

Could the Taoiseach identify who has not responded to his request?  We wrote back on 2 December with three names.  Has the Fine Gael party finalised its nominees?  There has been a kind of silence for the last couple of months.  I note from previous meetings that we had during the last Government that the Taoiseach was, to be fair, decidedly unenthusiastic about the whole project.  I heard recently that the former Senator, Mr. Maurice Manning, is a good cordial friend of the Taoiseach's and has had the occasional pint with the Taoiseach.  He never mentioned anything to do with politics when he had the odd pint with the Taoiseach, but one would have thought that the old matter of the implementation of the Manning report might have surfaced as one pint turned to two or maybe even three.  I thought it might have been slipped in at some stage.  In a serious vein, we are all committed to it.  We have compromised.  Our position was for a stronger mass electorate, but we accepted the Manning compromise.  It can be facilitated through legislation.  Everyone in the House wants it to happen.  As one of the Taoiseach's final acts before he hands on to his successor, perhaps he might get it up and running and get it formed.</p></speech>

I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister of State for European affairs.  The meeting provided an opportunity, following the European Council's adoption of the EU negotiating guidelines and in advance of agreement on the more detailed negotiating directives, to thank Mr. Barnier for his openness to Ireland in relation to our particular concerns arising from Brexit and to highlight our thoughts about the process ahead.</p>  <p>  We discussed the serious implications in relation to peace and stability in Northern Ireland and the Border, and for the Irish economy, particularly the fisheries and agrifood sector.  I commended Mr. Barnier on his address to the Oireachtas that morning and expressed confidence in his ability to negotiate on behalf of the EU 27 and to take account of Ireland's particular concerns. </p>  <p>  Mr. Barnier stressed the complexities of the issues involved in the negotiations and outlined his intention to be firm but fair.  He committed to ensuring that the task force remains accessible to all Member States and especially to Ireland, given our unique concerns. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing daily engagement on Brexit and on other EU issues between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, with the permanent representation in Brussels and our network of missions across the EU, with a view to ensuring a comprehensive approach to EU affairs.  There is also of course ongoing interaction across all Government Departments on the range of EU issues, including through regular meetings of the senior officials group on the EU and the inter-departmental group on Brexit, which is chaired by the second Secretary General in my Department. </p>  <p>  This is consistent with the approach set out in my Department's statement of strategy, which identified the need for a whole-of-government approach to the Brexit negotiations. </p>  <p>  The second Secretary General also acts as Ireland's sherpa and, in this capacity, meets and engages regularly with his EU counterparts.  Since the triggering of Article 50 on 29 March, there have been two formal sherpa meetings under the Article 50 format, one on 11 April and another on 24 April.  Ireland participated fully in both of these. </p>  <p>  The discussions focused on the EU negotiating guidelines, which were subsequently agreed by the European Council on 29 April. </p>  <p>  The negotiations on Brexit, which will be conducted by the Commission, will be guided by the European Council in its Article 50 format, that is, the heads of state and government of the 27 member states. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ministers at the General Affairs Council now also discuss issues relating to Brexit in the Article 50 format.</p><p>At official level, the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, COREPER, and the new working party are also meeting at 27 to discuss issues relating to Brexit.  COREPER meets on a weekly basis.  The new working party first met on 23 May and it is expected to meet twice a week from now on.  Of course, there are also daily meetings of working groups on the full range of EU issues and these groups include representatives of all member states, including Ireland. </p></reply>

This makes the decision of the Government, if the Taoiseach can confirm it, to sell off a significant portion of AIB for something like &euro;3 billion and apply that &euro;3 billion under the un-amended fiscal rules to the writing down of something like a point on the national debt all the more extraordinary.  This is an entirely futile exercise in the context of the economy growing and the debt reducing.  In his discussions with Michel Barnier, did the Taoiseach look for special arrangements relating to Ireland in the case of no deal or a very difficult Brexit whereby we would get additional resources and a specific change in the fiscal rules?  The Government has put forward the barmy idea of using the AIB money to unnecessarily pay down the national debt instead of investing in our roads, public transport, schools, housing and hospitals.  The Government's decision is mind boggling and a disgraceful use of resources the Irish people paid for at great cost.</p></speech>

The first deals with essential principles on citizens' rights and covers the protection of EU citizens' rights and British nationals following Brexit.  This is the one on which I will concentrate.  The paper on citizens' rights sets out the protections EU wants to secure for nearly 5 million people who will be affected by Brexit, including Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  The document stresses that the European Court of Justice must have full jurisdiction for ruling on disputes about citizens' rights while the European Commission ought to have full powers for monitoring whether the British Government is upholding that part of the bargain.  The British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, has already railed against this.  Can the Taoiseach confirm when the Irish Government will discuss these papers with our EU partners and whether the Government has any amendments or proposed amendments to these papers?  According to the EU, further policy papers are expected in the next few days.  Will the Government agree to distribute all such papers?  Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, has called for a referendum on a united Ireland following Brexit.  Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming this?</p></speech>

When will we see this publication?  I have a brief question relating to the very worrying position that was repeated last night in the British general election debate that the likely outcome of the hard line taken by the UK will be no deal.  Have our officials produced any scoping of what the consequences of this scenario will be?  In respect of the UK declaration that it also wants to hold on to the EU agencies currently sited in the UK, is this a possibility?  What is the formal view of this Government and the EU in that regard?</p></speech>

Since I posed that question, new information has emerged from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the number of officials.  It turns out that when we look at the number of officials who have been hired, we can see that we have hired less than one quarter of the allocation.  The allocation was not enough to begin with.  IDA Ireland was allocated ten Brexit staff but it turns out that it has hired one.  Enterprise Ireland was allocated 39 Brexit staff but has hired just 12.  Science Foundation Ireland was allocated three but has yet to hire a single person.  The Health and Safety Authority was allocated two but has yet to hire a single person.  Of the 54 Brexit officials the Government has given sanction to hire, only 13 have been hired.  This is less than one quarter.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, we are moving closer and closer to no deal and need to start scenario planning around what a cliff would look like.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House why, given the severity of Brexit and the mounting materiality of Ireland hitting a cliff, the State agencies tasked with dealing with this have hired less than one quarter of the already insufficient allocation they were given?</p></speech>

This document sets out the sectoral consequences of Brexit.  The list is endless with regard to agriculture; fishing rights; trade issues generally; transport and aviation; tourism; health, including treatment abroad; education, including the recognition of qualifications; financial services; data protection; global security; the common travel area, including social welfare and pension rights; the single electricity market; used car imports; cross-Border crime; and research and development.  On and on it goes.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there is co-ordination between Departments?  Even at this late stage, does he not think we need a Brexit Minister to co-ordinate the response across Government Departments and among the different sectors affected by Brexit?</p></speech>

We all know Theresa May is an absolute horror who is trying to use the exit vote to pursue her little Englander, anti-immigrant, hard-line austerity agenda.  However, when Monsieur Barnier was here, he gave fairly strong indications that the EU is also going to play political games on the issue of exit - talking about how there must be consequences for exiting the EU.  I put it to the Taoiseach that between the horror of Theresa May and the politicking of the EU, this country is piggy in the middle in a political game between these two blocs.  The question is whether the Taoiseach is going to stand up to this politicking and demand that we have a say in whatever deal or arrangement they come up with.  It is clear that neither Theresa May nor the EU gives a damn, or are cavalier, about the consequences of their approach to the exit negotiations on this country.  They clearly do not give a hoot about the Border or the common travel area and are playing politics.  Are we going to demand a referendum on the final deal?  I ask this question very seriously.  Are we going to demand a veto on any deal they hatch or that impacts on us and does not suit us in respect of the issues on which there is consensus North and South?</p></speech>

Given that the British Prime Minister again last night went back to the "no deal is better than a bad deal" scenario, will the Taoiseach or his successor insist that this issue - that the UK Secretary of State, Mr. David Davis says is going to be the row of the summer - should be raised at the June council on 22 June so that we can have our Irish interests represented immediately rather than waiting for events to unfold?  Will the Taoiseach put trade issues with regard to the Border on the June council agenda, or would he recommend his successor do so, to ensure that they are not ignored?</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance has taken a lead role on this.  Under EU fiscal rules, the proceeds of any sale may not be used to fund increased expenditure irrespective of whether such expenditure is classified as current or as capital.  On the accounting treatment of any proceeds from such a transaction, the position is that the sale of such financial assets does not result in a beneficial impact to the general Government balance under EUROSTAT rules.  This is because it is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of assets, such as shares, for another kind, such as cash.  Consequently, the sale of any share-holding in a bank would not count as general Government revenue, and would not create any scope for increased spending on the basis of the proceeds that are realised.  There will be no increased capacity for spending following any sale of bank shares.  The Minister for Finance will make his decision on this matter in the next 48 hours.</p></speech>

A lower debt level is not only beneficial for the fiscal sustainability of the State, but will also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.

We are engaged with Brussels and London on a daily basis about all of these matters.  The Government will respond to the papers and they can be debated here.  I note the Deputy's comment about Mr. Colum Eastwood, MLA, and the united Ireland referendum.  I do not believe that the conditions are right for it at the moment, but I was happy that the European Council reflected carefully on the visionaries who put their words together on the Good Friday Agreement such that, if that process ever happens and people decide to have a democratic vote by consent to join the Republic, the entire island becomes a full member of the European Union, irrespective of the decision to leave as part of Britain under the Brexit negotiations.</p><p>Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of the EU agencies here.  Clearly, Ireland has applied for both of them, as other countries have.  These are European agencies that will be based in a European country.  We are competing with Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg for the financial one and with other countries for the medical agency, and we will compete strongly for those.  We tick many of the relevant boxes.  That will eventually be decided by the European Council, probably in the autumn.</p><p>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly raised the level of meetings in the negotiations.  These negotiations have not begun at all yet.  All we are doing is setting out the strategy and groundwork, and we have those principles established.  When the Deputy says that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have not taken up all of the approved numbers, they will be employed as needs be, and outside expertise will be employed if necessary.  The negotiations have not begun in detail yet.  The Deputy also spoke about what he termed &quot;mounting materiality&quot;, which is not a common phrase used down in the country, I have to say.<b></b>In any event, there is a daily contact going on about all of these issues.  As needs be, the staff and personnel will be recruited, and if expertise is needed, that will also be recruited.</p><p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey mentioned co-ordination between Departments.  There is co-ordination on a daily basis.  On having a Minister with responsibility for Brexit, I made the point before that the decisions are made by the European Council.  If a Brexit Minister was appointed, he or she could not even attend the General Affairs Council, which makes the initial preparatory decisions before they go to the European Council.  Let us say that Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett becomes the Brexit Minister, he cannot attend the General Affairs Council, he cannot attend at the European Council-----</p></speech>

Of these, approximately 34,000 were first-time applications and 46,000 were renewals.</p>  <p>  The turnaround time for online applications is 10 working days plus postage.  The target turnaround time for Passport Express renewal applications is 15 working days and this is currently being met.  The target turnaround time for first-time applications and applications for renewal of lost, stolen or damaged passports through Passport Express is 20 working days.  These categories of application take longer due to the extra security checks involved.</p><p>The average turnaround time for these applications is currently 24 working days.  This is mainly as a result of the exceptionally large volume of applications in the processing system.</p> <p> As more applicants use the online passport application service, the efficiency gains will help improve turnaround times more broadly.  I urge all Deputies to promote the use of this service to all adults who qualify.</p> <p> I take the opportunity also to reiterate how important it is that applicants choose the most appropriate application channel, depending on their individual circumstances.  The Passport Express option should only be used by those who are travelling in three weeks or more.  Anyone renewing a passport who needs to travel in under three weeks should make an appointment online to apply in person at the Passport Office, in either Dublin or Cork.  Naturally, there is a limited number of such appointments available and it is important that we collectively promote best practice and encourage citizens to check their passport is in date before booking travel.  It is considered best practice to allow six weeks for a passport application, as difficulties can arise where an application is incomplete or where further information is required.</p> <p> My Department provides a free renewal reminder email service and I ask Deputies to join me in promoting the use of this service.</p> <p> All applicants are advised on notes accompanying the passport application form to check current turnaround times online on the website of my Department.  These are updated on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

I commend the staff in the Passport Office who are under severe pressure and who are doing their level best to deal with the increased demand.</p>  <p>  The Minister may have heard the Irish ambassador to Britain, H.E. Mr. Dan Mulhall, earlier today talking about the dramatic increase in passport applications from the United Kingdom.  There was a 9% increase last year, year on year.  It is probably projected to increase further.</p>  <p>  I met the head of the Passport Service quite recently.  I want to know does the Passport Office have the resources it needs.  Is the Minister confident that they have the manpower and systems in place?  I note the online renewal and online passport application has been successful in the short time since it has been launched.</p>  <p>  Like all other Deputies and the Minister, I receive on a daily basis calls from distressed citizens whose passports will not be available in time for them to travel.  It is particularly stressful.  There are families paying a lot of money for probably the one holiday they will get each year.  Has there been any thought of looking at changing the application, in so far as those with travel documents are concerned as opposed to the increase in applications coming in from Britain merely to have the passport but not necessarily with a need to travel?  Is the Minister looking at any changes in procedures at present and will we be able to continue to cope with the increased demand?</p></speech>

A total of 75,145 applications have come from Northern Ireland and almost 70,000 from Great Britain between 25 June last year and 29 May this year.  This is an increase of 50% from Northern Ireland and 55% from Great Britain over that period.  I keep the situation under review at all times.</p>  <p>  I welcome suggestions from Deputies.  I was pleased to have the matter introduced by way of discussion at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence last week.</p>  <p>  We have taken on new staff.  As of January this year, 301 permanent full-time equivalent staff were assigned to the Passport Service.  This is up 272 full-time equivalent staff from January 2015.  To assist with strong seasonal demand from April to July, we have almost 230 temporary clerical officers in place.  The matter remains under review.</p>  <p>  It is a challenge but we are anxious to provide a level of service that will deal with all of applications in a timely manner.  My advice must be for citizens to check their passport and apply in time.</p></speech>

As I have said, all of us will be aware of the stresses that this generates for families when they find their passports may not be processed in time or are out of date.  The first thing people should do, before any holidays or travel is booked, is to check their passport.</p>  <p>  The figures the Minister has given me in relation to the increases in applications in such a short time, from the North of Ireland of 50% and from Britain of 55%, are stark.  Has the Department, in conjunction with the diplomatic service in Britain, looked at projecting that forward into next year?  If anything, when we get into the Brexit negotiations further, when those in Britain realise that they are leaving the European Union and the value an Irish passport will hold with regard to freedom of travel across the rest of the European Union and residence, we should prepare for the worst.  The applications of those who need passports to travel are being caught up in the system with those of others who are simply and understandably concerned about their travel rights within Europe at any time in the future.</p></speech>

This includes newer technology, new business processes, extra staff, improved service.  We also moved office.  This is medium-to-long-term planning in the Passport Office.  We have also taken steps to improve communications with citizens.</p>  <p>  Of course, the online application will considerably improve the situation.  Already, the online service has processed over 30,000 applications.  Public feedback has been positive.</p>  <p>  I recognise the challenge here.  I understand the frustration on the part of many citizens but I acknowledge that we are providing an important service, albeit under challenging circumstances.  I urge Deputies to encourage use of the online system as the default option for anybody renewing his or her passport.  The greater the uptake, the more resources that can be devoted to the more complex cases, such as first-time applicants, including first-time children applications, which take a bit of time.</p>  <p>  My advice, at the end of this question as at the commencement of the question, is to allow sufficient time, advise applicants to apply online and check their passport, particularly now as we are entering the holiday season.</p></speech>

A Programme for a Partnership Government makes specific reference to the Government's commitment to the establishment of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, placing the needs of victims and survivors at the core of these institutions.</p>  <p>  In pursuit of this, I participated for the Government in recent months in the currently paused talks process in Belfast, where a critical element is to achieve a way forward on the setting up of the Stormont House legacy framework.</p>  <p>  In the discussions on legacy issues, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>  <p>  The talks in Belfast will resume after the UK general election.</p>  <p>  In light of the speculation around the issue raised by the Deputy, it is worth stating clearly that there are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent agreement, including the Stormont House Agreement.  The Government would not look favourably on any proposal to introduce such a measure, for State or non-State actors.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s position is that the rule of law, including the requirement under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities.  In this regard, comments which effectively propose a selective approach to upholding the rule of law are not helpful.  I have made clear that the legacy process is not about seeking to find an artificial balance or equivalence in investigations but about ensuring we have a comprehensive approach.  That means looking at all Troubles related deaths, regardless of the affiliation of the perpetrators.</p></speech>

Those who remain without a voice, namely, the families of the victims, have an expectation that those elected to any parliament will respect the rule of law.  In response to concerns raised by the Pat Finucane Centre on behalf of the families, the Speaker's office confirmed that the House of Commons had a long-standing resolution that references should not be made in debates to cases which were active in the courts.  Does the Minister share my deep concerns about the underhand and devious attempts to undermine the rule of law and the independence of the prosecution service using the cover of parliamentary privilege?  The concern is that this will prejudice the trial process.  Does the Minister believe this is a crude attempt to try to collapse the trial process?  I am sure he is aware that this is the first of many similar cases.  The two cases involved go back 43 and 45 years, respectively.  Those involved have been waiting a long time for justice and should not have to deal with comments made in the House of Commons and the British tabloid media.</p></speech>

There is no provision in the Good Friday Agreement for an amnesty from prosecution and the Government would not look favourably on any proposal to introduce such a measure.  The rule of law, including the requirement for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities.  In this regard, it is important that, as soon as practicable after the UK general election, all parties in Northern Ireland, including Deputy Crowe's party, sit around the table and ensure we will have a functioning Executive and that the institutions will be up and running in Northern Ireland, as per the wishes of the people expressed as far back as 2 March.  It is regrettable that the parties have not reached agreement.  I assure all parties involved that my Government colleagues and I will ensure we will take our responsibilities, obligations and duties very seriously under the Good Friday Agreement, of which we are co-guarantors and subsequent agreements.  I look forward to a resumption of the talks, in a positive frame of mind, at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

My concern about this case is that it is a backdoor to providing immunity for British soldiers.  We know that throughout the history of the conflict only four British soldiers were convicted of shooting civilians while on duty  and that all four were freed within five years of beginning their life sentences through the use of the royal prerogative.  The families are concerned that this is an attempt to try to collapse the cases in an underhand and devious way.  They are also concerned because these are the first cases of many in a queue.  I ask the Minister to relay his concerns on this matter to his British counterpart and write to the new Speaker of the House of Commons about same following the general election.</p></speech>

I will also raise it with important elected representatives as soon as the talks get under way again.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the many men and women on both sides of the Border who performed their official duty to protect the public with honour, dedication and diligence throughout the Troubles.  Their service has not been and must not be forgotten.  There is no contradiction between this acknowledgement and the need for a clear-eyed holistic approach whereby wrongdoing and those responsible for such wrongdoing will be identified and pursued in accordance with the rule of law.

We must do all we can to protect it.  Our corporation tax rate should not and cannot be used as a stick with which to beat us in the negotiations ahead.

There have been over 400 such engagements with the 27 EU member states and institutions which included, most recently, the visit of the European Union&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, to Ireland.  The programme of engagements has been led by the Taoiseach, as well as my colleagues across government, complemented by official level meetings.  For my part, I have had nearly 100 engagements with my EU counterparts and the EU institutions.  A central goal of the engagement has been to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances in the context of Brexit are understood by our EU partners and to seek explicit recognition of these issues and priorities in the European Union&rsquo;s position for the withdrawal negotiations.  Throughout my engagement with partners I have emphasised the political imperative of achieving flexible and imaginative solutions in the context of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, in particular, with a view to avoiding a hard border.  In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  </p>  <p>  The EU guidelines adopted by the Taoiseach and his counterparts on 29 April fully take account of the Government&rsquo;s priority of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard border, as well as recognising bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including the common travel area.</p>  <p>  Neither Ireland&rsquo;s status of neutrality nor our corporation tax rate has been raised in any of my engagements with EU partners, or those of my officials, in the context of the European Union&rsquo;s negotiation guidelines and directives.  These are matters which have no bearing on the forthcoming negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  I have been struck by the very genuine level of engagement and understanding demonstrated by our EU partners of the significant political challenges Brexit poses for Ireland and, in particular, the peace process.  Finding solutions will be a challenging exercise, but my engagement with EU partners has left me fully confident that we can count on their support as we seek the right outcome for Ireland at the end of what will be a complex set of negotiations.</p></speech>

I am sure he will agree that our need to be able to determine our own tax rate is greater than ever, given that we will probably be most affected by Brexit.  It will potentially have a disproportionate effect on Ireland in comparison to other EU member states.  I tabled my question in the context of remarks made by the new French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron.  I congratulate him on his election, but during the election campaign he singled out Ireland's corporation tax rate and said he believed the gaps in taxation between member states needed to be closed.  There have been other similar signals, although perhaps they were only given in the context of an election campaign.  Does the Minister agree that our neutrality, our right to set our own rates of corporation or other taxes and the common travel area are red line issues for Ireland in the Brexit negotiations?</p></speech>

Tax rates remain within the exclusive competence of member states.  All member states are free to set their own corporation tax rate, as they see fit.  Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate has been a long-standing element of Government policy and remains the centrepiece of our competitive tax offering.</p><p> As I have said, the issue of Ireland's corporation tax rate has not been raised with me or any of my officials during our engagements with our EU partners on Brexit.  I have to acknowledge that during these engagements, our position has received a very positive reception from our EU colleagues.  There has been speculation about the UK's post-Brexit corporation tax plans.  It should be noted that the UK's intention to reduce its current 20% corporation tax rate to 17% by 2020 was announced well in advance of the Brexit vote.  I do not believe Brexit will have any impact on the UK's ability to set its own corporation tax rates, no more than it will have any impact - adverse or otherwise - on our ability to set our own corporation tax rate.</p></speech>

I wonder whether we have made it clear that we do not intend to move on these issues.  We are firmly on the EU side of the table in these negotiations.  The Minister has rightly mentioned that Britain intends to reduce its corporation tax rate to 17% by 2020.  It is not just our corporation tax that makes this country attractive for inward investment.  The most important factor is our educated workforce.  We have a track record and a reputation as a place where companies can do business and employ people.  I ask the Minister to keep it to the forefront of his mind that we cannot be complacent in this regard.  We do not know what his new boss will do.  I wish him well in that regard.  It is very important that Ireland does not take its eye off the ball in case some of our more jealous European partners see this as an opportunity to squeeze what they might see as some concessions from us in areas like neutrality, corporation tax and the common travel area.</p></speech>

We have made a reasonably positive start to these negotiations.  Our priorities have been included in the negotiating guidelines and in the commencement position of the British Government, as outlined in its White Paper and in the letters sent to the EU from Prime Minister May.  Ireland's long-standing policy of neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments, including one supported by Deputy O'Brien, is well known throughout the EU and Europe.  I do not believe there is any EU member state that is not fully <i>au fait</i>with our long-standing policy of military neutrality, which goes hand in hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhanced co-operation and reduced conflict throughout the world.  I am conscious of both issues raised by Deputy O'Brien.  I assure him and the House that we will continue to be mindful of our unique position regarding our rate of corporation tax and our long-standing policy of military neutrality.</p></speech>

Talks are now taking place between the prison authorities and the prisoners.  This is a victory, in a way, for the hunger strikers.</p></reply>

It is understood that a new arrangement for a second family visit per month, and possibly other understandings, was the basis for ending the strike.  The hunger strike by over 1,000 prisoners was a matter of great concern as it was entering its seventh week.  I am relieved that it has ended without tragedy.  We spoke directly about the need to avoid a tragic outcome with the Israeli ambassador and in other contacts with the Israeli authorities.  The EU missions in Palestine, including Ireland&rsquo;s mission in Ramallah, issued a public statement concerning the hunger strikes calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners.  A further EU statement at higher level was being prepared when the strike ended.</p>  <p>  I have said on the record that I do not believe there is any positive use of hunger strikes.  When we expressed the concern of the Irish Government, we had to be conscious that many prisoners, including some of those who were on hunger strike, have been convicted of serious and violent offences.  In addition, we were conscious that we could express similar or stronger concerns about prisoners in many other jurisdictions in the region, including Israel.  We raised this matter in a low-key way for two reasons.  First, we cannot support or encourage the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure.  I have rejected its use on numerous occasions internationally and I will continue to do so.  Second, we are aware from our own history of the real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to tragedy, and of the danger of hunger strikes leading to increased tensions and clashes on the streets.  We did not want to say anything that could add to that risk.  I will not comment on the specific issues raised by the strikers.  We have little detail on what has been agreed.  I reiterate that my essential position and that of the Irish Government is that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords to its own citizens when they are under detention.  Under international law, Palestinian prisoners should be held within their own territory.  In that context, I emphasise that when Palestinians are being held in Israel, special attention must be given to ensuring family visits are realistically facilitated.</p></speech>

I think the 1,500 prisoners in this case were driven to desperation.  Most of those who are in jail in Palestine are not even tried.  They are held after raids in the occupied West Bank as part of what is known as "administrative detention".  It is akin to the system of internment without trial that was in existence in the North some years ago.  At the end of April, the number of Palestinian prisoners stood at 6,100, some 300 of whom were children.  As the Minister has said, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners is much worse than the treatment of Israeli prisoners, even though many of them have not been convicted of anything.  For example, Palestinian prisoners have no access to phones, study or work.  The main demand of the hunger strikers was to be able to access phones to call their families.  Israel responded brutally, for example by transferring prisoners, placing prisoners in solitary confinement, blocking visits from lawyers and confiscating property.  It began a media offensive against a particular leading prisoner.  We have our own experience of hunger strikes in this country.  I think everyone should condemn the Israeli response in this case.</p></speech>

It should always be the case that prisoners receive such treatment.  Some of the other demands, such as those relating to prison conditions, seemed reasonable.  I do not really know all the circumstances, so I am not going to comment in any great detail.  Prison conditions in the Middle East generally are not the same as in Ireland or in Europe.  For these reasons, I do not wish to comment specifically on the demands which were made.  I stress the obvious principle that all Palestinian and Israeli prisoners should enjoy the same conditions and protections that Israel deems appropriate for its own citizens.</p></speech>

We should be calling for an end to arbitrary arrests by the Israeli authorities.  In most cases, it is utterly illegal for people to be held without trial.  Military raids on homes, dozens of which take place routinely, need to be brought to an end.  I commend the Israeli Medical Association - the doctors' trade union - for refusing to take part in the force-feeding of hunger strikers.  This made it difficult for the Israeli Government to implement force-feeding as a threat.  I support utterly the demands of prisoners for access to education, communication and family visits.  We need to end the occupation and the military courts that are in place in the Occupied Territories.  All political prisoners should be released.  The Government's position should be to support those basic demands loudly and clearly.</p></speech>

My understanding is that this law has not been used to date.  I am also aware that the Israeli doctors' organisation has stated that its members will not participate in force feeding.  Fears that have been expressed about the use of force feeding have thus far not been borne out, but I want to avail of the opportunity here, in response to Deputy Coppinger, to say that I would consider the use of force feeding in the circumstances to be unacceptable.</p></speech>

The US, as with all other states, is required to provide my Department with confirmation in writing that the aircraft proposing to land in Shannon comply with the strict conditions as set out and as I have mentioned.</p><p>Thorough and robust procedures are in place in my Department with a view towards ensuring that the conditions for securing permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State are clearly understood and properly applied now and into the future.  These procedures are kept under ongoing review.  Comprehensive records on requests received and decisions made are retained for the purposes of monitoring and oversight and are drawn on as needed to provide information to this House as appropriate.</p></speech>

My question asks him to specify the robust procedures that are in place to ensure that the conditions are met.  Telling me that a letter of request and a reply is the same as a robust procedure is simply not acceptable.  We, as a neutral country, are now complicit in wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and so on.  The death rate is appalling.  If we look at Yemen alone, where a military raid was ordered by President Trump over dinner, 23 civilians were killed in that raid, including ten children aged 12 and under, an 80 year old man and several women.  That was called a win by President Trump, although his senior officials have since confirmed that it was a mistake and that it was wrong.  In Yemen, 19 million of the total 28 million population are in need of humanitarian aid, and one child under five dies every ten minutes from preventable diseases.  We are complicit in that war and in this slaughter.  I again put that simple question to the Minister.  If his answer is that we are relying on assurances, I will take that, but I ask him please to spell it out for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000025#Y00600"><p>I reject what the Deputy has said about our military neutrality.  The practical implementation of the conditions for granting permission for landings is guided by and reflects Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, to which the Government remains fully committed.  The statement of foreign policy entitled "A Global Island" approved by the Government in January 2015 clearly states that our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy.  This policy goes hand in hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhance co-operation and to reduce conflict in the world.</p>  <p>  I assure the House and the Deputy that prior permission is required for all foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports and permission, if granted, is subject to strict conditions.  In accordance, with international practice, foreign military aircraft which are granted permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection.  Sovereign immunity, a long-standing principle of customary international law, means that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in respect of another state and its property, including state or military aircraft.  This principle applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft in the same way as it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad.  This is not a specific issue in regard to the United States; this is in regard to all foreign military aircraft landing at Irish airports.</p></speech>

Prior to that there were also the most serious breaches under the previous regime.  The Minister is telling me that he is relying on reassurances.  The lack of evidence has been raised in various court cases and those brave people who protest on a regular basis have been told to go and collect evidence.  The word "protest" is wrong; rather they highlight and raise awareness about what is happening down in Shannon.</p>  <p>  More than 3 million American troops have gone through Shannon based on reassurances from them that they are carrying no arms.  They are going through Shannon to refuel in order to wage war in countries that are innumerable at this point and the loss of life is appalling.  We have a duty to live up to our neutrality and the Minister is simply not doing that and neither is the Government.</p></speech>

In considering requests for landings by foreign military aircraft, my Department's focus is on ensuring that the information provided with regard to flights and aircraft demonstrates that they comply with the conditions as applicable.  Matters such as the times at which landings take place are operational ones for the pilot or pilots in consultation with the airport in question.  They do not affect the decision on whether the aircraft meets the strictest conditions which the Department has laid down.  Officials in my Department are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to process any requests received and to maintain ongoing contact with embassies, particularly from those from which, by reason of geography, we receive the most applications.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House again that Ireland's traditional and longstanding policy of military neutrality, which I am pleased is the stated policy of all parties in the House, is in no way adversely affected or threatened.  The practical implementation of the conditions reflects Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  The Government firmly remains committed to that policy.</p></speech>

The people whom I have the privilege of representing in two of the southern Ulster counties will not countenance a return to the imposition of the restrictions we had in the past on the movement of people, goods or services.  Has the Minister had any contact or discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since the commencement of the British general election campaign?  The Secretary of State is in the very fine position in political life of having a safe majority of 16,000 so he is not under considerable pressure during an election campaign.  I hope that he has been giving some time to the urgent need to have the Northern Ireland institutions restored and also to have ongoing contact and work done in the context of Brexit and particularly as it will affect our island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000026#Z00100"><p>I have spoken directly with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, since the campaign in the UK commenced some weeks ago.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the avoidance of a hard Border on the island of Ireland and the maintenance of the common travel area are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s priorities in the EU-UK negotiations.  As a symbol of and a dividend from the peace process, an open Border is essential to the social and economic fabric on the island and to the continuing normalisation of relationships that has been facilitated by the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is clear that the withdrawal agreement should create no impediment to the free movement of people on the island and should create no circumstance where the normalisation of peoples' lives that has accompanied the peace process is undermined.</p>  <p>  The avoidance of a hard Border on the island of Ireland is a shared objective of the Irish and British Governments and our EU partners.  This has been confirmed by Secretary of State Brokenshire and British Prime Minister May on her visit to Dublin earlier this year.  It has also been confirmed by the European Council.  The EU negotiation guidelines contain a very strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances, including the need to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  The negotiating directives for the task force, adopted by the General Affairs Council on 22 May, fully reflect this acknowledgement.  The European Parliament has also recognised the need to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland in a resolution supported by virtually all the main European political groups.</p>  <p>  The UK Government notification letter, which formally triggered Article 50, placed a strong emphasis on the "unique relationship" between these two islands.  The letter confirmed that the UK Government wishes to avoid a return to a hard Border, to maintain the common travel area and to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.  As laid out in the negotiating guidelines, the avoidance of a hard Border will require flexibility and creativity on the part of both the United Kingdom and the European Union.  Ireland has made clear its expectation that there will need to be a political solution and not just a legal or a technical solution, given this represents a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances.  Achieving this objective will not be easy and compromises will be required by both the UK and the European Union, in order to find a solution that realises the shared objective of avoiding a hard Border, and one which protects Ireland&rsquo;s obligations, interests and advantages as a continuing and committed member of the EU 27.</p>  <p>  The maintenance of the common travel area following the UK withdrawal from the EU is a priority for both the Irish and UK Governments.  The common travel area predates Irish and UK membership of the European Union and is not dependent on EU membership.  The common travel area is particularly important in underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process and relations on the island of Ireland, and it has been acknowledged by our EU partners in the negotiation guidelines and directives.</p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the discussions following the Assembly elections, I strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland's interests can be effectively represented as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations.  Additionally, I have been in frequent contact with all my EU counterparts, including my British counterparts, approaching 80 engagements over the past ten months.  In the negotiations, which will commence after the British general election, the Government will pursue an outcome that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including avoidance of a hard Border and the maintenance of the common travel area.  We are not under any illusions about the challenge and complexity of these negotiations and have engaged in detailed and ongoing planning in order to prepare for them.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy represents a Border area, I assure the House that whether before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence or in the course of plenary session of the House, I at all times welcome the observations of Deputy Smith on issues concerning the Border area.  I look forward to the House fully engaging once the negotiations commence.</p></speech>

I do not for one second doubt the Minister's absolute commitment and hard work in this area.  I sincerely hope that work will continue into the future.  The Minister basically outlined again what we discussed at our meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence last week and we will have another meeting during the course of next month specifically devoted to Brexit.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  Apart from that, there have been some unwelcome developments over the past few weeks from the Conservative Party in Britain.  It has made several statements that, while not directly challenging the common travel area by name, undermine it by implication.  I refer to a tweet from the Conservative Party that states "Brexit gives us an opportunity to get control of our borders but only if we get the negotiations right.".  Broad and sweeping statements like this from the Tories are sending mixed signals, as many commentators see a clear and glaring conflict between the absolute commitment to "control our borders" while also supporting the common travel area, as EU citizens have the right to travel to Ireland.  What is worrying is that the Secretary of State's party - the Tory Party - is more firmly committed to controlling the borders than positively maintaining the common travel area in its current operations.  The Minister knows that with the common travel area we have heard references from British Government Ministers and others to keep it "as frictionless as possible" with "no return to borders of the past".  Has the Secretary of State or the British Head of Government given to the Minister or the Taoiseach any indication of what is meant by those phrases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000026#Z00300"><p>Avoiding a hard Border on the island of Ireland, with the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in its entirety, remains an absolute priority for this Government.  This is a position that has been well heard and is well understood right across the European Union.  I am pleased to say it has been expressly reflected in the negotiating guidelines.  As set out in the guidelines, imaginative and flexible solutions will be required.  Our absolute priority and preference is to maintain the closest possible trading relationship, based on a level playing field, between the UK and the European Union, including Ireland.  There is much negotiation yet to be done around trading arrangements, and by extension, any customs regime that might apply.</p>  <p>  It is premature to set out detailed possible solutions, in particular when the negotiations have yet to properly begin.  However, it is important that technical solutions do not anticipate or drive outcomes at political level.  I agree with Deputy Smith.  There has been an extensive level of engagement with and by our EU partners to understand this issue.  Ireland will continue to work with the task force and our EU partners to find solutions in line with our commitment to the integrity of the Single Market but the UK has its own responsibilities.  It will need to show with its actions the commitment to the stated objective of protecting the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard Border.</p></speech>

The Tory manifesto put before the electorate contains a rather vague commitment with respect to the Northern Ireland position.  It states: "As we leave the European Union, we recognise Northern Ireland's unique circumstances and will seek to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected."  The phrase "will seek to" does not reassure any of us, and I am sure it does not reassure the Minister.  The Minister may not have had the opportunity to ask the Secretary of State what his party and Government mean with that phrase.  I suggest to the Minister that with the negotiations taking place with the new British Government, the Irish people would want to know as soon as possible what is meant by "as frictionless" a Border as possible and the meaning of "no return to the borders of the past".  Will the Minister ensure that at an early stage in the negotiations with the new British Government, he will be able to give the people I represent and all those on this island a commitment that there will be no return or impediments in any way for people travelling North or South or anywhere within the island following Brexit?  We need a clear message for the people of this island that there will be no countenance of a return to the impositions on travel, whether affecting people, goods or services.</p></speech>

In this regard, let me repeat that Ireland, in conjunction with and as a member of the EU 27, is pleased so far that our EU colleagues have recognised fully the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.</p><p>However, as I said earlier, the UK also has its responsibilities and will need to come to the table with an open mind and show by its actions its commitment to its stated objective of protecting the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and the maintenance of an open Border.  It is premature to begin setting out in detail possible solutions.  I expect the negotiations will commence shortly after the conclusion of the British general election on 8 June.  Ireland will work with the task force and our EU partners to find solutions in line with our commitment to the integrity of the Single Market, our priorities being the maintenance of the open Border and the full protection of the common travel area in line with our commitments, obligations and duties under the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.</p></speech>

That is the message we need to get out to the electorate here, that our Government and its European counterparts will ensure we will not have meaningless phrases from the Head of the British Government or other members of that Government or at official level.  This is the last Question Time we will have before the British general election and the resumption of talks on the need to have the Northern Ireland institutions restored.  There is a huge urgency, as we all know, in ensuring that the Northern Ireland institutions are restored.  They are critical to ensure we have the outcome to the Brexit negotiations that we all want and to try to limit the damage as much as possible to all of this island.  I appeal to the Minister again to ensure that at Government level, after the formation of the new British Government, he repeats again the need for the British Government to show its commitment early on and to show clarity regarding what it would see as the arrangements that will exist between this island and Britain post-2019.</p></speech>

First, regarding the Northern Ireland Executive, on behalf of the Irish Government, I look forward to being in Stormont on or around Monday, 12 June, in order to ensure there will be an appropriate level of momentum in the talks.  There has not been a functioning executive in Northern Ireland this year.  I believe it is long overdue and I believe there is a role and function particularly for the parties that have been elected to the Assembly to ensure we have a full work-out of the institutions.  I believe that with the appropriate level of political will, that can happen before the statutory deadline of 29 June.</p>  <p>  Regarding the second point, I reassure Deputy Smith that the Government has made clear our commitment to minimise the impact of Brexit on the Border region in particular.  I do not accept what the British Prime Minister repeated again last night, that no deal is better than a bad deal.  I believe it is fundamental to the process that both the European Union, of which Ireland will continue to be a member, and the UK negotiating team come to the table in a spirit of goodwill in order to do a deal.  We are committed to ensuring that there will be no impediment to movement on the island of Ireland and that the withdrawal agreement will in no way create circumstances which will undermine the peace process and the normalisation it has brought to people's lives, as the Deputies, particularly those from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, will be aware.</p></speech>

I reiterate the points I made in response to the previous question asked by Deputy Smith.  My expectation is that these negotiations will commence in June.  It is absolutely essential that both parties - the EU, including Ireland, and the UK - address these negotiations in a spirit of compromise but also of goodwill and constructive engagement.  The negotiating guidelines make reference to Gibraltar within the context of the framework of the future EU-UK relationship, which is the subject of a separate negotiation.  This is entirely distinct and separate from the Irish Government's priority, which is to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement, are recognised.  The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty registered with the United Nations, and this is a key distinguishing factor of our unique position in Ireland.  It is important to note that any future trade deal between the European Union and the UK is likely to have to be ratified by national parliaments as well as the EU institutions.  This is where the European Parliament has a role to play along with the leading role of the EU Council, comprising the heads of state or government of the member states.  It is important to note that these negotiations will not be concluded in their entirety until such time as there is a trade deal between the European Union and the UK.  Any trade deal will, in all likelihood, have to be ratified by national parliaments, including Ireland's.</p></speech>

At this stage it is too early to speculate on any detail of the negotiations, but I encourage the European Union, including Ireland, to approach these negotiations with a view towards concluding a deal.  Our wish and priority is that there will be as close as possible a relationship, ultimately, between the departing UK as a former member of the European Union and the remaining EU 27.  This is why I do not agree with or subscribe to the view that no deal is better than a bad deal.  I believe it is important that everyone approach these negotiations with a view towards reaching a deal in what will be a very difficult and challenging environment.  No EU member has ever left the Union, which is why detailed negotiations over a period of two years or more need to be approached in as constructive a way as possible in order ultimately to give rise to an agreement on the part of EU heads of state and government which will be ratified by the European Parliament.</p></speech>

It is a factual question about the rules regarding the final, final negotiation when the UK chooses to leave.  This is important in the context of recent statements - as recently as last night - by the British Prime Minister that no deal and a simple exit would be better than a bad Brexit.  This has profound implications.  In a certain sense, I do not think we wish to see this happen.  We do not wish to see Britain leave the EU at all, but Britain seems set on its particular course, and last night the Prime Minister reiterated again, admittedly in the context of a general election, that no deal is better than a bad deal.  Therefore, when it comes to the final, final stage, which we have been told many times by the Taoiseach will be for the heads of state after all the different institutions and so on have had their say and their participation, will the decision be made by qualified majority voting, as has been suggested, or will Ireland as a country have a veto?</p></speech>

Any form of side negotiations between Ireland and the UK or any bilateral arrangements would, given the circumstances, be unhelpful.  We are firmly on the side of the solidarity and support we have received from our EU partners.  We are approaching the negotiations in a positive frame of mind and urge the United Kingdom to do so in a similar fashion.</p></speech>

The judgment upheld the validity of the EU association agreement with Morocco, but stipulated that it does not apply to the territory of Western Sahara.  Ireland has a long-standing position in support of the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p><p>As a matter of practicality, almost all goods from Western Sahara are likely to be exported to, or via, Morocco.  It would not be in the interests of the farmers, fishermen and other producers of Western Sahara wishing to sell their goods abroad if they were to be prevented from doing so due to the territory&rsquo;s disputed status.  However, the court has made clear that in order for the association agreement and related protocols to apply to Western Sahara, the consent of the people of Western Sahara will first be required. </p><p>The<b></b>possible renegotiation of the association agreement, or modification of its protocols to provide for treatment of goods coming from Western Sahara, is currently under discussion at EU level.  Given the circumstances, this is obviously a complex issue which will involve finding a way of reconciling practical<b></b>issues such as certifying the origin of goods and the monitoring of implementation, with matters of principle relating to the consent of the people of Western Sahara.  Any agreement entered into by the EU will have to be consistent with EU law, including the court&rsquo;s judgment of 21 December 2016.</p></speech>

People said it was not a concern at all and so on.  Clearly, the European Court of Justice has difficulties with the agreement.  It involves the issue of consent.  My concern is that unless we talk to those who represent the people of Western Sahara we will be going down the same road.  My concern is that the Commission is trying to rebrand the same agreement.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister confirm that the Government will block any attempts by the European Commission to negotiate exclusively with Morocco and ignore the only legitimate and UN recognised representatives of the people of Western Sahara mainly the Polisario Front?  It seems obvious to me that the EU and the European Commission must speak to the Polisario Front urgently in order to find a viable solution and address the status of European companies and goods exported from Western Sahara.  What different approach will Ireland be taking following the European Court of Justice judgment?</p></speech>

Ireland, as I have said, supports the right of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.  We do not have a view on the outcome of the court's decision, be it independence, integration, autonomy or some other legal or constitutional framework, as long as it is decided in what must be a genuine exercise in self-determination.</p>  <p>  We have taken careful note of the court's decision of last December which upheld the validity of the EU's association agreement with Morocco.  It stipulated that it does not apply to the territory of Western Sahara.  Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware, has a long-standing position in support of the right of self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  These are complex issues and a resolution will take some time.  For example, the agreement on agricultural products was negotiated and agreed in the agriculture working group at the Agriculture Council.  That was within the framework of the EU-Morocco association agreement that entered into force some 17 years ago.  It was ratified by all EU member states, including Ireland.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to express an interest in this area and, ultimately, the issue will be a matter for the people of Western Sahara.</p></speech>

Would the Minister not accept that it is completely unacceptable that the Moroccans continue to export products from Western Sahara into the EU, as they did before the ruling of the European Court of Justice?</p>  <p>  There are two cases pending before the European Court of Justice regarding the EU-Morocco fisheries partnership agreement.  The agreement secures EU fishing rights in Moroccan and Western Saharan waters in exchange for Morocco receiving &euro;40 million annually, nearly half of which was supposed to be spent on developing the fishing industry in Morocco.</p>  <p>  The EU approved funding of specific projects, including projects in Western Sahara.  This means that Brussels is directly assisting the Moroccan Government in developing its infrastructure in a territory that, according to the European Court of Justice, lies outside of Morocco's internationally recognised borders.  Would the Minister not agree that this is wrong and should stop?</p></speech>

One of the key moves we could make is to get our European Union colleagues to start monitoring his case and show a real interest in it.  We made that case to the European delegation when we were in Cairo.  We were led to understand that one or two countries, in particular Greece, were against such a move.

I wish to assure Deputy Ryan that this remains a priority consular case in my Department.  We are now running at just under 3,000 consular cases per annum.  I can say without a shadow of doubt or fear of contradiction that this is the case that is receiving the most priority in terms of resources and interest.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned about the ongoing situation.  Since the last adjournment of the case, I have had the opportunity to raise the issue directly with a number of my EU colleagues in Brussels, in particular the High Representative Foreign Affairs Council Chair, Frederica Mogherini.  I have raised this issue consistently with her over the past number of years and I know she has raised the issue directly the Egyptian Government.</p><p>I also raised the issue as recently as last Monday week with a number of EU Foreign Ministers, in particular my colleague, Mr. Jean Asselborn, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg and dean, or senior member, of the Foreign Affairs Council.  I have also had the opportunity on a number of recent occasions to raise the issue with senior Members of the European Parliament which has adopted a resolution on this matter.</p> <p> I am very concerned at the delay in bringing this trial to a conclusion.  I acknowledge, however, that there was an element of progress at the last two hearings.  Witnesses are being called, evidence is being heard and the case is proceeding.  I regret that the next return date is not until July but I note that courts do not sit in Egypt during the Ramadan period.  I look forward to an early conclusion of the case and assure the Deputy that I remain very active in relation to it.</p></speech>

Something needs to change.  While the Minister says there has at least been some progress, there is no sign of this court case coming to an end.  It is a mass trial of 480 people, including one European citizen from this State.  Why is the European Commission delegation in Cairo not monitoring the case given that this is a European citizen?  What has the Minister done specifically to change that so European Union monitoring takes place and the Egyptian Government knows that it is not just the Irish Government but the whole European Union which finds this situation intolerable?  What has the Minister done to get EU monitoring of the case and why has it not happened?  Our parliamentary delegation to Cairo could not have made it more plain to the European Commission that we wanted that monitoring to happen.  It was one of the most heightened exchanges of our visit but nothing has happened since.  What is the Minister going to do to effect that one lever over which we at least have some control rather than to say there is some progress and that some witnesses have been heard?  Why is the European Union not in that court to see what is going on and to represent the European and Irish citizen in the case?</p></speech>

The trial is proceeding.  I regret, however, that it has not yet concluded.  I assure the Deputy that the European Union has been a strong ally of Ireland on this matter.  I refer to my representations to Federica Mogherini and her role, in particular, as well as that of her colleagues in the Commission who have advocated strongly and consistently on our behalf with the Egyptian Government.</p>  <p>  We have been pursuing the question of EU trial monitoring at local level in Cairo.  This requires consensus among all member states represented in Egypt.  I admit that such consensus does not exist currently but we are continuing to follow up actively on the matter.  We have made representations to a number of EU member state governments and continue to work to achieve a consensus on the issue.  As the Deputy will be aware and as I assure him again, this is the No. 1 priority consular case in my Department.  We will continue to actively engage on the issue until such time as our Irish citizen is released and home with his family to resume his studies here in the city of Dublin.</p></speech>

He has not answered the question.  I may be wrong and I do not want to defame any particular country, but I understand that one of the obstacles to consensus is opposition from the Greek Government to such monitoring.  Whatever about the Minister's meetings with Madame Mogherini and the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, what specific communication has he had with the Greek Government to overcome that key blockage to get EU monitoring of the case and increase the pressure on the Egyptian judicial system?  Surely, we have the right to do that at this stage because our European citizen is stuck for the 24th time going to court without any case being heard or concluded in a mass trial of 480 people.  What specifically has the Minister done with the Greek Government to overcome that block and does he believe there will be European monitoring of the case when it returns in July?</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy in the meantime, however, the Irish Government and our representative in Cairo continue to be actively engaged and to attend at each and every one of the hearings to date.  While we await the conclusion of the trial, I assure the House that every effort is being made to secure the health and welfare of our citizen while he remains on remand.  The Government's strategy is under continuous review.  We have engaged in continuous and constant consultation with the family of Ibrahim Halawa, the lawyers acting on his behalf here in Ireland and in Egypt, experts from civil society and NGOs which have shown an interest in the case.  As I have said before, if any Member of the House believes he or she can be of any assistance, I am happy to speak to him or her.  My officials have offered to brief any Member who wishes to discuss the case.</p>  <p>  This is an extremely complex case as the Deputy will have seen on his visit to Cairo.  This is not something which can be dealt with satisfactorily, positively or conclusively by, as has rather glibly been said, lifting the phone.  This complex case is receiving very significant attention and resources in my Department.  Resources have also been applied from the Department of the Taoiseach and members of the Government will continue to actively engage until the matter is finally dealt with.</p></speech>

Conflict, drought, severe food insecurity and now famine are causing massive population displacements and suffering throughout the region.  As a consequence, the humanitarian situation is continuing to deteriorate and 5 million people are classified as severely food insecure in South Sudan.  Famine is affecting 100,000 people in parts of the country and a further 1 million people are now on the brink of famine.  In Somalia, 3.2 million people are in crisis and the risk of famine remains extremely high.  Over 10 million people in Ethiopia and Kenya are also now facing an acute hunger crisis.  As such, the continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance to avert a catastrophe in the region is essential.</p>  <p>  Through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland has provided &euro;120 million in humanitarian assistance in the Horn region since 2012, including &euro;29 million in 2016 and &euro;17 million so far this year.  Our assistance is supporting our UN and NGO partners in their responses with a focus on providing food assistance, treating malnutrition, providing shelter and protection for displaced people, and providing emergency services in water, sanitation and health care.  Last month, we airlifted over 100 tonnes of emergency relief supplies to Somalia while earlier this month a further 34 tonnes were airlifted to South Sudan for distribution to displaced families.  We will continue to monitor this ongoing crisis closely and to provide additional life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need.</p></reply>

It is of vital importance.  Is the Minister aware also of the unfolding political crisis and the impact it is having on aid agencies?  Aid agencies are now being targeted by some of the political actors in the region which is making it very difficult to carry out humanitarian work.</p><p>With the humanitarian crisis, there is breakdown in civil society and some of the official and unofficial bodies in the region are acting against the humanitarian agencies.  We have embassies in Ethiopia and Kenya.  What are we doing on the diplomatic front to try to ensure respect is given to aid agencies to allow them assist people without fear of attack?</p></speech>

This is coupled with conflict and violence, as the Deputy has said, with particular reference to Al-Shabaab's insurgency.  Inter-clan fighting has led to a very worrying deteriorating situation in Somalia and other countries in the region.  Ireland's response is, in the main, by way of humanitarian assistance.  This is delivered on the ground by our partners, in particular the UN Refugee Agency and the World Food Programme.  Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the programme's headquarters in Rome, where I saw the great work done by everybody there, in particular scores of young Irish participants.  I acknowledge the work of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the UN Children's Fund, the International Red Cross, the International Red Crescent and non-governmental organisations, in particular, Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam Ireland, World Vision Ireland, Plan Ireland and Christian Aid.  These NGOs have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable of communities.  Our partners, in particular, the International Committee of the Red Cross, are best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and gain access to areas where other organisations are unable to operate, such as Syria, Iraq and South Sudan.  I share the Deputy's concern.  This is a real and serious challenge.</p></speech>

It is unusual that they are becoming targets and this needs diplomatic intervention.</p></speech>

In the course of my earlier responses, I dwelt, in particular, on the humanitarian aid and assistance to which Ireland has been to the fore in contributing.  We are very concerned about the unprecedented level of humanitarian need globally and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in many parts of the world.  In respect of assistance towards the resolution of conflict, the international community, including the European Union, continues to strongly support the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region.  Those with influence on warring parties must bring it to bear on those involved in conflict and those in search of peace because without peace needs will continue to rise and millions more will suffer from acute hunger and famine.  In addition to seeking political solutions, we must also urge respect for international humanitarian law so in the interim period humanitarian assistance can reach those in need.  We must urgently scale up our humanitarian assistance to help those now on the brink of famine to avoid catastrophe, and encourage other donors to step up their assistance.  I am proud of the response of Ireland in this regard.</p></speech>

It is understood a new arrangement for a second family visit per month, and possibly other understandings, were the basis for ending the strike.</p>  <p>  As the hunger strike by more than 1,000 prisoners was entering its seventh week it was a matter of great concern, and I am relieved that it has been ended without death or tragedy.</p>  <p>  We had spoken directly about the need to avoid a tragic outcome with the Israeli ambassador and in other contacts with the Israeli authorities.  The EU missions in Palestine, including Ireland&rsquo;s mission in Ramallah, issued a public statement concerning the hunger strikes, calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners.  A further EU statement at higher level was being prepared when word came through of the ending of the hunger strike.</p>  <p>  In expressing our concerns, I want to make clear we had to be conscious that many prisoners, including some of those on hunger strike, had been convicted of very serious and most violent offences, and that we could express similar or stronger concerns about prisoners in many other jurisdictions in the region, as well as in Israel.</p>  <p>  We raised this matter in a rather low-key way for two reasons, namely, as I made quite clear earlier, we cannot support or encourage the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure and we are aware from our own history of the real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to death and tragedy, and the danger of a hunger strike leading to increased tensions and clashes on the streets.  We did not want to say anything that might increase the risk.</p>  <p>  I will not comment any further on specific issues raised by the strikers.  I have little detail on what has been agreed.  However, I will state Ireland's essential position was that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens when detained.</p></speech>

I listened to his earlier reply.  I also welcome the fact there has been resolution.  The question has to be asked why do these men and women feel the need to go on hunger strike and take such a drastic decision, which could have had very serious repercussions on their health and lives if it had continued.  When I saw what they achieved by going on hunger strike I asked myself whether that was all they were looking for.  They were very basic rights, which other people would take for granted.  Prisoners have human rights, and international human rights law guarantees them basic human rights, such as freedom from torture and freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  What they achieved was very simple, including landlines in prison, better health care, which one would assume would be taken for granted, and more regular family visits.  There is a need to respect the rights of prisoners, regardless of where they are, and there are concerns about increasing use of solitary confinement.</p></speech>

Under international law, it is fair to say Palestinian prisoners should be held in their own territory.  After 50 years of occupation, there is not much of an excuse for failing to have adequate detention facilities in the occupied territory.  I understand holding prisoners in Israel creates difficulty for family visitors, given how difficult and onerous it is for Palestinians to cross into Israel.  For as long as prisoners are held in Israel, appropriate and expeditious arrangements should be made to facilitate family visits under reasonable conditions.  I understand this has been part of the agreement reached with the prisoners to facilitate their ending of the hunger strike.  However, there are no circumstances in which I would condone the use of hunger strikes to exert pressure or increase demands.</p></speech>

I raised this matter previously in a Topical Issue Debate and I was told at the time that action would be taken.  Since then, I must admit that some action was taken.  I thank the Taoiseach for his particular interest in the case which I raised that day.</p>  <p>  However, the same individuals are now causing the same difficulties with businesses, by entering the business, practice or the farm and treating the individuals as if they were criminals and as if a decision had already been made on their case.  Actions such as people taking a particular medication from a vehicle, entering an office and taking papers, not explaining who they represent and essentially taking the law into their own hands and treating people very badly comprise the general complaint I am receiving.  On the last occasion that I mentioned a case, it was dealt with.  It is unusual that the case brought to my attention recently is one in which an individual, who at that time was asked to present himself as a witness and refused to do so on the basis that he had nothing to do with that case, is now being investigated by the Department and being treated like a criminal.  Before the case is even heard he is now asked to answer a fitness to practise complaint from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  An individual in this State is innocent until proven guilty.  Surely the Department must go through a process to find out the extent of the wrongdoing or non-compliance with a regulation before it goes anywhere else.  That is the least one would expect, but that is not happening in this case.  I believe it is not happening due to the fact that he refused not so much to co-operate but to support a story, which was untrue, of another veterinarian on another occasion.  Protocols and regulations must be put in place to ensure that this does not happen and to ensure an innocent individual, who has not been convicted anywhere, is treated fairly.  The leaks from the Department to the media about these cases must be stopped.  They are putting jobs in the country at risk as well as the reputation of an individual or individuals who have never been convicted and have yet to go through the process.  The Department is using the might of its legal arm and taxpayers' money to chase down those people, break them before they go into court and have their reputations and businesses ruined.</p>  <p>  There was a case in which Judge Reynolds made certain references to individuals.  That type of case still occurs.  I am aware of one such case.  It is really offensive that the State would ruin a person's life and business without first going to the courts and finding out the facts.  I also believe the might of the State's legal arm and taxpayers' money should not be used to force an individual into a position where they must accept something that they believe they are innocent of, because they cannot afford, on either a reputation or financial basis, to go through the courts.  It is unacceptable.</p></speech>

Officials in my Department carry out a significant range of on-farm inspections annually for the various EU funded schemes and other sector-specific requirements.  Inspections are also carried out on commercial producers, wholesale and retail outlets, meat plants, milk processing facilities and forestry nurseries.  Veterinary related controls cover a wide range of regulatory activity including animal health, animal welfare, veterinary medicines, animal identification and registration, animal movement, fallen stock and animal by-products and public health.</p>  <p>  The EU regulation governing the various area-based direct payment schemes and rural development measures requires my Department to carry out on-the-spot inspections annually to ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria of the various schemes.  Inspections are also required to ensure compliance with cross-compliance requirements, as set down in EU legislation, and the standards for good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.  These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  These EU funded schemes are worth approximately &euro;1.5 billion annually to farmers.  Inspecting officers undergo regular training on the procedures for inspections and carry out inspections in accordance with the EU regulations.  Procedures and guidance documents issue to all officers.  Inspections are subject to supervisory and performance checks to ensure accuracy and consistency.</p>  <p>  There is a comprehensive review and appeal system in place for applicants if they consider that inspections are not conducted in accordance with legislative requirements or if they are unhappy with the inspection findings.  This incorporates an internal review process and the option to appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent agriculture appeals office.  In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome he or she may pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  As indicated, controls by veterinary personnel and other departmental officials cover a broad range of areas including animal health, animal welfare, veterinary medicines, animal identification and registration, animal movement, fallen stock, animal by-products and public health.  Each of the inspections is carried out using standardised forms and reporting arrangements with a system of oversight by line managers, fulfilling requirements relating to EU or national legislation.  Officials from the investigation division of my Department conduct a small number of investigations where serious non-compliance is suspected.  At the end of the investigation, the evidence is assessed to determine if the matter is to be prosecuted.  In such cases, a file is prepared and sent to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for assessment and, if appropriate, the commencement of the prosecution process.</p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with EU and national legislation requirements on inspections, the Charter of Farmers' Rights agreed between my Department and the various farming organisations sets out commitments relating to inspections.  Compliance by Department officials with these commitments is reviewed regularly by the independently chaired farmers' charter monitoring committee.  My Department has a customer complaints procedure which allows an individual to have their case examined.  All complaints are investigated thoroughly.  This procedure involves a three step process and if the complainant is still not satisfied with the response it is open to them to contact the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that the various inspection regimes operated by officials of my Department are implemented in accordance with EU and national legislation governing these requirements.  The inspection regimes are subject to audit by various EU, national and certifying bodies to ensure compliance with the requirements.  Furthermore, inspections and investigations are carried out in line with the principles of the farmers' charter, including that of treating everyone properly, fairly, impartially and with courtesy.</p>  <p>  Finally, officials in my Department, including all inspecting officers, are required to comply with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2011 and, where applicable, complete an annual statement of interest.</p></speech>

Due procedure was not followed and the individual veterinarian is almost guilty before he is taken through the process.  Surely the Minister can intervene to insist that justice be done and that the regulations and process be adhered to.  I ask him to do that.  I gave him the details of the case last week.  I stress the fact that because of what happened historically this individual is now caught up in the antics of a veterinarian from the Department, which is carrying out an investigation that does not comply with any standards at all.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, what action can the Minister take against a veterinarian within the Department who is breaking the law by providing unlabelled bottles for intravenous medication and so forth?  Who monitors that?  What action will the Minister take on the case I outlined to him to prevent further damage to the business concerned and to ensure that everything is done in accordance with best practice?  That includes the leaking of information to the media to blacken a person's name.  There were two cases, the Fannin and Farrell cases, before the courts and they were dealt with but the Department never came back to the people to pay what it should have paid.  It never addressed the Judge Reynolds judgment.</p><p>Now the same thing is happening again.  Veterinarians within the Department are doing what they like to individuals, going into offices and taking paperwork.  In the case in question, the secretary left.  In the previous case, it was a pregnant woman in the office whom they offended.  They would not comply with the requirements of the Garda either.  Something has to be done to stop the individual concerned from doing what is going on in Kilkenny.</p></speech>

I am not aware of the contact point for the stories in question.  Leaks make cases that are difficult more difficult to adjudicate on in a fair and impartial manner.</p><p>On the specific case to which the Deputy is alluding but not referencing, which I appreciate, he will appreciate the <i>sub judice</i>rule.  He will also appreciate that I cannot comment on a specific instance because the case is listed before the courts.  I assure him, however, that for officers of my Department involved in inspections across a range of activities, including veterinary and other inspectors, there is a code of practice which is framed within the context of EU and domestic legislation.  The code which has been in place since 2004 is under review.  I hope all those employed in my Department carry out their duties in accordance with it.  I refer, in particular, to the obligation to be civil and courteous to those under investigation or subject to spot checks.  In recent days the Deputy furnished me with the details of a specific case, about which I am inquiring further in my Department.  It would not be appropriate at this stage, therefore, to comment further on the matter.</p></speech>

I commend Dr. Geoffrey Shannon for the audit he conducted and also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for requesting it.  The findings are absolutely shocking and horrifying, to say the very least.  We are not talking about historical cases but about the current context.  We are talking about cases dating from 2014 and 2015 which are now before us.  In 2012 we voted to enshrine the rights of children into the Constitution, but what good is that if we are leaving some of the most vulnerable children exposed to horrific abuse?  Clearly, we need strong inter-agency co-operation to ensure the rights of the child are upheld.  We discovered yesterday that inter-agency co-operation was not taking place.</p>  <p>  We are talking about a 24-hour service which we have in four counties in the entire country.  The rest of the country does not have an out-of-hours service.  The ISPCC has been discussing the issue and was bringing it to the attention of previous Governments for the past ten years.  It is absolutely shocking.  What is the Minister going to do to address the issue of having a 24-hour, out-of-hours social care service which social care workers have been looking for?  We need to know that the Minister has confidence in Tusla and that she and her Department will support its expansion.  I also want her to address the issue of recruitment.</p></speech>

Some of the examples given and cases highlighted indicated that children were on the floor with excrement on their clothes and in dirt.  Some violence may have been inflicted on children in public places.  The case that stood out the most for me was that of the child identified as Mark.  It is quite chilling to think he may still be in circumstances of abuse and neglect.  It was quite shocking.</p>  <p>  There are two issues that I believe need to be followed up.  The first was touched on by Deputy anne Rabbitte, namely, having a 24-hour resource.  This is a matter on which the Garda respondents touched.  They suggested the system was systematically inadequate and under-resourced and could not facilitate access to case files on particular children.   There should be a 24-hour resource.  Having a telephone line is simply not enough.  There should be a real, substantial resource.</p>  <p>  The shocking revelations indicate a broken, dysfunctional system.  We cannot just have periodic expressions of outrage and then move on.  We need concrete action to make sure this will not happen again.  Central to this is implementing the recommendations made, but we have to go beyond this.  The report was excellent, but it covered a very discrete area of child protection, specifically related to section 12 of the Child Care Act.  We have come across various issues in recent years in regard to Tusla.  Public confidence in the agency is quite low.  We are now compelled to consider the overall child protection picture.  We would benefit greatly from an audit of the child protection system of the kind carried out by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  The Government should appoint a leading independent expert to head up such an audit, a much broader audit, across the range of child protection structures in place in the State.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Dr. Shannon's report has given rise to serious and understandable concerns and welcome the opportunity to set out the actions being taken.  </p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power to remove a child urgently from a situation for his or her safety and welfare.  Tusla social workers have no powers to enter a home or remove a child from a dangerous situation in an emergency.</p>  <p>  The issues raised in Dr. Shannon's report can be summarised under the following headings: inter-agency co-operation and communication; the repeated application of section 12; section 12 and out-of-hours services; and the lack of suitable emergency accommodation, leading to young people being admitted to hospital or kept safe at Garda stations.</p>  <p>  On inter-agency co-operation and communication, Dr. Shannon's review examined PULSE data from 2008 to 2015, all cases where section 12 had been applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014 and a sample of cases where it had been applied in 2015.  Since this time, Tusla has been fully established and set up processes to enhance inter-agency working.  Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla confirm that there is excellent communication and co-operation at senior management level.  It is recognised that there is always a need to ensure this is realised at local level.  In order to address this, both organisations have recently developed a joint protocol on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 which I am assured will be signed off on by the two organisations very shortly.  The joint protocol covers the application of section 12 and the process to be adopted during office hours and out-of-office hours as emergencies arise, in addition to notifications to Tusla.</p>  <p>  A dedicated Tusla official will be co-located at the Garda national child protection unit in the coming days.  Divisional protective services units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a feature of these units.</p>  <p>  In addition to the high-level Garda and Tusla strategic liaison committee, Tusla has put in place dedicated intake teams that monitor and manage section 12 cases, including consideration of the repeated use of section 12.  It has set up a team to review the contextual and situational factors and their actions in the 91 cases cited in Dr. Shannon's report and to consider the common themes arising.  The actions in these specific cases and the overall concerns raised in the report will be examined by the Tusla team.  The team will also consider specific cases to clarify the number of and reasons for repeat applications of section 12.  The report will be completed by the end of June.</p><p> With regard to the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015.  A national service now exists which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where the removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated.  It facilitates emergency foster and residential care for children who are removed from their families under this provision.  As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and bank holidays to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the busiest areas of Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow.  In light of Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s report, I have asked Tusla to look at the current demand for a similar service in the rest of the country.  Tusla will report back to me when it has reviewed this.</p> <p> In line with best child care practice, the majority of emergency accommodation is provided with foster family carers.  This meets the needs of the majority of children admitted in an emergency situation.  There are some situations where family care is not suitable, including where the young person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or is exhibiting suicidal ideation and may require medical assessment or treatment in hospital.  I have been assured that social admission to hospital only takes place in exceptional cases and where such a placement is for the safety of the young person.  I will be meeting Dr. Shannon within the coming week to discuss further the matters raised in his audit.</p></speech>

She spoke about the national service that came into being in 2015.  I am not being flippant here, but there are more than four counties in Ireland.  We have to look at the whole of Ireland and at the 26 counties.  Where are we going to roll this out if it is already being called a national service at this moment in time?  I personally believe that it is falling far short.  We have to be looking throughout the whole of the country to know that we have a 24-hour service.  The period in which most of these calls are made is from 10 p.m. at night to 3 a.m. in the morning.  That is when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is most needed to be called into service.  Garda&iacute; do not have proper training as child protection workers or social care workers.  That is why we need to crank it up so that we do have social care workers working 24 hours a day.  We also need weekend cover.  That is what the ISPCC keeps saying.  We need weekend cover and cover after 5 p.m. as well.</p>  <p>  There needs to be a radical overhaul of the current system.  I completely concur with what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is after saying.  We should bring in Dr. Shannon to look at child protection in its entirety.  We should not just focus in on section 12 cases.  If we look back over the cases we have discussed in this House over the last number of weeks, we have talked about the Grace case and the Mary case.  Child protection needs to be looked at in its entirety.</p></speech>

Yes, there have been improvements in some counties in the out-of-hours social worker services and I recognise that there is a contact number for garda&iacute;, but, as I said, garda&iacute; have found it to be generally inadequate and under-resourced.  It is an important issue.  They have not been able to facilitate access to case files on particular children.  That is my understanding at least from the respondents' answers.  It hampers their ability to make informed decisions.</p>  <p>  The Minister read the prepared full response and did not have the opportunity to respond to the audit point.  I ask her to respond to that.  I believe it is important as it would assist us.  There are garda&iacute;, social workers, people in management in Tusla and people in the Department doing their best, but a full audit of child protection services throughout the State is needed, rather than dealing with this in a piecemeal basis.  I thank Deputy Rabbitte for her support on this call.  It would allow us to take a step back, view the system in its entirety and offer us a roadmap to delivering a high-quality child protection service for the twenty-first century in order to be able to live up to the commitments of the children's referendum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000033#GG00400"><p>I will first address the question of the sufficiency or adequacy of the out-of-hours services.  As I already indicated, the establishment of full social work service teams in those four areas is something new and enhanced since the audit was undertaken in 2015.  Why the four areas?  Because that is where most of the cases occur.  That enhancement also has to do with the establishment of Tusla and of seven regions for the purpose of having a social worker on call out of hours to engage directly with a child in particular circumstances.  I heard Deputy Rabbitte saying that perhaps that is not sufficient.  I know others are calling for it to be extended.  I have asked Tusla to review the adequacy of the wider availability of speaking directly to a social worker in the other places where the use of section 12 are not as frequent.  Tusla will give me an analysis and I will look at decisions on whether or not it is the most effective way to use resources throughout the country and have social work teams available everywhere for out-of-hours service when it may not be required from an efficiency perspective.  At the same time, we must ensure that our children are protected.  We are looking at it.  It is one of the issues, but there has been an enhancement of the service.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point, since 2015 there has been improved access to the child protection register for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was not the case before.  Garda&iacute; can get access to and take a look at a file to see what the risk of harm is for a particular child when they are making considerations with regard to section 12.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question about a full audit of the child protection system, as always, I am willing to consider recommendations or suggestions from the Deputy.  One of the first things I will ensure in the audit that we do have - involving the inter-agency group of a strategic liaison committee between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the HSE - is that we will take a look within a year's time at the recommendations, whether they have been implemented and whether they have been moved forward.  In addition, as the Deputy knows, there are a number of other reviews that are going on in the context of Tusla.  I need to look at those first before making a decision to call for a wider audit in order to see whether or not there would be overlap in that regard.  However, I will consider the Deputy's suggestions on that.</p></speech>

It serves three counties.  Fingal is the largest part of it, followed by Kildare as well as Lucan in south County Dublin.  It is a regional park for three counties.  People have become very concerned in recent times as to whether or not a major new road may be built through the park.  I have to say that one of my proudest achievements as a Minister in the 1990s, along with then Minister, Michael D. Higgins, was securing funding for the purchase of the lands at St. Catherine's Park in the Lucan Demesne from the farming family that had made it available for sale.  Importantly, it is also in the Liffey valley amenity area, which is a protected area of amenity that is absolutely vital to the enormous populations that live in Dublin 15, from Castleknock out to Mulhuddart and Clonsilla, in Lucan, Palmerstown and north Clondalkin, and in Leixlip and the surrounding areas in Kildare.</p>  <p>  Controversy arose recently when it was discovered that an indicative road line in the Fingal county plan showed a major new road cutting through the Liffey valley right on the Dublin-Kildare border.  The indicative line clearly shows that the road would basically slice straight through St. Catherine's Park, affecting the whole of the park, but - I have to be honest - particularly the Kildare side.  The reason I want to raise this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is that I am aware, as I am sure the Minister is in his own constituency, that people like road engineers and planners from time to time put down desire lines, indicative lines and such like on how we might have a major new road or road linkage in a particular spot but are oblivious to the concerns and interests of the local community.  In this case, the N3 and the N4 to the west of Dublin might be linked by a road through this indicative line that would basically avoid the M50.</p><p>The destruction of this wonderful regional park would be far too high a price to pay.  If it was to go through, given the topography of the area with the Liffey located down in a valley with the heights on the south and north sides, it would effectively require another much larger high-level bridge over the Liffey so it would be extraordinarily expensive.  </p> <p> The existing indicative route could not only destroy St. Catherine's Park, it would bring HGV traffic into the Ongar-Littlepace area in Dublin 15 to the particular detriment of estates with thousands of families, including estates like Beechfield, Blackwood and Littlepace.  The Minister could set aside the fears of residents by making a clear statement.  I want the Minister to ensure that notwithstanding various plans that may come from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Liffey valley amenity is preserved.  In respect of the capital plan, which is inadequately funded, as the Minister is aware, I had no idea that we could spend ransom sums of money on a huge new bridge over the Liffey at this point.  I would like to hear whether the Minister has been briefed on this and whether he is aware of it.  I know he is very positive about parks and green spaces as amenities, as am I.  I would like to get his assurances on this point.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000034#HH00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this subject.  On the surface, the destruction of amenities is something we must take very seriously.  I accept what the Deputy has said, particularly if a park is in danger of being destroyed or divided and if communities are being badly affected.  Have I been briefed on this?  Today was the first time I knew about this so I have not been briefed on it in any detail but I am aware of it.  The Deputy has put a strong case but she might be in the wrong place.</p>  <p>  I would like to clarify that link roads are generally regional or local roads and as the Deputy will be aware, the development and maintenance of such roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority concerned.  Nonetheless the possibility that the lives of people in St. Catherine's Park could be ruined must be taken very seriously if this is a real plan.  I know it is only an indicative plan at the moment.  It is also a matter for the relevant local authority in its capacity as the planning authority for its area to consider and adopt a development plan.  My Department has no function with regard to such matters.</p>  <p>  Where road projects are adopted, works are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable.  Arising from the arrangements in place relating to local property tax receipts, the four Dublin councils became self-funding for regional and local roads under the main road grant categories from 2015.  These grant programmes cover general road maintenance and strengthening, safety improvement and bridge rehabilitation works.  Provision was made in the capital plan for the upgrade of roads in the vicinity of Grange Castle Business Park and the Department as providing grant assistance for that strategic scheme.  This is, however, the only strategic road project in the Dublin area being grant assisted at present.</p>  <p>  The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, 2016-35 sets out principles for future road development in the GDA.  The strategy refers to the future enhancement of orbital movement between the N3 and N4 by widening existing roads and the development of new road links.  As I have outlined above, however, implementation of any such measures is a matter for the local authorities concerned.  </p>  <p>  Even though it is entirely a matter for the local authorities, my division made inquires of Fingal County Council today and got some information that the proposed link between the N3 and N4 has been a specific objective of Fingal's county development plan since 2005.  The road proposal is shown on sheet 13 of the current Fingal development plan 2017-23.  A small portion of the road proposal is also indicated in table seven of the current development as road schemes N3 and N4 link Ongar to Barnhill.  This would allow for access to zoned residential lands to the south of Hansfield train station on lands known as Barnhill.  All road proposals in the county development plan are indicative.  The N3-N4 link road is an indicative line on the development plan and no detailed route alignment map with a selection of road between the N4 and the approved road alignment within the zoned lands at Barnhill is available for inspection on the Fingal website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-30a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017053000034#HH00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his reply and for taking an interest in this proposal.  This is a park of under 200 acres in an area with the most enormous population growth.  I invite the Minister to see it because the Liffey runs through it and there are plenty of opportunities for the Royal Canal and the Liffey to be linked via a pedestrian footbridge up at the Royal Canal and to expand a very significant walking, and possibly cycling, route for west Dublin and possibly continue it on the south side.  This could eventually link up with the cycle way that is being developed in Dublin Bay via a Liffey route.  We should exercise our imagination about the potential of this for people living in very heavily congested areas.  This is an enormous amenity that is widely used.  Admittedly, when I persuaded the then Government to acquire this land, a proposal supported by Michael D. Higgins, Bertie Ahern and John Bruton, it was with a view to providing an amenity for people.  I hear what the Minister is saying, namely, that his Department has no role in regional roads.  He referenced the Hansfield development.  Hansfield is a special development zone that has been zoned for over ten years which if completed, would provide for another 3,000 houses.  Those houses would be very popular with people and I am totally in favour of that.  However, the road entry that is required for that does not impact at all on Lucan Demesne or St. Catherine's Park.  It is quite a distance away.  It is the question of that route, which would be relatively small and which is needed to access the housing, not then being used as a trojan horse to create a linkage at that point and in St. Catherine's Park between the N3 and N4.  If the council is telling the Minister that it needs the Hansfield access route to be developed, I would say "Yes" in the context of housing but that has nothing to do with that then passing over the Liffey or potentially destroying St. Catherine's Park.  Although Fingal County Council has given the Minister information, what it has given him is not quite fair.  I can certainly given the Minister more details.  When he sees the detailed map, he will see what I mean.</p></speech>

A Part 8 procedure for local authority development has also provided for the design of a section of road to cross over the railway line south of this into zoned residential lands at Barnhill.  No work has been done on the construction of this section of road to date and no further design or route options further south have been commenced.</p></speech>
