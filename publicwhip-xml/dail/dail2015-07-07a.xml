I would also like a comment on some reports in the press about an internal competition for vacancies at senior ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a case taken against the Public Appointments Service.  Given the recent publication of the Central Statistics Office report and trends in that regard, will the Minister outline the projected Garda numbers for 2015, 2016 and 2017?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700004#B00500"><p>The personnel strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 May was 12,772.  The first intake since 2009, consisting of 100 recruits, entered training in Templemore on 15 September 2014.  As part of the 2015 budget, I announced a further intake of 200 recruits, and on 15 December, the first 100 of those started.  The remaining 100 entered the college in February this year.  The September intake attested as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 23 April and, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, have been allocated by the Garda Commissioner to stations around the country, where they can get supervision and take up front-line duties.  There will be further attestations in July and September, and I have received sanction for a further two intakes of 125 each.  The number of new recruits coming on board is 550 in the past year.  Taking account of crime trends and policing priorities, they will be assigned appropriately.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to say precisely what Garda strength will be at the end of 2015, or even more so in 2016 and 2017, as this will depend on the number of retirements.  They can vary quite significantly from one year to the next.  As I have said all along, the retirement rate will be very carefully monitored and will naturally influence the level of recruitment needed to maintain Garda strength.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about internal vacancies at different levels.  At senior management level there are very few vacancies, but as we move down levels there are some vacancies, and the Garda Commissioner has permission to recruit for them.  I understand these will be filled through promotion competitions that are currently being arranged.  I will circulate a document to the Deputy with the precise figures for vacancies at each level where there is an opportunity for promotion.  The Deputy asked two further questions and I will return to them.</p></speech>

The Minister has indicated that there are 550 recruits in or about to be in training, which is welcome.  Will the Minister indicate where we will go after those 550 have been trained?  She has rightly pointed out there are 12,772 garda&iacute;, but we must bear in mind that 1,498 garda&iacute; are today eligible for retirement.  I know and accept that not all of those will go in one fell swoop.  We can add to this the 500 garda&iacute; who are out sick, on average, any day of the week, while another 230 are on incentivised career break.  What is the Minister's projection for recruitment for the latter part of this year and into next year?</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned Garda stations.  Many of the smaller stations that were not closed are supposed to be open, but they really only operate for an hour per day.  Is the Minister aware of the case taken by a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na against the Public Appointments Service and the Attorney General, which I read about in the press?  It relates to the interview process for the position of deputy commissioner.</p></speech>

In discussions with Templemore and the Garda Commissioner, it is very clear that this is the maximum Templemore can take per year.  It has been higher in the past, but there have been issues about supervision when those recruits go out into the community and we want to do it to the highest professional standards, as does the Garda.  I have said I want to see continuous recruitment to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Commissioner will keep an eye to the operational challenges.</p>  <p>  One must also consider the kind of reform that is under way when talking about effective policing.  It is very clear that investment in ICT is essential and will impact on effective use of Garda resources.  Much of crime now, in the case of burglaries, for example, involves highly mobile gangs.  The investment we have just made in the right type of vehicle is an essential part of targeting crime.  It is not about sitting behind a desk, it is about being out there and being mobile.  I would like to deal with the question Deputy Collins asked, very briefly if I could, about the open competition-----</p></speech>

As regards the independent policing authority, I am awaiting a time to bring that legislation into the D&aacute;il.

Clearly, once the independent policing authority is up and running, it would have a responsibility regarding recruitment, but not at this point.</p></speech>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost to the event-holder is determined by the number of Garda personnel deployed.  The operational plan for a particular event is formulated by local Garda management.  The objective in charging for police services is to recover the cost of providing the service and all such charges are agreed with event-holders in advance.</p>  <p>  I am sure that the House will agree that it is incumbent on all public bodies to ensure that they are run efficiently and cost-effectively.  One of the means the Garda Commissioner has at her disposal to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to charge for such services.  I consider the Garda Commissioner and her management team to be best placed to determine the appropriate level of reimbursement to be sought in each case.</p>  <p>  As regards the level of recoupment sought, I am advised by the Garda authorities that they seek to recover all of the policing costs associated with commercial events organised with the objective of making a financial gain without a specific community or charitable benefit.  In respect of events held with the objective of providing a service to the community and-or making a financial gain with surplus proceeds going to the local community, a contribution towards the policing costs is requested.  Exceptions to these arrangements are made, however, in respect of events run solely for charity purposes or national events such as the main St. Patrick's Day parade and charges are not levied in these cases.</p>  <p>  It is right that the Garda can charge for these services, but I support the lower level of charge for the kind of events the Deputy is asking about, which benefit the community.</p><p>I have no plans to amend section 30.  It seems to me that the Garda is implementing it in a fair and structured way.</p></speech>

I am aware of a festival in Donegal which struggles to raise funds every year.  They got some funding from local government or arts bodies for their festival.  They were charged &euro;4,000 for policing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - &euro;3,000 up front and &euro;1,000 afterwards - which was more than the grant aid they had received from other government bodies.  The garda&iacute; in Donegal are very upset about this.  They feel it is bad enough that their resources in the county have been cut back, the numbers of garda&iacute; have come down and their relationship with local communities is struggling as a result, but then they have to go and charge the organisers &euro;4,000 for policing of a festival that is invested back into the local community.  That is merely one example and I could give the Minister many more.  I believe the Minister needs to amend the section 30 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The intent was to charge for big stadia, such as Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium, but local not-for-profit festivals should not be contributing.  The garda&iacute; themselves do not want it.  They are in an impossible situation.  I am asking the Minister to amend the legislation.</p></speech>

As I stated, they have charges for these major commercial public events.  Being commercial, clearly, these are for profit.</p>  <p>  On the question of community events, these will take Garda time and there is a considerable cost to many of them.  It is incumbent on the organisers to reduce in so far as possible the level of policing that is needed at any particular event - obviously, we have to ensure public safety - and the presence of garda&iacute; is nevertheless essential at some of these events.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn has written to me in this regard.  He has concerns about certain events.  I do not think it needs an amendment to the legislation, but perhaps more refined criteria on these charges could be developed that would better reflect the ability of those organisations to respond.  The Deputy might like to contribute to that policy development.</p></speech>

Sometimes, where there is clear legislation, the garda&iacute; are given a clear framework.  Garda&iacute;, particularly in rural areas, pride themselves on the relationship they have with local communities, and it has been strong down the years.</p>  <p>  I did not realise the issue arose with local organisations but since I raised it, many other organisations have come forward and stated that they have endured this over recent years and they are very unhappy about it.  In communities that have been struggling over recent years with the recession, both the garda&iacute; and these community organisations do not want it.  If truth be told, I do not think the Minister would want it either.  I ask the Minister to engage with her departmental colleagues and the Garda Commissioner to see whether it would be better to give clear direction in the legislation through a simple amendment.  That would give them a clear framework in which to engage.</p>  <p>  It would be a good gesture from the Garda for it to work in partnership at festival time.  These festivals involve large numbers of volunteers.  If one has all these volunteers and the Garda given a professional framework, that would be much better for everybody involved.  I ask the Minister to amend the legislation.</p></speech>

There will be further refinements to the policy in that regard.  If, at that point, there is still a concern, I will discuss the issue with the Garda Commissioner to see whether any change to the legislation is necessary.  I do not believe any change is necessary at present, but it does suggests there is a need for greater clarity in this area given that a new policy document is being prepared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will help resolve matters.</p>  <p>  As a general principle, a graduated charge is a good idea in terms of responsibilities on those committees organising local events.</p><p>Clearly, their income must be taken into account and the charge must be reasonable if the event is considered worthy of being held.  Let us await the policy document and take the matter from there.</p></speech>

Does the Government intend to take on board these recommendations and make those changes?</p></reply>

This is the first time that any Government has examined the direct provision system in 15 years.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and I set up the working group.  All agencies working in this area were represented on it.  It has made 173 recommendations.  The report is broad and offers a roadmap for change in direct provision.</p>  <p>  Like other European countries, Ireland is responding to the number of asylum seekers looking for protection.  People who present must be accommodated.  Some countries detain them while others provide hostels of various types and still others provide no accommodation at all.  Ireland has a system of direct provision, which has been assessed by the working group.</p>  <p>  Quite a number of recommendations can be implemented in the short term whereas others are medium-term or long-term recommendations.  Some recommendations relate to persons who have been in the system for five years or longer and increasing the direct provision allowance.  They are of a cross-cutting nature and require that I consult with Cabinet colleagues.  Many have significant resource implications and impact on other programmes, such as social housing.</p>  <p>  We must be cognisant of the changing environment in terms of asylum seekers.  There has been a major increase in numbers.  We have seen the situation in the Mediterranean.  The numbers entering Ireland are set to double this year from 1,500 asylum seekers to 3,000.  While that is starting at a lower base than we had previously, the Government must consider the matter in the round.  My intention is to revert to the Government as soon as possible, having consulted with colleagues.  We need a Cabinet discussion.  The recommendations are cross-departmental in that they have implications for social welfare, housing and education.  A number of my colleagues have commented on some of the recommendations and indicated a number of changes that they are prepared to make and on which they are working.</p>  <p>  An excessive length of time is the key problem.  No other Minister has dealt with it, but we have the heads of a Bill that will introduce a single procedure.  That is what will make the difference.</p></speech>

Does she agree that the current situation is inhumane and intolerable, as described accurately by the Minister of State?  I am sure that she has visited the centres where conditions are inhumane and intolerable.  People have no individuality or freedom over what they do in their lives and are dependent on their centres to provide food that may not be of sufficient nutritional quality.  It is an horrific way to live.  Almost 8,000 people are in this situation, of whom nearly 2,000 are children.  More than 3,000 people have been in this situation for longer than five years.</p>  <p>  The report's points include the uncertainty overshadowing people's lives, the lack of personal autonomy over the most basic aspects of their lives, the lack of privacy, the challenges of sharing space with strangers, the boredom and isolation and an inability to support themselves.  After five years of living in this way, people's talents and skills, of which they have many, inevitably dim.  They feel that they have been oppressed.  Does the Minister agree that everyone should be gone after five years and that there should be an increase, which is still minimal as recommended, in the amount of money that they receive?</p></speech>

I accept that the accommodation varies in Ireland too.  There are issues for children and families in relation to accommodation.  The biggest problem is the length of time that children and families are spending in the system.  That was the point my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, was making about the conditions.  We are seeking to solve this problem by introducing new legislation to provide for a single procedure.  This will mean that people's cases will be dealt with within a period of between six months and a year.  The report says that when this more effective and efficient procedure has been introduced, other improvements can follow.  Of course this procedure will also mean that economic migrants who are here illegally - people who are not asylum seekers but are assessed under that process - will have to return where possible to their country of origin.  The EU stresses the issue of returns as well.</p></speech>

In parts of Europe, people are literally in prison camps.  We have something that approximates in some respects to open prison camps.  While our conditions are not as bad as those in some other parts of Europe, we should not compare ourselves to the very worst conditions in Europe.  Almost 8,000 people in this country are living in conditions that give them no control over the lives on a day-to-day basis.  They cannot buy things for their children.  They often cannot afford extracurricular activities for their children in school.  They cannot socialise, interact or be based in society.  The manner in which people are being treated is inhumane.  Does the Minister agree on a more fundamental level that we should not have a system that segregates people and takes them away from the rest of society?  I suggest that people should be allowed to work, to contribute to society, to pay tax and to live as normal human beings with proper decency and full human rights.</p></speech>

The children attend local primary and secondary schools, are entitled to medical services and are supported within the centres.  I have some concerns.  My primary concern and main effort right now is to make sure people are not in the system for lengthy periods.  As the report recognises, many of these difficulties come about because people are in the system for so long.  It can begin to feel very difficult for families in the system that have not had their cases heard.  It is clear that the uncertainty is extremely difficult for people who have been in the system for lengthy periods of time.  We have to deal with that.  There are approximately 4,500 people in the system.  At present, there is no accommodation for approximately 600 families that have been deemed to be asylum seekers.  Clearly, the Government's broader investment in social housing will be part of the answer to the situation we are currently facing.  I would say that this is a very big issue across Europe.  Sweden is currently taking 80,000 people a year.  Germany is taking 300,000 migrants.  There is a need for a much broader programme of action at EU level, along the lines of that outlined in the EU action programme on migration, to begin to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

Before I deal with the substance of his question, I would like to join him in expressing my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and many colleagues of the late Garda member, who have been so traumatised by this tragic death.  Like the Deputy, I think it is important that I should not exclude from the expression of sympathy the family and friends of the young woman who tragically lost her life in a road traffic incident on 1 January 2015.</p><p> As Members know, the Garda member in question had been the subject of an investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission into matters relating to Garda contact with a member of the public shortly before her death in the fatal road traffic incident.  As a result of concerns raised following the death of the Garda member and following consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which I am bound to do under the legislation, I decided to use the power available to me under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to initiate an inquiry by an independent judicial figure into the conduct of the GSOC investigation.</p> <p> I used section 109 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for the first time.  I wrote to the Chief Justice requesting her to invite a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court to conduct the inquiry.  The Chief Justice invited Mr. Justice Frank Clarke of the Supreme Court to conduct the inquiry and he has accepted the invitation.  I welcome that.  The inquiry will examine the conduct of designated officers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in respect of its investigation into the contact which members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had with a person on 1 January 2015 prior to her death in a tragic road traffic incident.  Section 109 allows the judge to conduct the inquiry in the manner he thinks proper and he has full judicial powers in doing so, including the power, if necessary, to enforce the attendance of witnesses or to compel the production of records.</p> <p> Obviously, I have had no involvement with that inquiry.  It is completely independent.  The Supreme Court Judge operates under the guidelines and will conduct the inquiry as he sees fit.  I am anxious to give him the time required to carry out the inquiry but, given the circumstances, I expect that the result of the inquiry should be available to me in the short to medium term.</p></speech>

It is appropriate following the call from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, for such an inquiry.</p>  <p>  A GSOC spokesman stated at the time that it often engaged in peer review, whereby it got sister organisations from outside the jurisdiction to peer review some of its case work.  Is that still happening in respect of this case and others?  If so, will the Minister outline how many peer reviews have happened and what was their outcome?</p>  <p>  Also, GSOC says that Sergeant Galvin was cleared as part of its investigation, yet the file had to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for the DPP to make the ultimate decision in that regard.  However, that was not communicated to Sergeant Galvin and the tragedy occurred.  Has the Minister asked GSOC, or has GSOC said, if any new protocols have been put in place to avoid something like this happening again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700009#G00300"><p>The Deputy's first question was about peer review.  Once this tragic death occurred and the case came under scrutiny, GSOC immediately initiated a peer review and had taken the first steps in that.  That was the right thing to do.  The peer review system regarding Garda complaints is well established, whereby somebody from outside GSOC staff and from another system is brought in to conduct an analysis.  That was an excellent first step in terms of GSOC's response to the situation.  I met with GSOC, as I am obliged to do under the legislation.  My decision at that point was that this was not enough and that section 109 should be used, so the peer review does not continue as a result.  Peer review has been used by GSOC at different times, but I do not have the number of times with me.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's second question was about protocols and referring cases.  GSOC has a practice of referring cases where a death has occurred to the DPP before it refers back to the people who have been under investigation.  Obviously there were particular circumstances in this case.</p><p>GSOC made that fact public as a result of the tragic circumstances.  That has been its approach, however, because while it may believe no further action is needed, it is still required to forward the case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for its view.</p></speech>

Should the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission not establish a protocol providing that, in cases in which it submits a file to the DPP making a recommendation that there is no case to answer, as occurred in the case of Sergeant Galvin, its decision will be immediately communicated to the person who was under investigation?  This would at least give the person comfort in the knowledge that the investigating body was satisfied with the outcome of the investigation.  At the same time, it is acknowledged that it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to make the formal decision on the case.</p>  <p>  Arising from the tragic case of Sergeant Galvin, has a three-way discussion taken place between the Minister, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na given the history of friction between GSOC and the Garda?  While the relationship between these bodies had been improving, this case will have set back recent progress.  In the interests of promoting confidence in the Garda and GSOC, the working relationship needs to be as good as possible. </p></speech>

Both sides have work to do regarding complaints, and they must work together.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question concerning the point at which persons under investigation should be informed of the outcome of the investigation, this is a complex issue.  As it arises in the case we are discussing, I would prefer to leave any further comment on the matter to the inquiry being conducted by the Supreme Court judge.  It may well be one of the issues addressed in the report of the inquiry, although I do not know one way or another whether that is the case.  As it is a possibility, I will await the findings of the report.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission clearly took a particular approach to this issue.  In cases involving a death, GSOC prefers to await the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions before giving the information to a person under investigation, given the possibility that the DPP will arrive at a different decision. </p></speech>

Ireland has never voiced opposition to search and rescue missions at European Union level, nor was I or any other Minister ever advised to do so.  Internal briefing pointed to one of the unintended consequences of such operations, namely, the risk of more smuggling activity in even more dangerous and unseaworthy vessels.  There was no question of Ireland or any Ministers being in any way at odds with our European colleagues on this matter.  There were concerns about how best to deal with people smuggling and traffickers and the risk of taking any action that would encourage the smugglers to abuse more vulnerable people and place them in unseaworthy vessels.  These concerns remain.  Some 200,000 people will be placed in such vessels this year and will land at various ports or be rescued at sea.</p><p>The European Union has six or seven naval ships in the Mediterranean, including the <i>LE Eithne</i>, which is carrying out search and rescue operations.  On one occasion, the <i>LE Eithne</i>rescued 650 migrants from dangerous boats, which can only travel for about 20 km once they have been put to sea.  Approximately 15% of the people rescued are women.</p><p>One of those rescued just a few weeks ago by the naval ship was a four week old baby.  These people are being exploited and, of course, the first thing we have to do is save them.<br/><br/>As Deputy Paul Murphy said, the number of deaths rose to record levels in April, but have since dropped off very significantly in May and June as a consequence of the enhanced search and rescue activity by EU member states.  We now have a bilateral arrangement with Italy which allows our naval vessel to go down into those waters.  We are not party to the Schengen Agreement and there was no legal competence to go down to the Mediterranean at EU level until the recent agreement was made.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/><i>LE Eithne </i>has already rescued more than 3,000 migrants.  The situation in the Mediterranean is a major priority at EU level.  The consensus both from the emergency joint meeting of EU Foreign and Interior Affairs Ministers in April, attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and myself, and the special European Council, attended by the Taoiseach a few days later was that the EU needed to take urgent action on a wide number of fronts.  The European Council conclusions from 23 April laid down clear guidelines on what actions were necessary.  These focused on strengthening Europe's presence at sea, fighting traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.<br/><br/>On 13 May 2015, the European Commission published the European agenda on migration, setting out a combination of immediate actions and longer term strategies.  This was followed by more specific measures on resettlement and relocation; an action plan against migrant smuggling and guidelines on implementing the eurodac regulation.  The two Commission proposals receiving most attention are those on the resettlement of 20,000 refugees and the relocation of 40,000 asylum seekers in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece to other member states, where their protection applications will be examined.  These measures, in particular the latter, were the main focus of discussion at the recent Justice and Home Affairs Council, which I attended on 15-16 June.  At that meeting, there were significant differences on the question of mandatory relocation quotas for member states and some also had difficulties with the share attributed to them.  The European Council returned to this theme in June, as agreed, and while the discussions were lengthy and difficult, they were also constructive.  The Council conclusions focus on three distinct pillars, relocation and resettlement, return and readmission, and co-operation with countries of origin and transit.  It includes an agreement to help 60,000 vulnerable people, through a mixture of resettlement and relocation.  Relocation will be exceptional and temporary and will be achieved on the basis of a voluntary distribution plan.  This plan will be agreed by consensus between member states by the end of July.<br/><br/>Ireland's position articulated most recently by the Taoiseach at the European Council and by me at the Justice and Home Affairs Council is one of support for solidarity which we were demonstrating in a number of ways.  Ireland responded almost immediately by agreeing to take 300 refugees for resettlement in addition to the 220 we were already committed to taking.  This puts us close to double the share we were being asked to take in the Commission proposal.  Clearly, our substantial humanitarian aid and the work of the <i>LE Eithne</i>are further demonstrations of our solidarity.  On the question of relocation, we have indicated that we are willing to give the issue careful consideration as an emergency once-off measure.  Ireland is not bound by the proposal in view of the protocol to the treaties on our position regarding the area of freedom, justice and security.  Ireland would have to opt-in to the measure and this would require Oireachtas approval before we could take part.  Realistically, given the timing and the need to see how the proposal evolves before making a decision, any exercise of Ireland's option in this respect would have to be made after the measure had been adopted at EU level.  Ireland is also one of many member states to emphasise the importance of addressing the root causes of migration in a holistic and comprehensive way.</p></speech>

It is a search and rescue operation as opposed to an emphasis on border control, which characterised Operation Triton.  Does the Minister therefore agree that the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum was likely responsible for the deaths of migrants attempting to enter the European Union?  The reported advice to the Minister that the migrant crisis had little direct impact on Ireland and no intervention was anticipated at the meeting is quite incredible.  Should the Irish Government not have intervened against the calls of others, including, reportedly, Britain, for the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum to say we should not have a fortress-Europe policy where this is treated as a defence issue, but should adopt instead a humanitarian approach to saving people's lives?  What position did Ireland take in the discussions that took place around the question of the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum?</p></speech>

Responding in the best possible way was on everyone's mind.  Clearly, there were humanitarian issues.  No one wants to see even one person lost at sea in these circumstances.  How does one deal effectively with people traffickers and smugglers who are ruthless and putting people into these boats?  There is a concern still shared by some member states that having a response in the area is sending the message to the smugglers to put more people into those boats.  Clearly, the European action programme on migration envisages more work with countries in Africa, more co-operation, more border controls, which is are very important, and a whole range of other actions that must be taken.  Obviously, the humanitarian response of saving lives is critical.  That is what is being done and Ireland is one of six countries which is involved in the search and rescue operation.</p></speech>

The smugglers are obviously dealers in death and should be condemned, but they are not the essential reason people are travelling.  People are travelling because they are in conditions of extreme poverty, are desperate and are trying to enter the European Union to have a better life.  I do not accept that search and rescue missions inadvertently assist criminal gangs and encourage less sea-worthy vessels.  People are going to travel to try to access Europe as long as their economies are destroyed and they are subject to wars, all of which the European Union more generally has a hand in.  Does the Minister have a comment on the fact that the position paper outlined that Ireland should press for longer-term solutions such as requiring neighbouring states to include in trade agreements with the EU conditions on stopping migration to the Union?  That is a repeat of the outsourcing of the militarisation of Europe's borders further beyond Europe as was done with Colonel Gadaffi whereby these people are paid money to keep migrants away.  Is that really the answer?  Should we not be trying to improve conditions in North Africa and the Middle East so that people do not feel the need to travel in such dangerous vessels?</p></speech>

Clearly, the breakdown of governance -  the conflict situations - are the root causes of the problem.  The Deputy is absolutely right that greater global work needs to be done to deal with those conflict situations and to ensure that there is governance in those countries in order that people are not as vulnerable as they clearly are at present.</p> <p> Ireland being outside the Schengen Agreement is in a different position.  However, I certainly have been very strong in saying that we want to respond in a humanitarian manner.  We immediately responded to the request for resettlement of Syrian and Eritrean refugees when we were asked to do so some months ago.  We are taking slightly above the numbers requested.  We have resettled approximately 2,000 people during the past ten years.  That has happened where people have been assessed as refugees.  We have also received a new request for the relocation of refugees which we now have to consider.</p></speech>

Has she an update on that and when will her Department make an official response to the new evidence that has been presented?</p></reply>

I met with the Stardust Victims and Relatives Committee last year and that meeting provided me with an opportunity to hear at first hand the ongoing concerns of the committee in regard to this tragic event.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that these events were the subject of a tribunal of inquiry which reported in 1982 and an independent legal examination which reported in 2009.  The report of the independent legal examination concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.   The then Government, as the Deputies present will be aware, accepted those findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing those conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families.</p>  <p>  Following my meeting with the committee and hearing the representatives' concerns, I appointed an official in my Department to liaise with the committee and who has engaged with representatives of the committee in the intervening period.</p>  <p>  A researcher associated with the committee, who is known to the Deputy, submitted material relating to these events to my Department and a meeting was held with the researcher and another person associated with the committee.  The material previously submitted and the matters raised at that meeting have continued to be examined in my Department.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that some of the matters the committee raised, which it raised with me previously, are subject to a Garda investigation, and that is ongoing and quite complex at present.  I am informed by  the Garda Commissioner that it is, as I have said, a complex investigation and I cannot do anything that might cut across that investigation, but there has been ongoing contact with my Department and a range of material has been submitted which has had further analysis.  I will be back in contact with the committee in regard to that analysis.</p></speech>

Can she give a commitment that it will be examined in a timely manner?  The Minister said she meet the victims' committee, which was very much appreciated, but that was more than a year ago.  I know there was an issue about evidence being presented and then being taken back but that evidence is now with her Department.  Can she make sure that the most qualified people examine that information and that a decision on it will be made in a timely manner?</p></speech>

We made every effort to have the evidence presented to us again so that we could examine it in good faith.  We did that and that has happened.  It is complex material.  It is partly composed of, and makes reference to, among other things, a report of the tribunal of inquiry, transcripts of evidence to the tribunal of inquiry and the report of the independent legal examination.</p><p>I assure the Deputy that we have been examining the material.  A specific official has been assigned to examine it.  A great deal of time and effort has been put into examining the material to try to analyse what is new.  Is there new material?  Is it different from the evidence presented previously?  It is complex.  If it was simple it would have been done before now, and I remind the Deputy that there have been two investigations already.  We will be in contact with the committee again shortly and will be responding to the material that has been given.  It is up to the committee then to come back to us.</p></speech>

Can she shed any light on the allegations made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Can she give an update to the House regarding that?

There is an individual officer assigned to it who has put a huge amount of time and effort into going through the material and responding to many telephone calls and contact from the committee.  That contact will be made, and we will revert to the members of the committee asking for comment on a variety of issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to the investigation, when I met the committee the members raised concerns with me which I do not want to put on the floor of the House now because they are the subject of the Garda investigation.  When they were told to me I did say to the committee members that they should report any details they had relating to that particular issue to the Garda.

There is a deep sense of injustice in regard to the inquiries and reviews that have taken place over the years.  My personal opinion, based on evidence I have seen, is that justice was not served.  If I am correct, that is appalling because this tragedy resulted in the biggest loss of life in the history of the State.  I appreciate that the Minister is facing a wide range of reviews and allegations across spectrums of Irish society, but this one is of huge importance not just to the families but to the Irish people.  I ask that whatever support the Minister's Department officials can give should be provided.  The families have limited resources but what they have put together with those limited resources is impressive, and they deserve a chance to revisit this entire issue.</p></speech>

To quote, "the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest."  That is what was said in 2009.  However, notwithstanding that, I have met with the committee.  I have got the new material.  I want to have the fullest possible information available to me before making any decision as to how the issue might be progressed.  I know the committee members are extremely anxious about this issue.  As the Deputy said, it was the greatest loss of life in tragic circumstances.  A draft preliminary examination of the material has now been completed.  I will be going back to the committee and asking for the members' response, and I will then examine what they have to say.  There are some other issues which they have brought to my attention as well.</p></speech>

This is reflected in the Policing Plan 2015.  Effective action has been taken in the past and in recent times against many of the criminal gangs operating in this country, not least by the development of the Criminal Assets Bureau but also good quality Garda investigations, as evidenced by the fact that there are people currently serving time in prison in respect of 24 of the 25 murders carried out in Limerick.  </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has various programmes and targeted activities in place to tackle organised crime.  These are designed to, as suggested by the Deputy, disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations.  This involves a great deal of international work as well.  Increasingly, criminals are operating across borders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with Interpol and Europol in this regard.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  We are seeing significant results in terms of arrests being made and people being brought before the courts, as well as drugs and firearms seizures.  Across the European Union, people are becoming increasingly concerned about the level of firearms smuggling taking place.  I am in contact with the Garda Commissioner in regard to all aspects of serious crime, including the threat posed by criminal gangs.  Criminal activity, in terms of the ever more sophisticated means being used by criminal gangs, is a challenge to every country.  It is important that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well resourced.  For this reason, we have invested in additional Garda vehicles and extra policing.</p></speech>

Are there any specific measures that might be employed to deter the enhancement of membership of criminal gangs, which young people find attractive?  What measures are most effective in meeting that particular challenge?  Is it education, further education or severe action against criminal gangs that is required?  What is most likely to be effective?</p></speech>

There have been many significant drugs seizures here and abroad, including the seizure off the south west coast of Ireland last September of cocaine which had a street value of &euro;358 million and the seizure off the Spanish coast of cocaine valued at &euro;210 million, which is a clear indication that the operations of these criminal gangs is being interrupted.</p>  <p>  With regard to discouraging young people from involvement in criminal activity, this is a priority area.  The Irish youth justice service and the Garda youth diversion projects nationwide do important work in this regard.  Additional funding has been made available this year from the Dormant Accounts Fund to enable expansion of the network of diversion programmes countrywide, thereby ensuring the availability of additional youth workers to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across communities in identifying young people at risk and ensuring they can be diverted from the life of crime, about which the Deputy has spoken.</p></speech>

It is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking simply to outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner.  Chief among these is that such gangs do not have quite the same permanency as proscribed organisations in terms of organisation and structure.  Such matters are kept under review but the most effective disincentive to this type of activity is effective policing, disruption of activities and seizure of goods.  The Criminal Assets Bureau, as I said, has had a huge impact over the years in targeting property.  That approach continues to be an effective way of dealing with criminal gangs.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, gangland crime has raised its ugly head once again in the city, with an attempted hit last week on a former gangland figure next to the sports campus at the University of Limerick.  There is huge concern among people there at the potential re-emergence of gangland violence following a period of relative calm in the wake of the incarceration of a large number of gangland figures.  The potential reputational damage to Limerick if this type of activity is allowed to happen again is hugely concerning for both tourism and business.  Will the Minister find time to come to Limerick to meet with garda&iacute; working on the front line, business people, those working in tourism and residents?

An investigation is under way into the situation to which the Deputy referred and a person has been arrested in connection with it.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further other than to encourage people who might have information to come forward.  It was through that combination of Garda work and community co-operation that those crimes were dealt with effectively in the past.

We have had 370 new Garda vehicles come on stream since the start of this year.  In addition, I recently secured sanction for a further &euro;700,000 for the purchase of new specialised response vehicles to support garda&iacute; in reacting to current and emerging crime threats, including those committed by highly mobile gangs.<b></b>There is a growing problem with mobile gangs moving from one location to another.  The best way to combat this is by ensuring garda&iacute; have the resources they need to facilitate a mobile capability in intercepting such crimes.</p><p>The Garda has had a very high success rate in apprehending burglaries and so on.  However, it has been brought to my attention that there is a need for stronger sanction in respect of such crimes.  To that end, I will be introducing stronger legislation dealing with bail for serial offenders.</p><p>Serious and serial offending has to be dealt with by imprisonment; that is the reality.  Consecutive rather than concurrent sentences can be imposed for such offences.  The allocation of the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an operational matter.  </p> <p> On resources for the Garda, one of the major gaps which has never been dealt with in this country is the question of appropriate ICT.  This Government has taken action and will respond to the Garda Inspectorate's report.  I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on appropriate levels of investment in ICT for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because there will be more effective rostering and operational decision making when the ICT to support effective policing is in place.</p></reply>

I also welcome the commitment of her and her predecessor on the investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of reopening Templemore, the new recruits - some 550 are now in training - and the investment in Garda cars.  </p>  <p>  In rural areas, the visibility of garda&iacute;, in terms of the presence of a Garda car or cars in a locality, is very important in terms of making people feel there is an effective police presence and that they are more secure in their homes, particularly elderly people.  There needs to be continuous investment in garda&iacute; and Garda vehicles and resources because it is very important for people's peace of mind, in particular those living in rural areas.</p>  <p>  I refer to the regular meetings the Minister might have with the Garda Commissioner or assistant commissioners.  Do they get down to the nitty gritty, such as Garda divisional levels, recruits, concerns that might be brought to her attention and areas that would benefit from more recruits or vehicles?</p></speech>

I understand the Deputy's point on rural communities.  The change in policing in terms of more focus on mobile units is in no way intended to detract from community policing, which is essential in urban and rural and garda&iacute; are committed to that.  Given the changing nature of criminal activity, the garda&iacute; have to be very agile in responding to the type of crime we are now seeing.  </p>  <p>  I have met many representatives from communities in rural areas in the past year and have been very impressed by what they are doing.  There is great community involvement in working with the Garda in the text alert system, which has been very effective in many rural communities.  I reassure the Deputy that there is as much a focus as ever on community policing in the rural context, but the way in which it has been done has changed.  As I said, garda&iacute; have been given the resources to respond in a more agile way to the crimes that have been committed by mobile gangs.</p></speech>

The criteria were wide and the timeframe turned out to be quite different from what I indicated at the beginning, given the scale of the cases that were referred and the mechanism I set up.  It is the first time a government has taken steps to examine a range of cases of concern to a variety of people, including Deputies.  It was an unprecedented exercise which had not been previously attempted.</p><p>It provides an independent, objective and consistent approach to dealing with these complaints.</p> <p> A total of 320 complaints were referred.  The Deputy knows the process of the independent review mechanism so I will not go over it again.  Counsel are totally independent of my Department and they determine the steps necessary to review each case.  They have the facility to request my Department to seek further information from the complainant or from other bodies which they believe may hold information relevant to their considerations.  Further information was provided by complainants in over 200 cases.  In recent months, a huge amount of material was continuously submitted by complainants which had then to be examined through the independent review mechanism.  Information was also requested through my Department at the request of the panel from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in approximately 80 cases.</p> <p> I have asked a judge to review the reports going out to individuals.  The judge has looked quite a number of cases at this point and, in many cases, the reports have been sent out.</p></speech>

Subsequent to the question being tabled some of the people who made complaints have begun to get replies and to say what they received is beyond their worst expectations is probably an understatement.  The letters I have seen from the panel represent a re-abuse of people badly let down by the system.  I am speaking about cases of unexplained deaths which family members believe to be murder, as in the case of James Goonan, where the reply of the panel to the family was that it was very sorry for the family's loss but that the family's problem seemed to be that the Garda did not investigate the murder properly.  The panel concluded that it would not ask the Garda to reinvestigate it, which would have been bad enough, but ask the Commissioner for a report.  That was the outcome of a year's deliberation in the case of an horrific death of an elderly gentleman.  A woman spoke to me this morning about sexual abuse allegations involving her two children which were not investigated.  The answer she received was that the case went to the DPP and that was it.  The whole point behind this was that people had problems with the investigative process, be it with the DPP or Garda, and to get an answer such as this exposes the entire system.</p></speech>

The 300 cases varied considerably.  Some were about property, some had been before the Supreme Court, some were historical cases from 20 years ago or more and some were more recent.  In every case the panel examined the material independently and objectively.  Approximately 80% of the cases have finished.  Some came in more recently so they are not finished.  Replies have started to be issued to the complainants.  An independent judge has examined the summary from the panel and has looked at the letters which have summarised the work of the panel.  There are many references to third parties so the entire material cannot be sent out.  The review panel put in place is objective and fair.</p>  <p>  I cannot go over the details of each case with the Deputy.  She may cite the details of individual cases but I am not in a position to go into the reasons and I owe it to the complainants to give them as much information as I can.  I cannot respond to particular cases highlighted by the Deputy.  An independent process was put in place which was fair and which independently reviewed all of the material, which has never been done before.  Recommendations in many of the cases will be made for further action of varying types.  Some cases will be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have new protocols.  In certain instances, GSOC will be asked to conduct an investigation where there was never an investigation before.  There is a variety of responses to individual cases.  I am not in a position to respond to the individual cases.  It would not be appropriate for me to do so.  I can describe the fair process put in place with an independent panel.</p></speech>

I would like her to re-examine the figures and statistics she gave.  It is precisely out of respect for the complainants that I raise these queries.  People such as the family of John Kelly are outside in the lashing of rain because their brother's death has never been explained.  We put out a call last time we had Question Time to ask many of the hundreds of people who submitted those complaints whether any of them had been asked for extra information or had any of them resubmitted extra information and been examined on it.  People came back and all said not in their case.  We are aware of many cases like the Tuohey family where evidence came to light and the panel patently refused to look at it.  I do not believe the process carried out any serious examination.  This side of the House raised concerns that it was an attempt to divert attention from the growing anger among some of the families for justice.  Of the replies we have seen so far, there has not been one, and the Minister did not answer how many of the cases have been concluded, because none of the conclusions we have seen, and we have begun to see many, would accept the viewpoint the Minister has put forward.</p></speech>

That is the fact of the matter.  I do not know with which complainants the Deputy is in touch.  I accept her bona fides but I am telling her more than 200 gave further information.  The process of the independent review is not a commission of investigation or an inquiry designed to make findings such as a commission would.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed.  I have given an indication of the type of further action recommended in some of the cases which have been seen.  The letters have begun to go out on the cases which are completed and this process has been overseen by an independent judge.</p></speech>

This was raised in the D&aacute;il last week by Deputy Mick Wallace, who raised serious concerns and made serious allegations.  We know BBC Northern Ireland has carried out an extensive investigation in a programme yet to be aired, but some of its people have already spoken about it.  Many statements have been publicly made by key stakeholders involved, and various leading politicians have denied any involvement whatsoever.  I am minded of the remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in April 2014.</p><p>He asked the agency to conduct a review with a view to accelerating the sale of its loan book and bundling properties together.  He stated: "I have asked [NAMA] if they have any suggestions on how we could work that and would it be possible to use it as a brake on the market."  By this, he was asking what would be the consequences at the end of 2015 of taking the residual NAMA book and doing what IBRC did to its residual book in selling it off in a six-month period.  One might now argue that one of the consequences was the kind of deal done with Project Eagle, where the entire Northern Ireland property portfolio of NAMA was put into one bundle and sold at a loss of around &euro;200 million to NAMA and a discount of approximately 72%.</p> <p> We now know that, essentially, &pound;7 million ended up in an Isle of Man bank account.  That is not contested.  We know the money was in an account controlled by a former managing partner of Belfast law firm Tughans, which acted indirectly for Cerberus, the US investment firm that bought the loan book.  We know Pimco, another large US firm, withdrew from a tender process for the same loan book, citing concerns about an unsolicited approach from a number of individuals.</p></speech>

NAMA has confirmed that Pimco's compliance staff discovered that its proposed fee arrangement with US law firm Brown Rudnick also included the payment of fees to Tughans and a former external member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee.  This is in the public domain and I am not naming any names.  Tughans has now stated that a former partner diverted the professional fees into an account without the knowledge of other partners.</p>  <p>  Suffice it to say that this is very serious and profound stuff that goes to the very heart of whether a proper deal was done on behalf of the taxpayer.  I acknowledge that we have had many different commissions of investigation established but, given the gravity of what has been alleged and what we already know publicly or NAMA has confirmed, a commission of investigation is urgently required to investigate this entire episode involving the sale of the Northern Ireland loan book to the company concerned.  Has the Government made a decision to set up such a commission of investigation?</p></speech>

First, it is important to say that NAMA has a very clear public mandate to deliver best value and in that role it is very actively overseen by the Oireachtas.  There is an embedded member of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office working with NAMA, it conducts regular audits and representatives come to the Committee of Public Accounts on a quarterly basis with information.  I understand NAMA representatives will be before the Committee of Public Accounts this Thursday, and there will be an opportunity for members of that important committee of the House to question those representatives on the way NAMA manages its affairs.</p>  <p>  The issues raised and which are a cause of public concern regarding the destination of a fee are an entirely different matter.  It is important to understand the way in which NAMA dealt with this.  When it heard there was interest in the loan book, NAMA insisted there would be a competitive process and one of the companies involved, as the Deputy knows, was Pimco.  It indicated that its compliance staff had uncovered a proposed fee arrangement and when this came to the attention of NAMA, it decided that if Pimco did not withdraw from the sale, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process.  On foot of that, Pimco withdrew from the sale.  NAMA also sought assurances, I understand, in respect of the successful bidder in this project that there was no such arrangement in place.  It received such assurances.</p>  <p>  NAMA has discharged its business in a very thorough way.  The issues raised by the Deputy in respect of the decisions made by the NAMA board on whether to sell loans individually or in a bundle are a legitimate matter for questioning at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The representative of the Comptroller and Auditor General would have been across that decision at all stages and would have been involved with the auditing of the decision as it was made.  This information on how the business was conducted is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General and it would be available to the Committee of Public Accounts.  NAMA's representatives will be before the committee on Thursday.</p></speech>

This is not about a routine appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not the subject of a routine audit.  The timeline is very important.  The fee arrangement mentioned by the Minister necessitated the withdrawal of Pimco was brought to the attention of NAMA by Pimco, by the way.  No auditor or anybody else discovered that.  Representatives of Pimco went to NAMA and indicated that its compliance personnel were very concerned about the unsolicited approaches, the nature of those approaches and the fee arrangements.  Within a month, NAMA sold the package to another major investment company, Cerberus, apparently with a similar fee arrangement process in place and with the diversion of up to &pound;7 million into an Isle of Man bank account.</p>  <p>  It is glaringly obvious that this demands a very serious, independent and objective inquiry, with compellability, into the specifics of this issue.  Very serious allegations have been made about what transpired and there are many unanswered questions.  This is entirely unsatisfactory.  This concerns the largest property sale ever on the island of Ireland, with 850 properties being bundled together and many intermediaries involved.  A person was allegedly operating in a discrete office within the Tughans building and people who served on the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA were involved with this issue.  That is very serious and I do not buy the line that NAMA just accepted assurances, with that being the end of the matter.  It is not the end of the matter.  Just as with previous occasions, the Government has been slow to come to the mark on issues like this.

That has been overseen and supervised by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General has somebody embedded in NAMA.  NAMA's board is appointed by the Oireachtas to get best value and to have this level of Oireachtas oversight.  We have a unique level of Oireachtas oversight with respect to this body and the opportunities are there for Members to raise issues at the Committee of Public Accounts, where they have the support of the Comptroller and Auditor General, an expert in forensic accounting advice who is the auditor to NAMA and who will have gone through these issues.  Thursday's meeting offers an opportunity to deal with the NAMA involvement.</p>  <p>  There are clearly other issues regarding fees paid on the other side of the trade and they are of public concern.  I understand the Northern Ireland Assembly is investigating those, as is the Law Society, with respect to the solicitor involved.  There are investigations of those matters under way.</p></speech>

This deals with billions of euro in public assets being sold to vulture capitalists behind closed doors and without any democratic oversight.  NAMA has been ordered by the Government to wind up faster than its 2020 remit, which also raises concerns about a fire sale of assets; we have raised that issue here many times.  Sinn F&eacute;in has little confidence that the Government is protecting the public interest.</p><p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was aware of concerns about the sale of NAMA's northern portfolio before it even happened because the matter was raised in the D&aacute;il by an Teachta Pearse Doherty.  Last week's allegations by an Teachta Mick Wallace suggest insider trading and political croneyism in that sale.  These loans had a value of &euro;4.5 billion, but NAMA allegedly sold them to the US vulture capital firm Cerberus for just &euro;1.3 billion.  Another US firm, Pimco, withdrew from the sales process in March last year after it brought to NAMA's attention an attempt by a former NAMA adviser, Frank Cushnahan, to solicit payments.  Did NAMA report this whole business to the Minister?  Did NAMA report to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the reasons for Pimco's withdrawal?  If it did not, is that not a question that needs to be answered?  If it did, just three weeks after the withdrawal of Pimco, how did the Cerberus deal proceed, considering the involvement of many of the same actors?  Will the Minister accept that this latest scandal demands the establishment of a commission of investigation into the management and operation of NAMA?</p></speech>

It was not told how to conduct its sales or whether they should be done individually or bundled: it was told to secure best value.  It was also to be overseen by the Oireachtas, via the Comptroller and Auditor General and through the PAC.  A system was put in place to give it the necessary discretion to act in the interest of the taxpayer, to maximise value, but at the same time the Oireachtas had this oversight mechanism.  It has pursued that faithfully and has reported faithfully in respect of this.</p>  <p>  On the issue of whether a sale of a loan realises the book value, as the Deputy knows - if he does not know he can consult the records of the House - often these banks had only a tiny proportion of the real value that was loaned in their books.  That was the nature of the crash we experienced.  There is no question that one can expect NAMA to realise the full book value of loans that were transferred to NAMA at a substantial haircut.  I do not know what the haircut on individual loans was, nor is that a matter of public knowledge, but it is clear that they did not have anywhere near the book value.  NAMA has dealt with this in the way I outlined by open tender.  It was a competitive tender.  It was overseen by the Comptroller and Auditor General's representative, it was subject to audit in the normal way and it was subject to a report back to the PAC.</p>  <p>  The issue of the involvement on the other side of the trade of possible fee structures was brought to the attention of NAMA's board.  It acted properly to disallow the company that was bidding in such a way.  It informed the Minister of its decision, as it should have, and it then proceeded, when the successful tender came through, to seek assurances that no such fee was being paid and it received those assurances from the successful bidder.  NAMA has behaved properly in the way it has conducted its business and the record of the way it handled this speaks for itself.</p></speech>

One of the conditions of the sale process of the northern portfolio, following the withdrawal of Pimco, was that no former director should receive payment as a result of NAMA transactions.  However, we know the law firm involved in the Cerberus deal had &euro;7 million lodged in an offshore account.  That is an awful lot of public money.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, says he does not accept that there should be a commission of investigation into this.  The Minister for Finance has been silent on these matters.  I have asked him and I have written to him to make a statement and he has said nothing.  I have seen time after time since I have come here that this Government messes about, prevaricates, puts things on the long finger, kicks them up the road and does not move smartly and sharply.  Why would it not establish a commission of investigation?  Why would it not let the issue be dealt with by those who have the authority, the ability, the resources and the capacity to deal with them?</p>  <p>  My other point is that the Government is proposing to parcel up all of NAMA's remaining portfolios, to be disposed of in one sale.  I understand that Cerberus is a leading bidder in that.  In the same week this scandal emerged, the Government introduced legislation to cut payments to lone parents.  It brought in legislation to pickpocket citizens' income to pay its water charges and it increased the six figure pensions of former taoisigh and Ministers.  Surely that type of zeal in dealing with ordinary people needs to be matched with a commitment to dealing with issues of corruption and graft that are causing so much anger.  I ask him again to reflect on his answer and to establish a commission of investigation into the management and the operation of NAMA.</p></speech>

Already, the pre-budget submissions are coming in and no doubt the Government will want to show the growth, improvement and recovery, as it did with the spring economic statement.  Just looking at two statistics from the spring economic statement, the general Government debt is down to 105% of GDP and it is expected to go down by another percentage, and GDP growth last year in Ireland was the highest in Europe.  What do those statistics mean in real terms to Irish people?  What is being presented statistically as improvement, indicating the healthy state of the economy, is actually masking the reality in Ireland.  The fine rhetoric and the statistics would give the impression that we are a template of how to turn a financial crisis around.  No doubt it has been turned around for some people, but those statistics are masking the suffering of Irish people.  I am talking about those on low incomes, lone parents and people with disabilities.  I am talking about a community sector working on a shoestring budget and yet providing valuable services in child care, education and in addiction services.</p><p>In terms of housing, 3,300 people in Dublin alone are in emergency accommodation and the Dublin City Council housing manager states it cannot cope such is the extent of the problem.  Looking at the disconnect, we have the growth and the health of the economy statistics and the reality.  How can the statistics mask the reality?  I suggest the answer lies in the way we measure poverty and that the current system is unbalanced.  One statistic from the current system is that 6.2% of people are in consistent poverty.  There are parts of Dublin Central and other parts of the country where the number in consistent poverty is double or treble that.  We need to look beyond mere economic indicators as the only indicators determining our prosperity and well-being.  For example, in the gross national happiness index, there are 33 indicators, including health, education, socio-cultural participation, community vitality and ecological diversity.  </p> <p> Does the Minister accept the need to look beyond a simplistic monetary measure as the sole indicator so that the Government will have real and comprehensive information about people's lives that would guide policy for the next budget?</p></speech>

There are now 105,000 more people at work since we started the Action Plan for Jobs.  That is 105,000 people's lives back on track.  It is also 105,000 people who are contributing on average &euro;20,000 per year into the Exchequer in terms of savings, which amounts to &euro;2 billion available to the Exchequer to deal with many pressing problems.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 2015 was written down for another year of cuts, had the troika forecast been accurate, but instead, because we have made progress on employment and other adjustments, we have been able to put money back this year.  We have put money back into special needs.  We have made provision in health and in many areas of pressing need.  We have increased the budgets for the homeless by 22%.  Certainly, it is not enough.  The economy is a work in progress.  I certainly will not rest still until we get back to full employment.  We can deliver that by 2018 but it means we have to continue to deliver policies that will allow that sort of growth.</p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is correct to say that we need to have broader measures of economic welfare than simply economic ones and that we need those wide indicators of sustainability, etc.  That is part of the way in which we need to develop impact indicators.  Many Departments are developing such impact indicators and, increasingly, they are working to indicators and publish them along with the Estimates so that people can see the impact of how the money is being spent on important measures of performance.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to have those broader measures but that cannot deviate from the fact that had we not got 105,000 people back to work, we would not have &euro;2 billion to put back to provide some relief for families for the impact of the past number of years.</p></speech>

However, there is a limitation in that regard.  In choosing a cut-off point, it is arbitrary and it does not take other factors into account - for example, how far below the poverty threshold people are and the length of time that people have been poor.  Therefore, we are not getting a comprehensive picture of the intensity, duration and persistence of poverty and there is a need for other measures that would provide a holistic approach to give a true picture of poverty.</p>  <p>  I referred to children living in consistent poverty and we know from the organisations working with them that there has been an increase.  That did not happen by accident but came about because of Government policy.  If poverty and inequality are to be really reduced and not only statistically, then the Government needs that comprehensive accurate information to guide policy and that is not coming from the current framework for measuring poverty.  As long as that continues, the disconnect will also continue between what the statistics say and the reality on the ground.</p></speech>

The measure that struck me most dramatically from my recent reading of the poverty report was the dramatic reduction of poverty for people who go back to work.  The risk of poverty is seven times higher if one is out of work than if one is in work.  The progress that the strategy has delivered, through Pathways to Work and Action Plan for Jobs, to get people back into employment has made an impact.  Some 141,000 people left the live register last year to enter employment and they saw their opportunities improve.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that these are all part-time jobs.  Some 91% of those additional 105,000 jobs are full-time.  Most of them are in strong well-paying sectors, such as ICT, manufacturing, construction and financial services.  They are right across the spectrum.  There are some in retail and in hospitality where pay levels would not be as high, but we are now in a position to establish a Low Pay Commission to look at the pay levels of those who are on low pay and to gradually, over time and based on evidence, increase those payments.  There is a dividend coming through as we get our economy back on track.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that we need a wider range of measures.  I know from colleagues that people are straining at the leash to be able to invest more in services but we can only that as we deliver the dividend that is coming from our successful economic approach.</p></speech>

My understanding is that this motion relates to removing Deputy McNamara from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>This is due to his voting against the Government on an issue.  Four years ago, the Government spoke about a democratic revolution, giving Parliament more independence and having more respect for it.  One would have assumed that, once Deputies were appointed to committees, and given their commitment and involvement therein, they would be allowed to continue making their contributions in the autumn of this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

It is regressive legislation that targets the low-paid and people on benefits.  Its guillotining raises a number of serious questions, particularly about good governance and whether democracy is functioning in terms of the Government's narrow remit to push its agenda with no consideration for other voices in the D&aacute;il.  Conversely, the Government claims that it cannot introduce legislation to stop additional top-ups to the pensions of former Ministers and Taoisigh.  The full resources of the Government are being used to guillotine the Second Stage debate of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill.  Will the Minister consider what the Government is doing?  The Bill was published only last month.  Its handling is contrary to all of the conventions of the D&aacute;il, as there are supposed to be two weeks between each Stage, yet this has not happened.  We object strongly to what is being undertaken.</p></speech>

A Government must govern.  If parties decide to try to block legislation, the Government must eventually make a decision.  The subject matter of the Bill came from the Law Reform Commission and there is broad support for ending the imprisonment of people for debts of this nature.  It is sensible legislation and should progress to Committee Stage, having had a good debate on Second Stage.  Committee Stage will be provided for.</p></speech>

Meanwhile, the crisis facing the health service continues.  In particular, overcrowding in emergency departments is at an all-time high since records began.  The number of people waiting on trolleys in St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin is up 332% on the June 2014 figure at 484.  In Waterford, the figure is up 178% on the June 2014 figure, a marked increase in the level of overcrowding.  The number at Beaumont Hospital is up 150% at 757.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, should know that well.  In Limerick, the figure is up 80%; in Galway, it is up 59%; in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, it is up 42%; and it is up 36% in Connolly Hospital.  The Minister talks about universal care now instead of a universal insurance system.</p>  <p>  Liam Doran, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, says that the level of deterioration, the resulting compromising of patient care and excessive workloads on working staff contained in these figures is truly shocking.  He says that what has been done to date has failed to address the problem, which continues to grow, and that it is the worst June in terms of overcrowding since the INMO began counting trolleys in 2004.</p>  <p>  I listened with great attention to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, last Saturday when he again spoke like a detached commentator, which has become synonymous with his term in office as Minister for Health.  The programme for Government outlines an extensive list of proposed legislation relating to the hospital system and particularly the application of universal health insurance to that system.  Is that legislation now shelved?  Are all the legislative commitments in the programme for Government relating to health shelved in light of the Minister's comments?  When will we see legislation on patient safety, particularly patients who are ending up on trolleys in such large numbers in the middle of summer?</p></speech>

Will the Government allocate time on Wednesday for a debate on the referendum in Greece?  It is one of the seismic events in the history of the European Union.  A very courageous stance was taken by Greek citizens.  The vote rejects austerity and is an endorsement of efforts to secure a debt write-down.  Given the consequences for the EU and particularly for citizens of this State, I ask the Government to allocate time to debate it.</p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is the Haddington Road agreement.  Will the Minister confirm that former Ministers and taoisigh are to get an increase in their pensions under this agreement as part of a side deal agreed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin?  Last week, the Fine Gael and Labour parties voted in favour of taking money out of the pockets of lone parents and today the D&aacute;il will debate the civil debt Bill, which allows money to be taken out of wages, welfare payments and pensions to pay for water charges and other utility bills.  Meanwhile, Dublin City Council is facing a shortfall of &euro;18.5 million for tackling the homelessness problem and will run out of money in October.  A total of 67 families were made homeless in Dublin in May and 65 were made homeless in June, while there are over 1,000 homeless children.  The House should consider this in the context of the new pension agreements for Ministers and former Ministers and taoisigh and the Minister's claim that he cannot prevent it.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister accept that significantly increasing pensions for politicians is entirely unacceptable?  Has any of this been equality proofed?  Will the Government take whatever steps are appropriate to reverse this situation?</p></speech>

We wait to hear what the Greek Government will put forward.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are clearly open to hearing proposals.  Ireland has a good record in the approach it took.  We managed to get debt relief through longer maturities and lower interest rates.  That saved the Irish taxpayer a large sum of money and gave us the space to have a growth strategy which has got 100,000 people back to work.  There is capacity to manage a deal, but a deal must be agreed with the partners.  There must be a strategy with which everybody agrees and I hope today offers an opportunity to make progress on that.</p>  <p>  On the second question, there was no side deal in respect of politicians.  The Deputy should look at the Government's track record.  On every occasion the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Government have made decisions to reduce payments to politicians, to reduce pensions and special payments and to give up severance payments that applied to politicians in the past.  The approach to this deal has been the same.</p></speech>

I am referring in the main to Gheel Autism Services in Dublin 3, but I have also heard of cuts to services at St. Michael's House, Baldoyle, and other disability services nationally.  I ask the Minister what exactly is going on.  Where is all the talk of equality and social inclusion while services are being ripped apart?  There may be no services for many of these physically and intellectually disabled young adults in September.  Imagine TCD or UCD students were treated in such a manner.  Imagine third level students were told in such a way that there would be no services for them in the autumn.  There would, rightly, be uproar.</p>  <p>  Today, we must focus on providing services at Gheel Autism Services in Fairview, Dublin 3.  We seem to be able to find the money for increases for politicians and for increases in the pensions of former Ministers.  In particular, I refer to a case that was notified to me by a parent.  She wrote to me with regard to her daughter who has just graduated from St. Paul's special school for children with autism in Beaumont and who was listed to commence an adult placement in September with Gheel Autism Services in Fairview.  A number of parents were called to a meeting with the director of Gheel Autism Services on Tuesday, 13 June.  They were informed that due to insufficient funding from the HSE, Gheel Autism Services would be unable to offer placements to their children in September.  He also said the board of Gheel Autism Services was not prepared to offer unsafe services to new clients.  It is an impossible situation for that parent to leave her daughter at home to regress after all the progress that has been made.  It is simply not an option.  I ask the Minister to listen to the parents.  There were 28 parents at the meeting to which I have referred and many of them are very upset and distressed.  Another parent approached me who was affected by cuts to services at St. Michael's House, Baldoyle.  That parent received notification of receiving a ten-day support service through July and August which is a total breach of an agreement that was made with parents.  Last year, the parent received support services for over three weeks in July and for the second half of August, which amounted to approximately 40 days in total.  That is a reduction of 66% in services.  As such, the Minister must listen to these families very carefully.</p>  <p>  The chief executive of Gheel Autism Services has responded to the HSE in relation to the insufficient funds allocated to meet needs and to ensure the service is in a financial position to provide quality, safe services for the sons and daughters of these families on a full-time basis.  The timeframe of 1 September is incredibly tight to guarantee the commencement of day services.  The service providers are saying they will endeavour to work towards this deadline but there are a number of confounding factors which must be considered.  There is a further problem in that the rental market in Dublin is highly competitive currently.  I urge the Minister to listen to these parents of young adults with intellectual and physical disabilities who deserve the services as a right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700026#Y00100"><p>I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for raising this issue.  I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is abroad on Government business.</p><p>The Health Service Executive allocates funding to Gheel Autism Services under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 on foot of a service agreement, which is reviewed on an annual basis.  In 2014, the agency received funding of &euro;6 million from the HSE for a range of services, including day, residential, respite and outreach services for adults with autism.</p><p>I understand that the funding issue raised by the Deputy has been highlighted by the need to provide new placements for young people with disabilities leaving school this year.  In that context, full-year funding of &euro;12 million was announced in the HSE's national service plan 2015 to meet the cost of providing new placements for school leavers and those graduating from rehabilitative training programmes this year. Some &euro;6 million of this funding is available in 2015 and is being allocated to community health care organisation areas to meet identified needs in line with the HSE's policy on day services for adults with a disability, as outlined in the New Directions<i></i>report.  An additional &euro;1.5 million has since been added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs to meet the needs of this cohort of young people.</p><p>The HSE is working closely with Gheel Autism Services and has assured me that it has recently been informed that it is being allocated &euro;708,000 to provide placements for 24 young people from 1 September.  I understand that Gheel has indicated to the HSE that it does not believe that this funding is sufficient to cover the cost of leasing suitable premises for five hubs needed to accommodate these 24 young people.</p><p>The HSE is very aware of the challenges faced by some service providers who may not have the physical capacity within their existing services to accommodate the new intake of school leavers in 2015 but are actively seeking appropriate accommodation to enable a service to commence this year.  The HSE has been engaging locally and nationally with these providers, including Gheel, and will continue to work with them to resolve these issues.  </p><p>In this context, a further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding is being allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.  The HSE has invited applications from all service providers, including Gheel, who wish to avail of this funding and its decision on capital allocations will be notified to providers in a matter of days.</p><p>The HSE recognises the valuable contribution Gheel Autism Services provides to people with autism, their families and carers.  I am assured that the HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers, including Gheel, to ensure that the resources available for specialist disability services, including services for school leavers, are used in the most effective manner possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700026#Y00200"><p>I accept the fact that the Minister stated in his reply: "I understand that Gheel has indicated to the HSE ... [that the funding is insufficient] to cover the cost of leasing suitable premises for five hubs needed to accommodate these 24 young people."  He has accepted that they have a major problem.  Does he accept that the HSE has offered funding at a level that is at least 50% lower than what was assessed on a needs basis by the Gheel service providers?  Is he aware that Gheel carried out an in-depth study on the needs of each new service user and its own funding requirements in order to meet its capacity deficits to cater for the growth in autism referrals?  This seems to have been ignored by the HSE.  It is a simple mathematics exercise to correct the provision of a service.</p>  <p>  The HSE issued the New Directions policy in 2012, setting out what is the appropriate model of care for those with special needs and a separate policy document setting out the required provision for people with autism but it has left funding woefully short in contradiction of these new policy commitments.  This is the first year in which adequate funding is not being provided.  I cannot accept an inferior service to that of previous years for other school leavers.  This means that school leavers, in particular, in previous years had the provision of a full service.  It is the service provided to the children specifically that is being threatened.  That is blatant discrimination. </p>  <p>  The HSE has known about the number of school leavers in 2015 for many years, via primary school returns and the national intellectual disability database, and it has not done any planning to cater for the increase in the number despite recent policy documents stating otherwise.  I would make the point again that if these were third level students in Trinity or UCD they would have an automatic access to such a service in the autumn, but this is not happening for young people with intellectual disability and that is blatant discrimination.</p></speech>

As I outlined, an additional  &euro;12 million has been provided for a full year in the national service plan, &euro;1.5 million has been added to that and &euro;6 million is available 2015, which is being allocated to the community health care organisation areas.  Rather than cuts, additional money is being made available.</p>  <p>  In this particular case, &euro;708,000 is being made available to provide new placements for 24 young people from 1 September.  On a rough calculation, that is nearly 30,000 per client for four months, therefore, &euro;30,000 is being provided for a four-month placement.  It may well be the case that the organisation concerned believes that is insufficient and it may well be correct or it may not be correct.  However, what needs to happen is an engagement involving the HSE managers on the ground who know that service well and know similar services well and who can work out whether it is practicable for that organisation to deliver that service for the amount of money that has been allocated, which is substantial.</p></speech>

This company had a dedicated workforce who worked hard over the years at this facility and this closure has come as a shock to them.  It is a big blow also to the town of Clonmel and the surrounding area.  This closure is a concern because it is part of a pattern of job losses in Tipperary over the last period, including the significant reduction in jobs at the Cantrell &amp;amp; Cochrane, C&amp;C, site, the Bulmers plant, which is also the site of the location of the Grant's facility.  There has been significant job losses there, an undermining of terms and conditions of employment and the transfer of production from the site.  There has also been job losses - some 12 jobs - at Gleeson's in Borrisoleigh, another C&amp;C facility, and 20 job losses nationally in administration and sales in C&amp;C.  There was a significant loss of 200 jobs at Intellicom in Clonmel in the recent past and also the closure of the Fairgreen supermarket in Carrick-on-Suir.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, Oireachtas Members from south Tipperary met the company, Grant's, and a number of disturbing elements arose, particularly the fact that the company had not made contact with the Minister's Department or with any jobs agencies either locally or nationally.  Also, the jobs agencies under the Minister's Department have given the company grants to build a distillery in Tullamore.  In other words, the Government has subsidised the transfer of jobs from Clonmel to Tullamore and, worse still, the Minister's Department took no steps to ensure the continuation of production of Tullamore Dew or an alternative product at the Clonmel facility.  What steps will the Minister take now to ensure that this closure is averted and that those jobs are saved?</p></speech>

Some 6,452 people are unemployed in south Tipperary and 7,995 people are unemployed in north Tipperary.  The blow of the loss of these jobs to Clonmel is huge.  I compliment the employees in Grant's, wish them well and also sympathise with them.  Grant's has moved from Clonmel.  Action is needed now to work on developing opportunities in other areas.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister, who is sitting beside his Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to stop the nonsense of his Cabinet colleague who, as we find today, is going around the globe, out in the United Nations.  He is like an apostle.  He might even go to Rome altogether and announce in the Vatican that he has found employment for Cashel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is working with all of us to try to fill the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson factory in Cashel.  We do not need Allah coming along and telling us that he has it filled and wheeling out a former ambassador to back up his claim.  This is ridiculous.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to reign in this desperate Minister.  That is what he is because, as I said last week, he would turn up for the opening of a can of Coke.  He is insisting on boards of management opening schools.  He is ringing the schools and giving them misinformation.</p><p>His colleagues should rein him in and tell him to cop on to himself.  This is a serious business we are in, and he should not be making high profile statements.</p></speech>

Last February, the IDA and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, announced that this plant had been purchased.  Today, we had an announcement on Tipp FM by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, that it had been purchased and that it would reopen under new ownership with the provision of jobs.  All of us in Tipperary have been making representations to the IDA about this plant and we were encouraged by the response we got from the IDA, but I would like the Minister to clarify whether the negotiations are ongoing or whether they have been completed.  How many jobs does he expect will prevail in the former Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson plant in Cashel?</p></speech>

I am very conscious that the announcement of a possible transfer of the operation in Clonmel by the company creates problems for the workers there, and my first thoughts are with those workers and their families, as well as the members of the local community, who have received this very difficult news.</p>  <p>  I understand the company concerned was started in 1886 in Scotland and is still family owned.  The company is the third largest producer of Scotch whisky.  The company made a strategic decision to broaden its spirits portfolio beyond Scotch and, in 2010, bought the Clonmel based spirits business of C&amp;C.  This comprised the brands of Tullamore Dew, Carolan's Irish Cream liquor and Irish Mist.  It subsequently sold the last two to Campari.  This gave the company the Tullamore Dew brand and production, and it is enabled by long-term agreements with other whiskey suppliers.  This was always going to be a temporary arrangement as, long-term, the company would not rely on direct competitors for whiskey.  The company continued to bottle Tullamore Dew on the C&amp;C site in Clonmel.  In addition, a co-packing arrangement was included on the Clonmel site bottling Carolan's Irish Cream liquor and Irish Mist liquor.</p>  <p>  The company subsequently decided to set up its own distillery.  The first phase, completed in late 2014, is for a malt and unmalted distillery at a total investment of &euro;35 million.  I am aware that the second phase to build a grain distillery is currently under way.  I understand that the activities concerning Tullamore Dew, which historically have been located in Clonmel, will now be transferred to Tullamore and integrated into the new distillery facility.</p>  <p>  The co-packing arrangement was reviewed in September 2014 and the company lost the contract.  The notice to terminate will take effect from September 2015.  There are 50 jobs concerned and redeployment to Tullamore, as well as the timing of the relocation of businesses, is now subject to discussions with employees.  On completion of the distillery and supporting service in Tullamore, it is estimated that the employment will grow on that site from a base of 66 in 2014 to 107 by 2019.</p>  <p>  I should point out that the company reiterates that it has consistently communicated with its employees about the long-term future of the business.  </p>  <p>  In regard to any possible job losses, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation which offers extensive protections to employees.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is mandated to ensure compliance with employment rights and it will be available to assist workers.  The Workplace Relations Commission can be contacted as well in terms of assistance and any workers who need support will have access to the State agencies concerned.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that on the wider front employment in the county and the region has been very much to the fore.  As they know, I decided earlier this year that we would develop regional action plans in all of our eight regions.  I will be working on an action plan, both for the mid-west and the south east, as a part of that.  We have put significant resources into that, and we are working with all stakeholders on the ground - chambers of commerce, agencies and education bodies - to ensure we get the very best ideas.  The Deputies will be aware that competitive calls have been made, and the local enterprise office is an area from which competitive calls can be made.</p>  <p>  In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Lowry, I am aware of reports in the media that the former J&amp;J factory in Clonmel has been sold to a United States pharmaceutical company.  As the Deputy knows, this was not an IDA site.  It was owned by J&amp;J, and there have been a series of deals.  IDA has been actively involved with all of the owners seeking to ensure that the best outcome would be secured for the prospect of bringing jobs to the site after the J&amp;J closure.  That continues to be the case.  The IDA will work with the new owners but for reasons of commercial confidentiality, I am not at liberty to give any details of discussions that may be going on with the new owners.  This is a very competitive business.  No deal is ever done until it is finalised, and the IDA will work with the new owner to try to secure a good outcome for the area.</p></speech>

In the past three years, there was a net loss of 321 IDA jobs in the county.  All towns in Tipperary have been excluded from the building of advanced factories and offices by the IDA.  Tipperary is not getting its fair share of investment and job creation.</p>  <p>  The Minister's Department and the jobs agencies have been aware since 2012 that the Tullamore Dew facility at Clonmel was to cease operations.  Effectively, he subsidised the transfer of jobs to Tullamore by way of giving grants for the distillery.  In the current circumstances, will the Minister at least set up a jobs task force for the county to ensure that Tipperary gets its fair share of jobs investment into the future?</p></speech>

This is too serious a situation for elected representatives in Tipperary to be playing political football with it and travelling to Geneva, Hong Kong or wherever and making these announcements.  I am talking about the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  We need to respect the people who are unemployed.  We need to support the small businesses in Tipperary which are giving employment.  We have serious worries about C&amp;C in Clonmel and Gleesons.  We have issues and we should sit down, negotiate and support the families, the workers and self-employed people in Tipperary.  We are lucky to have the farming industry.  I hope something comes to Cashel but eaten bread is soon forgotten, and I will not believe anything until I see jobs in place there.  Whatever the Minister, Deputy Kelly, says is poppycock.</p></speech>

It is encouraging to see that, for the first time, Tipperary has seen employment growth across our agencies - IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprises offices - and 260 additional people are at work in Tipperary in 2014 as a result of their efforts.  That is a start, and we need to build on that.</p>  <p>  In terms of unemployment, it has come down by close to 3,000 in Tipperary.  That is in sharp contrast to the previous period when 11,000 extra people became unemployed.  We are making some progress.  The decline in unemployment is around 17% in the county but I am very keen that more progress would be made, and that is the reason we have established the regional enterprise strategy.  That gives the Deputies but also various stakeholders in the region an opportunity to become involved in developing proposals, and competitive calls are being made to assist people.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Healy, the provision of support for the development of a distillery is not about displacing work elsewhere.  This is a valuable asset that this country needs.  There is a strong resurgence of distilleries here.  For 100 years not a single distillery had been opened, and now there are close to 25 either in planning or being opened.  It is a significant opportunity to use native grown material to develop a strong branded product that is inherent to our country and, therefore, it is something worth promoting.  It is disappointing to see jobs lost in any situation but I assure the Deputy that the grants provided to support a distillery is not to displace people elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Lowry for his encouragement.  I assure him that my determination is to see a good outcome.</p><p>It was very disappointing when J&amp;amp;J pulled out of the business there.  It was quite unexpected, it being such a significant player here.  J&amp;amp;J is a tremendous investor in Ireland.  It has disposed of this plant but I am hopeful we will be able to work on this.</p></speech>

The title of the committee, namely, the Carlow boundary committee, gives the game away.</p>  <p>  I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to abandon this process now and not cause unnecessary divisions on a matter long since closed.  There is no need for this to be done.  I am strongly critical of the Minister opening up this debate and allowing for unnecessary divisions at local level between people who live close to the boundary between Laois and Carlow.  Laois and Carlow counties work excellently as good local neighbours.  Good local neighbours should not be encroaching on each other's areas.  There is no reason for this to be done.  </p>  <p>  I have previously instanced another example of this in my own constituency.  The River Barrow runs through Laois and Carlow and is the county boundary for much of the area, although not the entire area.  Further up, the River Barrow runs through the town of Portarlington, part of which is in County Laois and the other part of which is in County Offaly.  There is never a problem in dealing with Portarlington issues because both councils work excellently as good neighbours for the good of Portarlington.  The same approach should be taken in relation to the area known as Graiguecullen, which is part of County Laois but adjacent to Carlow town.  The two counties can work excellently as good neighbours, as they have always done.</p>  <p>  My question for the Minister is: who, or what, is behind this move to change the county boundary for no good reason?  We will do all in our power to stop this happening.  I do not want to hear about opportunities for people to make representations to the boundary committee as this process should not go ahead.  It should be closed down.  Nobody in County Laois has asked for this to be done.  We want to know why the Minister will not leave well enough alone.</p>  <p>  As I have already stated, the terms of reference mention the Carlow boundary committee.  They also state that if there are to be changes to the county boundaries the impact of this on the municipal district of Carlow must be taken into account.  However, there is no mention in the terms of reference of the impact of any proposed change to the county boundaries on the municipal district of County Laois.  If part of Laois is moved into County Carlow, this will impact on the Graigueullen-Portarlington municipal district in County Laois.  There is no mention in the terms of reference of the part of Laois that will be affected.  I will challenge the Minister in regard to biased terms of reference that are not objective in that they reference only changes to the municipal district in Carlow.  It is not possible to change the Portarlington-Graiguecullen municipal district boundary between Laois and Carlow without impacting on the Portarlington or Graiguecullen-Portarlington municipal district.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is well aware of what is involved in this regard given the moves to change the county boundary between Drogheda and Meath.  The same is happening in Waterford in terms of Waterford wanting to take over part of south Kilkenny.  Counties can work well enough together but why is the Minister setting neighbours against each other for no good reason?  I want to know who is behind this proposal?  For as long as I have been a Deputy, this has been a live issue.  It comes up every five years and eventually goes away.  I intend to get to the bottom of what group of officials resurrects this issue every five years after it has been put to bed.  This is not necessary.  Counties Carlow and Laois are good neighbours and they want to remain so.  Good neighbours should not be encroaching on each other's area.  The Minister should stop this process now.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Fleming for the opportunity to update the House on this matter.</p><p>As Members are aware, on 19 June last, my colleague, the Minster for the Environment, Community and Local Government, announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford.  In the case of Carlow, the committee has been asked to carry out a review of the boundary between County Carlow and County Laois and to make recommendations with respect to that boundary and any consequential recommendations to the area of the municipal district of Carlow that it considers to be necessary in the interests of effective and convenient local government.  </p><p>The main rationale for undertaking the review of boundaries in Carlow is that there is a significant overspill of population into County Laois, based on the population figures taken from the 2011 census.  The logic of a boundary alteration, if recommended, would be to bring the administrative jurisdictions into line with the current settlement and development position.  Bringing an entire town or city within a single local authority area eliminates anomalies and distortions of divided administration, service provision, regulatory and enforcement responsibility and electoral representation, including problems such as competitive policies and practices between authorities in relation to planning, rating and charges, which can impact negatively on town centres.  Differences in standards of service delivery can also be eliminated.  It is also usual to extend the boundary to include not only existing development but an additional area to allow for future expansion and to avoid further boundary-related anomalies in the foreseeable future.  Consolidation of administrative responsibility can also strengthen the economic performance of the town by eliminating the anomalies to which I have referred and ensuring that there is a single authority working on its behalf.</p><p>The committee has been established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991.  Full details of the terms of reference and membership are available on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government website.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is delighted that people of such strong calibre and experience of local government were willing to come forward on a <i>pro bono</i>basis and assist in settling administrative boundaries for this area. </p><p>I have noted the questions posed by the Deputy in relation to the terms of reference.  I wish to assure him that I will raise them directly with the Minister on his behalf.</p></speech>

First, this process will result in further anomalies as D&aacute;il boundaries in the area correspond with the current county boundaries.  Since what is proposed will not change the D&aacute;il boundaries, this will result in the creation of an anomaly whereby we will have different local authority boundaries for county purposes, in terms of local authority administration, relative to the D&aacute;il constituency boundaries, leading to the need for further changes into the future.  Second, in regard to the committee, I propose to inquire about its members and their respective interests, roles and knowledge of these areas and if they have ever offered a view on these issues in the past.</p>  <p>  In the reply prepared by the Department, the Minister of State referred to a significant overspill of population from Carlow into County Laois, which is very disturbing.  Is it being suggested that Carlow is so full there is nowhere for people to live there and as such they are spilling over into County Laois?  That is extraordinary.  The problem for Laois, in terms of Carlow, is that the town to the eastern side of Carlow is not being developed.  Carlow County Council likes to develop the western side of the town which happens to be in County Laois.  However, as I said earlier, we have worked jointly on ring-roads around the towns and are currently working jointly on sewerage schemes around the town.  We have also worked jointly on housing issues.  Two of Carlow County Council's social housing estates were built in County Laois rather than County Carlow.  When it boils down to it, those involved in this process will not know the geography.  </p>  <p>  As I said earlier, part of the River Barrow runs through County Carlow.  We will be demanding, if this process continues, that the county boundary be shoved back to the River Barrow, to where it was 100 years ago.  We have allowed it encroach a little but will not allow it to encroach any further.</p></speech>

The majority of the provisions of that Act commenced with effect from 1 June 2014, and that date marked the activation of a range of significant changes in the local government system.  Policy decisions to replace town authorities with a new model of municipal governance are at the core of the reform agenda.  The model is designed to strengthen local government within counties and address widely acknowledged and long-standing weaknesses and anomalies in the previous system, including the problem of administration that is divided between town and county authorities.</p> <p> Municipal districts and borough districts, where they arise, now cover the entire territory of counties.  As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will, over time, result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation, with improved accountability and responsiveness to local needs.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication in both administrative and electoral terms.</p> <p> The establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Carlow and Laois is a natural and complementary development building on these changes.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, will study the report of the committees carefully after they have concluded their work at the end of February next year.</p></speech>

I understand the decision to close the facility was made in March and conveyed to staff at that time, but only became public knowledge in recent weeks.  In recent days, local public representatives attended a meeting with the president of the college, Professor Philip Nolan, in an effort to persuade management to defer the closure until an alternative arrangement is found.</p>  <p>  There is a long-standing proposal to build a municipal swimming pool in the area, which is supported by all local government representatives and Oireachtas Members.  The view is that it would be advantageous to have a discussion on the subject as quickly as possible.  Earlier today, all local representatives received an e-mail from the college authorities indicating that it is not intended to defer the closure of the pool but that they are prepared to engage with the local authority to ascertain whether there might be a joint approach to providing a facility that could be used by the local community and the college.  That proposal must be taken up.  The local community has raised money for this purpose and the local authority has made preparations in that regard.</p>  <p>  I propose that the college authorities be called upon once more to defer their decision to close the pool and that negotiations be initiated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with the local authority and the local community to find a solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700029#BB00300"><p>There are only two municipal swimming pools in County Kildare, in Athy and Naas, serving a population of 210,000.  The north Kildare towns of Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock have a combined population of some 60,000 and have become dependent on the very old pool on the NUI Maynooth campus.  Some 800 children will be directly affected by the closure, having been told their classes will finish at the end of August.  The area has a very large young population.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Durkan indicated, the three local Deputies have met with the college president to discuss the two main issues that arise out of the decision to close the college pool.  The first issue is the need to put in place a municipal pool and the second is the short-term response that is required in terms of retaining the facility at the university.  The president told us the university has no obligation to provide a public pool, that responsibility being one for the Government and the local authority.  The primary purpose of the college, he noted, is one of education. The president indicated that the cost of the works required to restore the pool to the required condition, which include improvements to air-handling and the fabric of the pool, would be some &euro;350,000.  In the meantime, he said, the college is losing money on operational costs.</p>  <p>  The most important outcome of our meeting with the president, however, was his clear indication that the college does not want the risk of managing even an upgraded facility.  In other words, it is not seeking the money needed to upgrade the pool.  That is not the issue.  The best we can hope for is that the college authorities might postpone the decision to close it.  The e-mail to which Deputy Durkan referred, which was sent today, states that it is simply not possible for the college to reverse the decision to close the pool unless there is agreement on a joint development with Kildare County Council of a swimming pool that meets the needs of the university and the community, in which case the college authorities would be willing to examine any viable case to reopen the pool at Maynooth on an interim basis.</p>  <p>  This situation arose as a result of the closure of the swimming pool fund in 2000, with no prospect of its being reopened.  There is a real need for action in this regard in north Kildare.</p></speech>

I was disappointed to learn of the closure of the swimming pool on the campus of NUI Maynooth.  The Deputies will appreciate that this was a decision for the college authorities and not one in which I was involved.  It is always a disappointment to see facilities close and I have no doubt this particular decision will be regretted by swimmers in Maynooth and the surrounding areas.  Swimming provides a marvellous sporting opportunity for people of all ages and abilities.  Given that so much swimming in Ireland takes place in indoor pools, it is also generally a weather-independent activity, a key advantage given our climate.</p>  <p>  Under the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of the provision of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  Since 2000, 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the scheme, of which 49 have been completed and the remaining nine are at various stages of development.  The allocation of the maximum LASPP grant of &euro;3.8 million is subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</p>  <p>  There are many complex technical aspects involved in refurbishing or replacing a swimming pool.  The whole process, from feasibility study to going on site, can and usually does take a number of years.  That is before we even get to the construction of the facility; construction itself typically takes at least a further 18 months.  A great amount of technical work by the local authorities is involved.  Modern pools generally include attractive additional features such as saunas, steam rooms and toddler pools, thereby providing better long-term value for money and greater benefit to local communities.  Due to changed economic circumstances, although building projects can in some cases be sourced at better rates, local authorities' funds from development levies and so on have decreased considerably, which has made the financing of pool projects very difficult.</p>  <p>  No decision has been made on the timing of a new round of the LASPP.  The clear focus is on completing as many of the pools in the current round as possible.  However, as we bring that round to a close, it will become clear that some pools will not take up their funding, which may give scope for a limited reopening of the LASPP, albeit on a more modest scale and with a limited number of projects.  It would then be open to all local authorities to apply, including Kildare County Council.  Factors such as population, local demand and existing access to pools will be a critical factor in deciding on the allocation of funding to projects under a reopened LASPP.  That will not happen tomorrow or next week, but it is something of which I am very conscious.</p>  <p>  In 2011 and 2012, I allocated more than &euro;14 million under an energy upgrade and enhanced disabled access initiative, under which grants of up to a maximum of &euro;400,000 were allocated to pools.  This scheme was a great success and I have witnessed its positive effects at first hand.  In a time of high energy costs, these grants helped pools to reduce their operating costs and become more viable.  As we all know, operating a swimming pool is a very expensive activity.  Given the great success of that scheme, I launched another round recently and the applications received are currently being assessed.  Such schemes are a clear recognition of the expense involved in running a swimming pool and the importance of ensuring those facilities remain open to provide a healthy activity for people of all ages and abilities.</p>  <p>  I am naturally disappointed to see the pool in Maynooth close, as I am when any such facility closes.  As I said, I am aware of the demand for a new swimming pool in north Kildare.  The area will be a prime candidate for a new pool when I have the opportunity and funding to open a new, limited round of the LASPP.</p></speech>

I ask him to consider, in the limited time available in this session, meeting the local authorities, Members and college authorities with a view to identifying the best possible options for the local community and the best possible value for money in the provision of facilities in the future, without tying anybody into a particular situation and recognising that the college authorities have a different source of revenue from the local community.  Would it be possible to arrange that in the short time available?  If so, Members and the college authorities would be anxious to be involved.</p>  <p>  I would strongly support the concept of a local or municipal pool if that were a possibility.  I would also like to examine any possibility of deferring the closure, which would be a serious blow to the swimming clubs and members of the local community that have traditionally used the pool.</p></speech>

No other county in the country has a population of more than 200,000 without a city in the middle.  As the population grows, it is supposed to be provided with services.  It may be a great idea to provide energy upgrades to other pools around the country, but that does not cut the mustard for the children who do not have swimming classes in their area.  Once this goes, nothing else will be available.  There is not even the hope of a pool.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this issue for the past four years.  I accept that in the early years of the Government it was not possible to provide the money, but it is outrageous that some local authorities are sitting on an allocation that they are not in a position to use while other parts of the country are in need.  Money could be diverted to deliver facilities in a more timely manner.  This is a complete failure to provide for a need, and I do not hear a whole lot in what the Minister of State said that gives me a great deal of comfort.  Nothing that will happen before the end of the Government's term gives us any hope of another pool.</p></speech>

Let us be honest.  In 2000 there was a scheme whereby 58 pools were selected, but there was no deadline for the closure of the scheme.  My hands are tied.  I have been conscious of the requests for swimming pools in certain areas with high populations.  I met the County and City Managers' Association, which has no love of swimming pools because they are too costly for local authorities.  It asked me to introduce a scheme and I provided &euro;14 million to assist with energy costs for existing pools.  A number of local authority pools throughout the country were in serious difficulty and unable to keep their doors open.  Without the scheme there were would more closures.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the pool in Maynooth is private.  Deputy Durkan asked me to meet local representatives and I will do so, but I will not meet those involved with private pools.  I have been under pressure from Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues and others over the past number of months and I am trying to open a limited scheme.  I do not want members in every local authority asking for a scheme when local authorities have no will or funding for such a scheme.  </p>  <p>  Two or three areas in the country are in need of pools and I am considering how we can introduce a scheme.  Pools will be provided in areas where demand exists and feasibility studies will be done to ensure they will be profitable.  There is no point in setting up pools that will be in difficulty six months after they have opened.  The Deputies have a point and I am examining the issue.  I gave a commitment and asked my officials some months ago to develop a scheme whereby we can deal with two or three areas in the country and give them the opportunity to have a pool.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700030#CC00500"><p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann take note of the Statement of Estimates of moneys required in respect of ongoing expenditure for the period beginning on 1 January 2016 and ending on 31 December 2016, prepared and published by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in accordance with section 13 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, as amended by section 8 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2006 and section 9 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2009, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 2 July 2015.</blockquote>Under section 5 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts 2003-2013, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is funded on the basis of a three-year statutory cycle.  Its current funding allocation of &euro;324 million covers the period from 2013 to 2015.  New legislation will be introduced at the end of 2015 to provide the commission with its funding for the next three-year cycle, 2016 to 2018.  The commission is required under section 13 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts to prepare and publish an annual statement of Estimates.  The statement of Estimates before the D&aacute;il for noting today is in respect of the estimated expenditure covering the period beginning on 1 January 2016 and ending on 31 December 2016.  </p><p>It was normal in the past for this Estimates process to be undertaken in October of each year, but due to the fact that since 2013 the budget has been brought forward from December to October under the new European semester, it is now necessary for the commission to have the statement of Estimates noted by the D&aacute;il before the House goes into recess in July.  This is because, under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, the statement of Estimates of the commission must be furnished by the Secretary General to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform not later than 30 days before the presentation by the Minister to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Estimates of the receipts and expenditure of that year.  </p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Appointments to Certain Offices) Bill 2014, which is currently before the House, will allow for changes in this regard.  It will delete the 30-day provision to allow time for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service to submit Estimates much closer to the budget, having had the opportunity to finalise figures in the September-October period, which will enable it to have a much more accurate assessment of expenditure trends before it has to submit a scheme of expenditure to the House for noting.</p><p>The Estimate amount required by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for 2016 is &euro;130.99 million.  This is &euro;18.7 million, or 16.6%, higher than the 2015 Estimate.  The main reason for the 16% increase is the need to cover costs arising from the D&aacute;il and Seanad elections which must take place by early next year.  Election costs of &euro;14.3 million have been included in the Estimate.  When the election costs are removed, the underlying increase over the 2015 Estimate is &euro;4.3 million, or 4%.  This can be attributed to, among other things, an increase in the ICT project budget to account for a new parliamentary questions system, with which Deputies will be familiar, a new website, and new technologies in the Chamber, as well as an increased allocation for legal services and increased security measures.  I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>

Most businesses look at next year's budget at this time of the year and they do not leave it to the back end of the year.  When I saw this Estimate coming through in advance of year end and next year I thought if only the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments could follow the example given by the Houses of the Oireachtas in coming forward with an early estimate of expenditure for the coming year it would be very good.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise several particular issues.  It will be popular to slag off politicians today, as people think there are votes to be got by running down the national Parliament.  I for one do not ever believe the remarks of people in the Parliament who say they live on the minimum wage gross before tax.  Their standard of living does not justify these remarks.  They will say it, and some of their supporters will believe it, and it is a mantra.</p>  <p>  Perhaps it is a little politically unpopular to say it, but I love giving facts now and again, and I looked at the total cost for next year of salaries for Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Chairmen of committees, travel and accommodation allowances for Deputies, the public representation allowance for Deputies and other allowances for Deputies and the same for Members of the Seanad, and out of the &euro;131 million this comes to &euro;30 million, which is 23% of the cost of the Oireachtas.  Some people will have it that it costs &euro;131 million to run the Oireachtas, when in fact only 23% of this goes to Deputies and Senators, and this includes running constituency offices and everything involved in it.  It is quite a low proportion.  Even if I add in the cost of the pensions of former Members it brings it up to approximately one third of the overall budget.  The figure also includes salaries in respect of Members of the European Parliament.  Payments to Deputies and politicians and the costs of running their constituencies and constituency offices represent approximately 25% of what we are speaking about.  Some people would like to think it is an enormous figure, but 25% in respect of the Members with regard to running the overall business of the Oireachtas is not too severe.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to a number of specific issues.  There is to be a massive increase in consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews next year, from &euro;800,000 to &euro;2.5 million.  I would love to know why.  The termination allowances in respect of former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas is planned to be &euro;3.388 million.</p></speech>

I would love to see more detail on the costs of the banking inquiry.  I know it is not possible to achieve it in this short time.  I would like to see more details on the cost of the parliamentary legal advisory service and I will write directly to the Ceann Comhairle on this matter.  As a Deputy I am not happy with how the system works.  The Ceann Comhairle can obtain legal advice from the service on discussing motions in the Chamber, and he will allow a debate depending on the legal advice.  Various committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts and the banking inquiry are smothered with legal advice and are told what they can and cannot do, but when Members come here to vote in the Chamber on a Bill with possible constitutional implications no legal advice is available.  Members of the Government have the advice of the Attorney General, but Members of the Parliament casting their votes are unable to receive individual legal advice.  This service needs to be available to all Members and not just to the Ceann Comhairle and select committees.</p></speech>

N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ag iarraidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta chun gear&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh, ach chun a mheabhr&uacute; do dhaoine nach bhfuil gach uile ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ar Choimisi&uacute;n Thithe an Oireachtais.  The minutes of the commission are available online, but this does not take away from the fact quite a portion of Deputies are not represented on it, which means one is not represented in the day to day running of the House.  This is a criticism I have repeated since the commission was established.  We should try as much as possible, without making it unwieldy, for the commission to be fully reflective, so all of the parties in the House, and that includes staff, play a role in ensuring the services the Houses of the Oireachtas give us day in day out are the best possible services.</p>  <p>  We are in a different era to 50 years ago.  Much more is expected of us as parliamentarians than would have been expected even ten years ago.  The access the public now has to Deputies and Senators is much faster and much more demanding than when I was first elected in 2002.  When I was first elected the majority of my correspondence was through letters and now it is through e-mail.  E-mail, and social media in particular, demand much quicker responses.  They also demand us to be much more transparent and open in our activities.  We are a window into the Irish Parliament for the world.  This includes Ireland and elsewhere.  When I go back to my office I might have a text message or an e-mail from an Irish citizen in some far-flung part of the world who might pass comment, as people often do.  It might not be about me, it might be that the D&aacute;il looked very grubby today.  It can be this mundane.  People look in and expect us as a Parliament to carry out our work as parliamentarians but also expect us to have the facilities.</p>  <p>  There is a cost involved and there are people, in particular sometimes the media, who can be overly critical of the cost of democracy.  They do not know it sometimes, but it does cost.  We have a figure for an Estimate, part of which I presume will include, or if not will definitely include next year, the cost of securing the building.  We were told almost ten years ago that in the morning this building could fall down around us.  I do not think the general public internationally would want it to fall down, unless some of us were in it perhaps, as that is the way some people look at it.  There is a cost involved.  It is an old building and it will cost money to fix it to ensure we carry out the work people sent us here to do in the first place.  People need to remember they sent us here.  They have a choice every number of years to send us back.</p>  <p>  It is a useful mechanism that once a year the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission puts forward its annual budget and that it gets a cursory debate at the very least because it is a big sum of money.  People need to remember it covers the cost of more than 400 staff and 226 Deputies and Senators, and the running of an old building which is inefficient and everything else that goes with it.  I congratulate the work everybody has done in recent times to cut costs such as electricity.  We need to spend more on modernising our facilities to ensure we can capture the new world out there through social media.  This is not a criticism of the Houses of the Oireachtas PR team which does a lot.  We all do much but we can do a lot more.  I am not opposed to the budget.  It reflects where we are today.  Last year's annual accounts showed we underspent what was allocated, which in some way sets the agenda.  We need modernised facilities, so if something is starting to creak at the seams we need to fix it.</p></speech>

It is a significant issue, as the body is made up of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il, with Sinn F&eacute;in, the Technical Group and other Independents excluded.  There may be a different set of priorities as a result.  For example, in considering the Oireachtas committees, I believe there is a need to beef up the secretariat so it could do more meaningful work.  That is an example of how there is not really an opportunity for us to make any kind of input into the process.</p>  <p>  The Minister might recall the issue I have continuously raised regarding the Technical Group and the changing nature of its mandate.  If opinion polls are to be believed, although we do not know, there could be a very different make-up to the D&aacute;il next time but what has happened does not reflect that.  I spent a long time going back and forth to the Minister's office trying to achieve some changes to a particular piece of legislation so a group recognised in Standing Orders, the Technical Group, could get a small number of staff resources to run the group.  For example, the group is comparable in size to Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il, which has in the order of 20 staff provided for the running of parliamentary activities.  The Technical Group does not get anyone.</p>  <p>  The Minister was quite helpful to me in writing a letter with which I went to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  That stated it was entirely within the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to change or revise the regulations currently in place, within budgetary constraints placed upon it.  It indicated that although the Technical Group is not a party and, therefore, cannot be allocated resources as if it was, the commission may, if it sees fit, make new regulations to allow for the specific provision of additional facilities to individual members or parties to comprise the Technical Group.</p>  <p>  With a group of 17 or 18 Members, some managing is required, even to organise somebody to answer the phone or e-mails and ensure that people are allocated to committees, etc.  This cannot be done otherwise.  The Technical Group made an arrangement in which it became the private employer of two people, so this could be achieved.  However, this should have been unnecessary as such a resource should have been provided.  It will not be provided within this D&aacute;il.  It is absolutely wrong that a different approach is taken because of the mandate despite the fact that the citizen is sovereign and has the choice in sending people to this House.  It is absolutely outrageous that the Technical Group can be so underprovided for.  The Minister's helpful letter was sent to me on 1 April 2014 and I felt I was made a fool of in the run-around I got on this issue.  The feedback from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which required much effort to get, was that the only way in which we could be provided with resources was if I, as the Technical Group Whip, was disabled.  That is the kind of nonsensical approach that must be changed if we are to respect the mandate and its make-up now and in future.</p>  <p>  I do not have a great deal of insight into how the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission works or where its priorities lie.  Two thirds of the Opposition do not have input into it, which is a glaring democratic gap, given how essential are the facilities.  It may well be that if there were contrarian views on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the money or resources would be allocated in an entirely different way.  For example, there might be a much more powerful committee system if there were resources to do something that is now impossible because of the generous but limited resources available.</p></speech>

We have come a long way from when the water charges were first mooted to be introduced by this Government, when there were many threats and much bullying talk, which was summed up when the former Minister, Commissioner Hogan, threatened to reduce water to a trickle for anybody who could not or would not pay the water charges.  The Government's strident and confident approach to trying to introduce these regressive and unfair charges has disappeared in the face of a mass popular movement that has brought unprecedented numbers of people out on the streets and forced the Government into a series of humiliating U-turns on charges.</p>  <p>  The threat to turn off people's water or reduce it to a trickle was disgraceful for anybody to even consider when we are talking about a basic human right and something that people need to exist.  That threat was taken off the table and the amount of the charge was reduced, with a cap introduced for the charges in order to essentially appease the popular rebellion taking place on the streets as the Government backtracked.  This Bill, along with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 that we dealt with a week ago - in essence, a new Bill shoehorned into an older Bill at the last minute - are a further admission that this Government is just terrified of the massive movement against water charges.  It is so terrified that it has had to hide anything to do with those water charges inside an apparently innocuous Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  It meant that Bill, along with the legislation now being discussed, could be put into the last couple of weeks of the D&aacute;il term so as to avoid creating any focus for the anti-water charges movement to mobilise on yet again.</p>  <p>  I am absolutely sure the Government was aware that there was a plan to have demonstrations when this legislation appeared and it did its best to try to minimise the time we would have to mobilise significant numbers.  Hence, the effort to smuggle some matters to do with water charges into the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 at the last minute and ram this Bill through in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>The public needs to recognise its own power and the fact that the Government is quaking in its boots in the face of the sort of mobilisations we have seen over the last year or so.  The fact that Irish Water will not give out the figures on how many people have paid or not paid speaks for itself.  It indicates that there is an unprecedented mass action of peaceful civil disobedience going on across the country.  Regardless of the attempts by this Government to manipulate the D&aacute;il timetable, to play fast and loose with the whole legislative process, and to spin and propagandise about the power it has or intends to give itself to deal with that boycott, the reality is that, just as the people of Greece had the courage to say "No" when faced with the bullying and threats of the troika and Angela Merkel, hundreds of thousands have the courage to say "No" to this Government's attempt to impose a totally regressive and unfair austerity tax, and they are clearly doing so in droves by refusing to pay these water bills.</p> <p> Against that background, what we have in this legislation is an attempt to make people think the Government has powers that it does not have to undermine that boycott.  That is what this legislation is all about.  Again, it is smuggled in in an apparently progressive move.  One aspect of this is progressive, namely, the removal of the threat of imprisonment for people who are unable to pay small debts.  That is a progressive measure, although the add-on of attachment orders, under which employers would be asked to make deductions from people's earnings, is an absolute disgrace.  Employers would effectively be given a political profile of their employees.  If they are, as hundreds of thousands are, engaged in an act of political protest by refusing to pay water charges, their employers will be given that information by the courts, with all the potential ramifications that could have for individuals.  It also applies in the case of bills that people might simply have been unable to pay because they are poor, because they are low-paid, because they are on zero-hour or low-hour contracts, or for whatever reason.  The Government is proposing to give people's employers the information that they have been unable to pay debts and have had court orders made against them to the effect that their employers are to deduct those unpaid debts.  That is a pretty disgraceful move.</p> <p> This is another in a very long litany of utterly treacherous things for the Labour Party to do.  For the Labour Party to give an employer that kind of information, detail and power over an employee is nauseating.  However, we should not be surprised by a further betrayal by the Labour Party, which has given up even any slight pretence of being a progressive, left-wing party with the things it has done and the betrayals it has perpetrated over the last few years.</p> <p> That is a disgraceful element of this legislation, but the key characteristic of the legislation is that the Government is trying to kick the whole thing down the road.  It is trying to shoehorn this Bill into a short period of time, misrepresent what is actually in it, and then kick the substantial issue of how to deal with a mass boycott down the line until after a general election.  This is an act of political cowardice of the highest order.  What I want to say to the many people who are opposed to water charges and who have been on the protests is that it proves how powerful this movement is.  People need to understand that this sort of power, which can make the Government run, hide, kick cans down the road, manipulate, spin and mess around with the legislative process, shows that people are winning and that if they maintain the boycott and the massive mobilisations on the streets over the coming months, these water charges can be defeated and the Government that introduced them can be swept out of office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700033#FF00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Civil Debt Bill 2015, which I will be opposing.  The Government has argued that the Bill is commendable and came about as a result of recommendations from the Law Reform Commission.  At least one section of the Bill is to be welcomed by all Members of the House - namely, the abolition of imprisonment for non-payment of debt.  This puts an end to the shameful situation whereby a person could be taken to court and then imprisoned for not paying for a television licence.  Maybe, with an election coming up, the Government has grown a conscience.  Maybe it has simply woken up to the sad fact that the prison services cannot cope with the number of people imprisoned for non-payment of fines.</p>  <p>  This Bill is not about civil debt at all.  It is about Irish Water.  Faced with massive non-payment and non-registration for Irish Water, the Government is running scared.  The people are winning.  In response, the Government is scaremongering by suggesting people will be taken to court for non-payment of water charges.  It is trying to bully and scare people into paying for water, which they already do in the form of general taxation.  People will not be fooled into paying for their water twice.</p>  <p>  The Minister will say this Bill is not about Irish Water, but that is exactly what it is about.  The Government is trying to punish those people who cannot afford to pay another bill.  It is not interested in giving people options.  It wants to leave people with no choice but to capitulate.  Yet again, the Government seriously underestimates the will of the Irish people and the strength of the non-payment campaign.  Irish Water is in fact already dead in the water and this Bill is just another desperate attempt by the Government to buoy it up by ramming this legislation through before the summer recess.  It is initiating debates on non-regular sitting days, changing the names of Bills, changing sections at the last minute, and guillotining real and frank debate on these issues.  One of the major reforms we were to see when this Government came to power was that the guillotine would not be used or would only be used very sparingly.  In fact, it has been used more often during this D&aacute;il than during the previous one.  That shows the Government's disregard for the democratic process and its arrogance in the face of large-scale opposition to water charges.  It can be seen in this Bill.</p>  <p>  Rather than go after the real architects of the recession in our country, it is going after the little people - the soft targets - and it is going after them for the shirt off their backs.  The big debtors to the Irish economy were given write-downs and debt forgiveness worth billions, while ordinary people can now be taken to court for a debt of as little as &euro;500.</p><p>With the Civil Debt Bill 2015, the Government has once again pinned its colours to the mast and sided with huge utility companies and multinational corporations rather than with the ordinary people.  They have chosen to enact this legislation to help creditors rather than debtors.  The hypocrisy of this Government has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>As has been the case with nearly everything else the Government has done, this Bill will have an impact on those who are already vulnerable, such as women, those on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare.  This, of course, should come as no surprise, considering the Government's track record in this regard, which seemed particularly evident last week with the cruel and regressive cuts to the lone parent allowance and the utter disdain for those on low incomes voiced by one of the Government Deputies last week, which was so base that I will not attempt to repeat it.<br/><br/>Those people who struggle to survive on a daily basis are the most vulnerable to falling into debt.  A cycle of constant indebtedness is a real possibility when, in paying off one debt, a person falls into another, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty that represses ordinary people in this country.  In case the Government needs any reminder in this regard, this week the Living Wage Technical Group published the findings of its research, which showed that people in Ireland need to earn &euro;450 a week to be able to afford an acceptable standard of living.  This equates to an hourly rate of &euro;11.50, which means a living wage is one third higher than the minimum wage, which is set at &euro;8.65 an hour for an adult.  There are many thousands of Irish citizens who do not earn a living wage and are living on well below &euro;450 a week.  They are the ones who are being targeted by the Government while the bankers and their friends get off scot free.<br/><br/>A seemingly welcome aspect of the Bill is that it makes it clear that water charges cannot be deducted at source; they cannot be taken directly from people's incomes and social welfare.  Instead, the Bill provides that each case must be heard in court before an attachment order can be granted.  That means that each and every case involving a person who is taking part in the massive campaign to boycott water charges must be heard in court, something that simply cannot be done.  All of their finances must be looked at and they can appeal the ruling.  Of course, they cannot be taken to court for at least two years on the basis of the &euro;500.  Those who are indebted to the tune of only &euro;500 are hardly likely to be able to pay for legal representation.  How are the vulnerable to be represented in the courts?  Will they be dependent on free legal aid and will they get it?  This Bill, if enacted, will be completely unworkable.<br/><br/>The Bill allows creditors, including Irish Water, to apply to the court for an order enabling an attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments for the purpose of the enforcement of debt of as little as &euro;500.  This will disproportionately target those on low pay and persons in receipt of social welfare payments.  There is no requirement in the legislation that a creditor must first exhaust other avenues before resorting to taking a person to court.  In this regard, I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Pringle, when he stated last Friday:<blockquote>People must be afforded an opportunity to enter into a payment plan to allow them to reduce their debt without having to go before the courts.<br /><br />On attachment orders for people in receipt of social welfare payments, the Bill is unclear about the level at which attachment orders may be made against social welfare payments.  ... Without ... a threshold, the courts may place people in even greater financial difficulty by allowing attachment orders to be made which would reduce a social welfare payment to an amount below the level required to survive.</blockquote>Any reasonable and responsible creditor will help a person pay his or her debt by way of delaying the repayment, freezing interest rates or accepting payment by instalments.  The legislation before the House today does not impose on creditors any obligation to offer debtors a payment plan or require them to enter into payment with a debtor before seeking to secure a payment order for the debt in court.  The creditor can immediately opt to take a person to court.  This, of course, is reckless.  The Bill completely ignores this.<br/><br/>I believe this Bill is unworkable, will not be successful if it is implemented, and will ensure that there is increased opposition to these unjust and unfair water charges, which represent more austerity for ordinary people.</p></speech>

One has to cut through a lot of the hyperbole, the rhetoric, the inflammatory language and the images that are put before the House, such as what I have heard in the past ten or fifteen minutes, and look at the reality behind the introduction of this Bill.  It appeared as a recommendation from the Free Legal Advice Centres, as far back as 2009, in its report entitled To No One's Credit.  It was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2010.  It appeared in my party's manifesto before the 2011 general election, at which we were elected as the largest party.  It subsequently appeared in the programme for Government in 2011.  If there is a criticism, it should be that it has taken this long to bring it before the House in 2015.  As a matter of fact, a predecessor of mine from Cork South-West, the former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, when spokesperson for justice, introduced a Private Members' Bill advocating more or less exactly what is in the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill.  Therefore, it has been knocking around for some time on the recommendation of some very respected bodies.  It will be opposed, despite the fact that last year alone we committed almost 9,000 people to prison for non-payment of fines or civil debts.</p>  <p>  We can continue to imprison people.  We can continue to incarcerate them and take away their liberty for something as trivial as non-payment of a fine or, in the case of part of this Bill, non-payment of a debt, but there is something fundamentally wrong with this.  There is something fundamentally unfair about denying people their liberty, in many cases giving them terms of several months in prison despite the fact that that is not what they will serve.  In almost all cases, they will be out within hours or, in worse cases, days.  The fact that they have been imprisoned remains, and goes against their name and on their records.  It works against them in their communities.  The option of an attachment order on earnings - or, indeed, where possible, on social welfare payments, although this would be minimal - has been proposed by many different agencies and organisations for a number of years.</p>  <p>  I also welcomed the previous legislation that we enacted.  I believe it will have a chilling effect on those who deliberately decide to avail of a service or deal in goods from a business or agency and not pay for it, despite the fact that it is clearly illegal and a breach of contract.  It is fine if people want to oppose the Bill and say they support that, but we as public representatives have a strong responsibility to say we uphold the law that is passed in this Chamber, particularly when that law has been put before the people as part of a manifesto and included in a programme for Government.</p><p>We cannot call ourselves democrats only to be <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>democrats and say that this is the part of democracy we like but that is the part we can do without because it does not support our agenda, or that we can shoehorn it into a different forum.  One can call it street protest or whatever one likes, but advocating it is irresponsible and does no justice to anyone elected to the House who claims to be democratic.  It does not matter whether people believe in democratic objectives for Ireland, or any other country to which they travel advocating for democracy, justice and civil rights and claiming to have a mandate.  We have a mandate for this.  We agreed it, but, lo and behold, when we have before us a very sensible and pragmatic proposal to allow for the smooth running of business the length and breadth of the country, those who advocate most in this House for democratic principles, justice, equality and fairness oppose the Bill and talk about hypocrisy in the same breath.  They need to reflect on what they have said, what we have proposed and what we said before the general election, and then consider what &quot;hypocrisy&quot; really means.<br/><br/>Do we want to bring people from all over the country to Mountjoy to be incarcerated for a couple of hours before giving them their fares back to wherever they come from, be it west Cork, Donegal or any other community, when we can instead tell them that if they do not live up to their contractual obligations, the matter will be brought before a judge, who will make an order that they be penalised financially?  People have been calling for this for years.</p></speech>

It is obvious that this is a desperate attempt to follow on from the undemocratic process with which the Government rammed through the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week, all in the hope that outstanding issues relating to the water charges disaster would be tied up before the summer recess and would not need to be debated in the autumn before a possible election.  People can see right through this.  They see what the Government is trying to do and will remember this come election time.  The fight against the Government's unjust water taxes is far from over.  Those in the Government will not sweep the matter under the carpet, because the people, and those of us in the House who stand up for them, will not let them.</p><p>Claims to the effect that the Bill has come from the Law Reform Commission, that it does not apply to debts to moneylenders, that it is a necessary step to solve a civil debt problem, that the courts have safeguards in place to afford protection, and the great line that it differentiates between those who cannot pay and those who will not, are spin to avoid admitting the Bill's real purpose.  I have yet to see how the Bill differentiates in any meaningful way between those who cannot pay and those who will not.  The Government's spin does not address any of the real concerns.</p><p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to quotes from the speech of the Minister for Justice and Equality at the launch of the report of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, yesterday.  She stated:<blockquote>Many, many people obviously want to pay their debts, and those who can pay them will pay them.  No reasonable person will resent seeing someone who has fallen on hard times benefit from proportionate debt forgiveness.</blockquote>The hypocrisy is unbelievable.  The Government is in favour of debt forgiveness by legislating for a mechanism to take unpaid debt directly from a person's wages or social welfare.  How does this work?  The Bill is an obvious attempt to target those on low pay or social welfare.  We are discussing sums that are relatively small for those in the higher echelons of society.  For ordinary people, though, debts of this level have a serious impact on their lives.  These are the people who will be targeted disproportionately.</p><p>The Government is afraid that its Irish Water plans are coming apart at the seams.  The truth is that they are.  The Bill is intimidation on the Government's part.  It is an underhanded attempt to transform the Government's fear about Irish Water into the people's fear that they may be dragged before the courts for their accumulated debts.  People are not naive; they can see through this.</p><p>What the Bill deals with is legislatively unnecessary and avoidable, or at least, it was until the Government needed such a mechanism in order to prop up the power of its own creditor, Irish Water.  Let me be clear: Irish Water must be abolished, and there should be no need for recovery of unpaid charges at all.</p><p>Regarding other creditors, Sinn F&eacute;in opposes the Bill because it does not require creditors to consider whether there is a more appropriate way to deal with disputes before rushing to the courts, further clogging the system, to get legal orders against persons in debt.  Civil debt is a serious strain on anyone.  The Bill seeks to punish those who fall into this trap, mostly those on low wages or social welfare who are already living on the poverty line, by giving creditors the option to drag them before a judge without any need to try to solve the dispute through a less adversarial method.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted amendments to the Bill for consideration on Committee Stage.  They are simple.  Of the 27 sections, only one is of merit.  Section 26 repeals Parts I and IV of the Debtors Act (Ireland) 1872.  It is the only section that we support.</p><p>I wish to address some of the bizarre comments made by Deputy Catherine Byrne on Friday.  She must have seen some of the media coverage over the weekend and realised the stupidity of her comments and just how far removed she is from the majority of citizens in the State.  It must be difficult for her stretching her budget in such a way.  After all, one could hardly fill a shopping basket on a basic salary of &euro;87,000 per year.  Deputy Catherine Byrne, in referencing this Bill, stated that people had a civic responsibility to pay debts, including debts relating to water charges.  I am happy that she acknowledged this, but how does an increase in the pensions of former Taoisigh and Ministers contribute to their civic responsibility?  How does a ministerial pay increase contribute?  I am sure the Deputy will be delighted that she, too, can now afford a little luxury by way of a bottle of wine at the weekend, with a salary increase on the cards for Deputies as well.  It is insulting to suggest that the low-paid and those on welfare, whom this Bill targets, have not paid their way.  Do Government Deputies even bother to read their e-mails or talk to people in their constituencies?</p><p>In case Deputy Catherine Byrne is oblivious to how her voting record in this D&aacute;il has forced those on low pay or welfare to contribute to their civic responsibility more than any other sector of society, here are some statistics to help her understand.  They were compiled by Dr. Rory Hearne and published at the weekend.  The eight austerity budgets between 2008 and 2014 involved &euro;18.5 billion in cuts to public spending.  Public service staff numbers have been reduced by 37,500, or 10%.  The health budget has seen a 27% cut, with an 81% increase in the number of patients on trolleys in hospital waiting rooms.  Funding for local authority housing was cut from &euro;1.3 billion in 2007 to just &euro;83 million in 2013.  There were cuts to lone parent payments, which happened last week, as well as to child benefit and fuel allowance, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, rent supplement, and disability and carer's allowances.  There have been extra charges for households, including water, property, school transport, prescription and third level fees, on top of an increase in living costs.</p><p>There has been a 50% cut to community, youth and rural development schemes.  The obvious result has been hundreds of thousands of families pushed into poverty.  Food poverty in Ireland affects 600,000 people.  Are these the people that Deputy Byrne believes are filling their trolleys with drink?  I hope the Deputy realises how much hurt her comments have caused to hundreds of thousands of struggling people who have more than paid off their civic responsibility.  This Bill aims to bleed such people dry for the benefit of Irish Water in cases where there may be some unpaid debt.  The points raised by Deputy Byrne raise serious questions about the mindset of this Government.  I suggest that her insulting remarks expose a deeper problem, which is the Government's belief that it has the power to dictate to people in this State how they should live their lives and what they can and cannot afford.  This is indicative of the Government's mindset on the very purpose of this Bill.  The Government appears to believe it is acceptable to draft legislation to dictate to people how much money should be deducted from their hard-earned wages and how that money should be spent.  This is not how democracy works.  It is certainly not the right way for the Government to deal with its water charge failures.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will submit amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  We will not support the Bill as it is.  It must be amended to delete all sections which advocate a flawed approach to the recovery of debt.  An adversarial approach is not the way forward.  The only section of merit in the entire Bill is that providing for the abolition of the imprisonment of debtors, which is a sensible proposal.  The rest of the Bill misses the bigger picture.  It is unnecessary and ruthless to allow companies, including Irish Water, to use bully tactics to recover debt in this way.  It is not the direction that legal resolutions are heading in.  For the most part, the courts are heading down a path of mediation and dispute resolution.  To allow creditors to use the courts as a first option, as this Bill does, undermines the direction the courts are taking.  It is not an acceptable way for the Government to deal with the problem it will face in trying to enforce the unjust and unfair water tax that has been imposed on our people.</p></speech>

Under the Haddington Road agreement, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and this Government have agreed that former Ministers and taoisigh will get significant increases in their five-figure and six-figure pensions, which are already substantial.  Citizens are understandably outraged.  L&eacute;argas eile is ea &eacute; seo ar an gcaoi ina bhfuil dl&iacute; amh&aacute;in ann do dhaoine saibhre agus dl&iacute; eile do dhaoine eile.  This Government has imposed four years of austerity.  Citizens face a range of new bills for water charges, property taxes and septic tank charges.  VAT bills have increased and there has been a general increase in consumption taxes.  There has also been forced emigration.</p>  <p>  This Government has deliberately planned for a low wage economy.  It is responsible for the worst trolley figures in our hospitals for more than 12 years, with 333 citizens on trolleys across the State today, including 35 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is in my constituency.  There has been a general rundown in public services.  The number of children living in poverty has doubled.  It is estimated that 12,000 lone parent families, including many in my constituency, are facing significant cuts of up to &euro;86 per week as a result of a decision taken by Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies last week.  We learned yesterday that Dublin City Council is facing an &euro;18.5 million shortfall as it seeks to tackle the growing homeless problem in the city and will run out of money in October.  Some 67 families were made homeless in Dublin in May.  A further 65 families were made homeless in June.  Cialla&iacute;onn na staitistic&iacute; seo go bhfuil breis is 1,000 p&aacute;iste gan d&iacute;dean.</p>  <p>  The Government is adding to its litany of bad decisions and misery today by guillotining the debate on the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill 2015 in this House.  This regressive legislation targets the low-paid by enabling applications to be made for attachment orders that will allow money to be taken out of wages, welfare payments and pensions to pay for water charges, credit debts and other utility bills.  When the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, joined the Labour Party in his first flush of idealism, thereby signing up to the great historic party of James Connolly, I wonder whether he thought he would be sitting in this Chamber to shepherd through such a Bill.  This is a reactionary Government's reactionary response to the popular outrage at the imposition of water charges.  No similar legislation has been introduced in response to corruption, white-collar crime or the despicable behaviour of the insiders in the golden circle, about which we hear every day.</p>  <p>  As a result of this Bill, families struggling to make ends meet will have their incomes reduced further.  This law and the stigma attached to it will become another hurdle for people who are seeking work.  It is a bad Bill for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be tasked with implementing it.  In effect, the Government is forcing employers to become debt collectors and debt payees for the State, just as it did with landlords.  It is also forcing them to become involved with the courts.  This legislation will empower the courts to make an order directing an employer to deduct certain specified amounts from the debtor's earnings and to pay the sums deducted in the manner specified to the creditor.  Some 70% of workers outside the public sector are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now facing an additional bureaucratic and expensive administrative burden.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, said on Friday that the Bill "will not be directed at those who cannot pay but rather at those who can pay but choose not to", but she knows it will be used against people in debt who cannot pay.  Everybody knows that.  If one owes money for gas, electricity, Christmas presents, a communion dress, a washing machine or beds or other furniture, all of one's creditors will be able to take one to court and seek to have money taken from one's welfare, pensions or wages.  Deputy Catherine Byrne has argued that this is an entirely appropriate way to deal with people who spend all their money on drink and cigarettes.  The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill 2015 is essentially another bill for desperate families and citizens to pay.  I thought of concluding by saying the Labour Party should be ashamed of endorsing this Bill, but that would be a waste of time.  Last week, it voted to take money from the pockets and purses of thousands of lone parents.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, former Ministers and taoisigh will gain more than the low-paid under the Haddington Road agreement.  This means that Ministers, including those who are bringing through this Bill, will get more out of the Haddington Road agreement than low-paid workers who will have this legislation used against them.

On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this legislation.  I might use the time available to me to remind the House of the main features of the Bill.  It will abolish imprisonment for non-payment of debt and provide for two new District Court measures for the recovery of modest debts.  These fair and balanced measures will ensure the ability of debtor to pay the debt is considered as a key element of the court process.  The Bill will ensure that debtors are not subject to attachment or deduction orders which will bring their income levels below a reasonable standard.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that the contributions of many Opposition Deputies concentrated on matters which are not related to the Bill itself.  Some Deputies made comments that suggest they would prefer if people broke the law rather than meeting their commitments.  I remind the House that this Bill applies to a wide range of creditors and not just to Irish Water.  I would need more than another minute to do justice to the script that has been prepared for me.</p><p>It is a basic part of democracy to support citizens who pay their way and to make legislative options available for citizens who are owed money by giving them the legislative supports for its recovery.  The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill is a balanced measure which provides creditors with improved enforcement mechanisms in respect of modest debts, but also provides strong safeguards for debtors.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700038#LL00800"><p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;let&rdquo; to insert the following:<br /><br />&quot;, and in the case of land under the <i>de facto </i>care and control of the National Asset Management Agency the latter shall be deemed to be the owner for the purposes of this Act&quot;.</blockquote>I thank the Minister of State for accepting a suggestion I made on Second Stage that an amendment be made to ensure local authorities are also subject to the rigours of the legislation and, where necessary, required to endure the pain, so to speak, of paying a vacant site levy.  I propose this amendment in the same spirit.  The purpose of the amendment is to extend the definition of the term &quot;owner&quot; to include property which is in the <i>de facto</i>care and control of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. </p><p>One of the main objectives of the Bill is to assist in addressing the housing shortage by tackling the hoarding of property.  The National Asset Management Agency is the largest property company in the world and controls massive land banks in this country by virtue of its dealings with property developers.  When NAMA was established in 2009, the Department of Finance projected that 30,000 new houses would be required annually in the medium term.  Considering the reach of the agency and given its control of a large number of development sites as a result of acquiring the assets of developers, it is reasonable to expect it to play a key role in delivering this housing.  Regrettably, however, NAMA has failed in this regard.  </p><p>The National Asset Management Agency blows its own trumpet because it has a target of completing 4,500 new housing units in Dublin by 2016 and 20,000 housing units in the greater Dublin area in the next five years.  These figures will be only a drop in the ocean given the extent of the housing shortage and house building requirements.  Given its control of many development sites, NAMA should have played a significant role in addressing the housing shortage by funding and working with developers to this end.  Its failure to do so is a key reason for the housing shortage.  If the agency had done what it should have been doing, we would have more houses.  </p><p>A large of amount of land is being hoarded and remains undeveloped.  NAMA is not working with developers, many of whom will tell stories about the difficulties they have experienced in dealing with the agency.  Many matters of concern have been aired in public without any answers being provided by NAMA.  Mr. Justice Cregan, for example, seriously chastised NAMA in the High Court on the basis of its dealings with the developer, Mr. John Flynn, while the portfolio of another developer, Mr. Michael O'Flynn, was not sold to the highest bidder.</p><p>The objective of the amendment is to bring some accountability in respect to the National Asset Management Agency by ensuring it is not above the law that applies to ordinary private property owners who may find themselves obliged to pay a vacant site levy.</p><p>In view of that, I ask the Minister of State to give the matter serious consideration.  I understand that the definition of "owner" is the ordinary one, but the position for these developers and property owners is that NAMA has all the say in relation to what happens to their properties.  As such, NAMA should be brought in as part of the solution to address our housing shortage.</p></speech>

This would create extra cost.  We are adding an extra cost on in terms of NAMA and the properties that are there, in particular when it comes to the levies.  As such, I do not see the purpose of the amendment and will oppose it.</p></speech>

While she does not say so explicitly, it is an implicit and severe indictment of the Government because it has allowed NAMA to behave in the way it has.  Many of us on this side of the House have been saying since we arrived here and the Government took office that NAMA should have been transferring much more land and property directly to local authorities to provide social housing.  The Government simply did not listen.  We have got a derisory social dividend from NAMA and that failure is one of the major contributory factors to the catastrophic social housing crisis we face.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the horse has, to a very large extent, bolted and a levy does not really deal with it.  What should happen is a simple change of NAMA's entire mandate or to have all available housing and land that could be used for social housing immediately transferred to local authorities.  Any cash that NAMA generates should provide the capital for a major social housing construction programme instead of being used to pay off bonds.  While a lot of the money has been used to redeem its bonds, at one stage when NAMA appeared before a committee, it had &euro;4 billion in cash reserves.  That money could have financed a serious social housing programme.  Recently, its cash reserves have been reduced considerably because NAMA has used the money to redeem bonds.  We could have put billions of euro into a social housing programme but did not.  I do not know the latest position but maybe the Minister of State can enlighten the House.  Do we have an estimate of how much more cash NAMA will generate from the off-loading of land and properties before it is due to dissolve itself?  What are we doing with that money?  Why do we not say now that the money will be used as the capital for a serious emergency programme of direct social housing provision?</p>  <p>  A levy will just not cut it at this stage.  It will not make any difference.  The big question is the mandate the Government gives NAMA.  That mandate should change so that NAMA is not there simply to unload big lots of land or property to whoever it can sell to just for money.  The whole mandate should be geared around the provision of social housing and resolving the housing crisis.  If its mandate is not changed in those terms, NAMA should be dissolved and everything it has simply given to local authorities.  As we will discuss in more detail later, even if we did that, the Government would still have to provide the money for a serious social housing programme.  Despite all of the spin and propaganda of the Government about the billions of euro to be applied before 2017 and 2020, one finds when one looks at the detail of the Government's social housing strategy 2020 that there will be no big social housing building programme.  Approximately 85% to 90% of what the Government is doing is outsourcing to the private sector.  Given the scale of the crisis, that means the stealth privatisation of social housing will be the long-term effect of the Government's policy, including in the legislation before the House.  It is to Deputy Mulherin's credit that she points to the issue of NAMA and what it has not been doing and should be doing, but this particular amendment will simply not deal with the problem.  The problem is one of Government policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700039#MM00400"><p>I also commend Deputy Mulherin, which is not something that happens too often, for raising the serious underperformance of NAMA.  Aside from what seem to be a lot of spurious deals where it appears the taxpayer could have fared a great deal better, NAMA is actually boasting that it will make approximately &euro;1 billion in profit over the six to eight year period.  That still leaves the taxpayer about &euro;40 billion short.  Given that the market has been rising for a while, it is outrageous that more was not realised.</p>  <p>  The point the Deputy made about the social dividend and NAMA's failure to provide it is a frightening one.  What is really uncomfortable is the fact that we have a serious level of inconsistency in how NAMA has done its business.  Sometimes it applies its rules rigidly and sometimes it does not.  A simple example is that of the Dublin GAA trying to get hold of the Spawell but failing to do so.  It beggars belief that a sporting organisation in Ireland would not have been facilitated and given a little bit of an extra chance.  It is not like the GAA was going to make money on it.  It intended to provide a social outlet for young people and should have been helped by NAMA.  NAMA will argue that it is under an obligation to maximise the potential of the asset for the taxpayer.  When it makes that argument, I would like NAMA to explain its approach when a bidder went to buy not the loans but the debt of the Chicago Spire, which was at $78 million plus costs which brought it to approximately $93 million.  An investor sought to buy the debt, and this was every penny that was owed to the bank.  This was not the reduced value, but the par value.</p><p>In other words, this investor was prepared to pay the debt in full but NAMA gave it to Jones Lang LaSalle in New York to sell.  This was a site in Chicago.  Even if NAMA thought it could get more for it, it was not in New York that it would have got it.  It would have been interesting if it had marketed it in Chicago.  Why could NAMA not accept the debt being bought out?  It is estimated that it was sold for $35 million.  NAMA refused $78 million, plus the cost, and it accepted a figure in the region of &euro;35 million.  That was claimed to be in the interests of the taxpayer in the same way as NAMA not accepting the bid from Dublin GAA for the Spawell because it claimed it was maximising the potential of the asset.</p> <p> It is horrendous that NAMA could not deliver housing units for Dublin, in particular where there is such a serious housing crisis.  It beggars belief.  The argument was spun that certain property was not really suitable.  The funny thing about that is that NAMA did not want to give much of the property that was suitable to the State because it was attractive to investors.  What has happened is that vulture funds, mostly from the US, were allowed to cherry pick the best of it because NAMA sought to sell the best of it to them.  It then considered some of the other property, which was not quite as attractive to the vulture funds, for social or affordable housing.</p> <p> NAMA is a State body over which governments - this one and the previous one - do not seem to have much control.  Issues are raised about it.  The idea that the Comptroller and Auditor General has it all in hand beggars belief.  I have seen too many things which I do not believe the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen, and I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is honest.  It would be an incredible challenge for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the few people working with him to keep tabs on everything that is happening within NAMA.  It would be a massive challenge, and it is not only about auditing.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have expertise in the area of markets, construction and the future potential of assets?  Does he have all those people working for him in order to be able to test the waters and ensure NAMA is doing what is best for the taxpayer at every turn?  It is asking way to much of the Comptroller and Auditor General to think that he could come up with all those answers.  He would be an amazing man, irrespective of how many people he had working with him.</p> <p> Sadly, there is now the idea that the Committee of Public Accounts can examine this, behind which the Government can hide, as if it is an Oireachtas investigation and the committee will see if everything is all right.  That is not what will happen.  If those in government want to know the truth and if they really want to know if the taxpayer was best served in these deals, they will eventually have to initiate an independent inquiry into the workings of NAMA.  It is extremely important because not only are we dealing with things that have happened - people must be held responsible for what they have done - but there are so many assets still to be sold.  Will that be done right?  At present, we do not know and given that NAMA remains a secret society, we do not have a real opportunity to see how it operates.  An independent investigation might bring us that.  There is a great deal of money at stake.  The figures are astronomical so it is extremely important the State addresses this.  </p> <p> The Government should not put this off and kick the can down the road.  We need an independent inquiry established right now.  How it would be structured is an argument for another day.  The Government will probably have to bring in some people from outside the country.  I refer to many of the more senior players in the services the Government might use.  There is such an incestuous nature to much of what goes on this country that the Government will probably have to bring in some external expertise.</p></speech>

It is as if we are in the middle of a production of "Hamlet" when the boys are outside talking about their being something very rotten in the state of Denmark.  We all know what happened at the end play - there was no more Hamlet and the dynasty he stood over dissolved as well.  I honestly believe we on the cusp of something similar here.  Deputy Mulherin was correct in saying that NAMA has made an absolute hames out of its obligations in terms of the supposed goal that it would play a role in assisting in providing housing and so on.  That is only one side of the equation because, ultimately, it is this Government and other Government policies that have contributed to this situation.</p>  <p>  The Dublin City Council housing manager had to take to the media outlets to highlight the fact that his budget for this city will be &euro;18 million short to deal with the homeless crisis.  Even today three people contacted my office.  These are people living in hotels or hostels with serious mental health and physical health problems.  People are being told to source accommodation themselves.  If they find hotel or hostel which will take them, they are told to telephone a number and that the person at the end of that line will activate a credit card to pay for that accommodation.  When people do that, they do not get an answer to the number they telephone to activate the credit card and then the hotel accommodation is often gone.  The idea that we are expending millions of euro on this type of accommodation for families is appalling.  It is appalling wrong way round economics when we have so many units supposedly in the ownership of the State in NAMA.</p>  <p>  Instead NAMA is being used to off-load large quantities of property in big chunks which, as Deputy Wallace and others have said, has resulted in a distortion of the rental market, contributing on that side to other housing pressures.  A number of residents in my area have sought to approach NAMA as a co-operative of residents.  They would be middle income earners who would be refused large mortgages for the types of prices being charged for properties but if they collectively approached NAMA for some of the units, the Sate would get more money than it is getting from some of these big vulture funds and people would be accommodated.  These are extremely important issues.  We are talking about billions of euros of taxpayers money potentially being wasted, ending up in the private gain of individuals.  </p>  <p>  The idea that the Government would say it is okay, there is a very transparent process there, we have a Comptroller and Auditor General and that this body is open to scrutiny is laughable because it was not open to scrutiny when those in government were on the Opposition benches.  The amount of information that is now in the public domain makes it abundantly clear that given the huge interest this project is to the Irish taxpayer, and in terms of our housing strategy as we move forward, nothing short of an independent investigation is needed, involving external forensic accountants and financial people who can track down the money and find out what is going on.  Something of a side show has been conducted over the past few days.</p><p>I mean no disrespect to any politician but the idea that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the wherewithal to carry out this function is laughable.  I wonder if this idea is being pushed as a sort of side show to divert attention from what is actually necessary, which is a real inquiry.  This issue is far too important for people to try to grab a cheap headline or get themselves heard at a committee.  I am sorry, but that expertise does not exist.  We need something bigger.  We need someone from outside our society to come in and analyse this.  Given the huge property portfolios, American interests and so on, whose attention is now on this issue, that will happen sooner rather than later, but it would be far better that it would operate in the short term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-07a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700041#OO00200"><p>On foot of the amendment proposed by Deputy Mulherin, I want to add my voice to those of other Members in placing on the record our trepidation with regard to the workings of NAMA since its inception.  There is no doubt that the setting up of NAMA was not without its own controversies.  There were many fears on the part of the then Opposition Members, who occupy Government benches now, as to the remit afforded to it.  In the first instance, it allowed banks breathing space to get their houses in order to start again in terms of the sort of banking practices that were to be the norm from that time onwards, and more akin to what we had expected to be the norm in the first instance, despite the fact that those charged with the responsibility for their regulation assured us of that.  However, we see where that has got us, together with everything else that came in 2008 and 2009.  NAMA was charged with a responsibility to yield a dividend to the taxpayer.  It was given certain powers and briefs, and distance from Government to allow it do that properly and effectively, but it also had to play its role in yielding a dividend from a social perspective and particularly because of the loans that were associated with property that it could play its part in addressing the deficit that was allowed develop regarding the provision of housing.</p>  <p>  Year on year since the Government came into office we questioned it on the delivery of housing units to those on that list.  As we know, there are 100,000 applications for housing.  That does not mean there are 100,000 applicants; it might mean there are up to 300,000 applicants.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, we hear about the dilemma faced by Dublin City County Council regarding the provisions it had made on foot of commitments made by the Government regarding the homelessness problem.  There are still approximately 1,000 children in emergency accommodation in Dublin.  There are still 2,200 on the waiting list in the county I represent, and that is replicated throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  It is only in recent months that the Government appears to have gotten to grips with this problem and come forward with suggestions, plans and mechanisms which it believes might address that deficit but to go back to the point I was making, year on year we were told there would be a dividend from NAMA for the State but year on year, that did not materialise because, as Deputy Wallace said, we were led to believe that many of these properties were not suitable for local authorities or their tenants.  There was no in-depth analysis done of the reason that might be the case and that has allowed us to express our fears that these units - multiples of them - were much more suitable for the profiteering that exists for those who come in and buy them in bulk.</p>  <p>  It is against that background, and some of the details that have come into the public domain in recent weeks, that the fears we had over the past number of years have been heightened to such an extent that one recognises and is almost forced to agree with the perception that it might take somebody of more eminence than is proposed to address, analyse and audit NAMA and allow the House to adjudicate thereafter on the effectiveness of this organisation and its ability to deliver a return to the State in the first instance, whether that be in the form of monetary profit or social dividend.  I would argue there has not been a social dividend to the extent one would have expected when NAMA was set up initially.  I see that in my constituency, and I hear others say they see it in their constituencies.  That is at a time when there is great difficulty in terms of this Government being able to address the housing crisis and the disastrous situation that has since arisen.</p>  <p>  I have stated on numerous occasions in debates in the House on the provision of housing, whether it be questions on legislation brought before the House or at other times, that up to 40% of the representations I receive are in the area of housing provision.  That is a failure on the part of all of us who were elected to work together to address the problems that arise for the constituents we represent.  I am at a loss to know how to explain to the many people who come into my constituency office how they will be housed.  Yesterday, I had a couple in with me from the town of Edenderry who are faced with eviction from the home they have been renting.  They travelled the town in the past week or two and there is no emergency accommodation available.  The stress, anxiety and exasperation in the eyes, and on the faces, of those people, who were with their children, was terrible to witness, and we are witnessing it all too often.</p>  <p>  The background music to all of that is what we heard today, during the week and, to be honest, what I have been hearing on an annual basis, is the failure of NAMA to yield a social dividend.  I accept what has been said about the Dublin GAA county board, the Spawell facility and so forth, which seems to make sense in terms of the provision of an amenity to suit its needs and the needs of those people who would benefit from it.  More importantly, however, is the area of addressing the housing needs and if it is proved that there has been a failure and neglect on the part of whomever to realise the reason people are in such terrible straits, then somebody has to be held accountable.  What person, body, office or Department that is remains to be seen but unless a clearer picture emerges this week in regard to the deliberations of the Committee of Public Accounts on one issue in particular but, more importantly, on many others that need to be teased out, then the commitment from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the D&aacute;il earlier will have fallen on deaf ears and he may then be forced, with his Government colleagues, to acquiesce to the request that has been made by many on this side of the House for a full independent inquiry by eminently qualified professionals who can get to the root of this problem.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace talked about a figure of up to &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million in regard to the Chicago situation.  That would house the 2,200 people needing housing in my county.  That would satisfy the person who was in my office yesterday and the 40% of constituents who have sought my assistance in the office I hold and the responsibility I have been given as a Member of the D&aacute;il in order to access the public services.</p>  <p>  When funds were available and revenue was forthcoming, we were told we were spending too much.  As was stated last week in another part of the building, whom do we say is not entitled to what is available?</p><p>The demand for a social dividend from NAMA to the State was made in good faith and with the best of intentions.  All we want is reciprocation by those who have been given that authority.  I have not seen that social dividend in the form of housing units and I would like to know why that is the case.  I want a better answer than that I have been given heretofore, namely, the qualification by NAMA, or the local authority, that the units do not suit the needs.  What suits the needs if many of these buildings do not?  I do not know.  I am at a loss to explain that.  </p> <p> As I said, I will reserve my judgment until we hear what is said at the committee next Thursday when those charged with oversight of taxpayers' spend question those who act on behalf of the taxpayer in relation to public funds and dividends that may be derived from their dealings.  Next week, the Government will have to be in a position to say categorically that there is nothing to be fearful of here; that there is no bomb waiting to explode and that this matter is being dealt with as it should be.  As I said, it might take a bit longer for explanations to be forthcoming that satisfy me and many others in relation to the failure to address the real problems that I see in my constituency in terms of the provision of housing.</p></speech>

I am not too sure what the benefit of that would be.  While there are many questions surrounding NAMA, it is a public body.  Based on what we are being told, it will be out of business soon.  The real issue is not that NAMA will be sitting on vacant land but that it has not delivered social housing.  At a time when there are thousands of vacant NAMA-owned houses across this State, hundreds of which are in locations where housing is needed, there are thousands of people on housing waiting lists.  NAMA is not releasing houses.  Any of the houses that have come on stream through NAMA are being made available on a medium-term to long-term lease basis.  I am not too sure about the sustainability of that in the long term.</p>  <p>  The key issue is that assets, which are under the control of a public body, are not being used to the benefit of local authorities and people on local authority waiting lists and in need of affordable housing.  It is frustrating that many loans have been sold off at a proportion of their original value.  People in areas where there are NAMA properties, who would like to purchase one or two of them, cannot do so.  It is an all or nothing situation, which does not assist in addressing the housing supply issue across the State, in particular at the lower end of the private market.  We should be trying to assist people at that level.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, will be aware that people whose income is above &euro;25,000 do not qualify for social housing.  If they have children or a number of dependants this increases to &euro;26,000 or &euro;27,000.  There is a huge group of people who are not eligible to purchase affordable housing and cannot afford housing on the open market.  As announced yesterday, house prices across the State outside of the cities, including in the midlands and Laois and Offaly, increased by 15% in the last year.  As house prices continue to increase so too does the issue of affordability.</p>  <p>  On the proposed levying of local authorities in respect of vacant sites, I believe this is counterproductive.  As far as I am aware there are not that many local authority vacant sites which are causing problems.  If there are any such sites they are, in the main, greenfield sites that are awaiting housing development.  In my time as a public representative, I have not received too many complaints about them.  Local authorities are anxious to develop sites.  In levying a local authority, we would be levying not somebody on another planet but Joe public by way of increased property and PAYE taxes.  A levy on local authorities would impact Joe public and not an anonymous body from outer space.  The local authority is the public.  The public will have to pay for any levy imposed.  </p>  <p>  There is no issue in regard to local authorities and to levy them would be to miss the target.  The target is the cohort of developers and speculators who bought land and are sitting on it while it increases in value.  That is the group we need to go after.  We need to focus on the people who are buying sites and sitting on them for long periods.  There are many such sites across different counties which are causing a problem.  </p>  <p>  Another point worth mentioning in regard to local authority vacant sites is that the public will pressurise local authorities to develop them.  Local councillors, in conjunction with local communities, will pressurise local authorities to address problems around vacant sites.  This morning I had to deal with a matter involving a vacant property which a local authority sought to purchase recently and on which there was a fire last week.  Had the local authority been able to purchase it that might not have happened.  The financial institution which owns the site does not have it registered in its name.  It is almost impossible to have this matter addressed under the derelict sites legislation.  The sites in respect of which problems are arising are those sites are owned by financial institutions.  They are playing a cute game.  Where issues arise in relation to sites owned by local authorities, one need only telephone the CEO of the council or the director of services and one will get a result.  That has been my experience.  If one does not get a result, councillors can hold the CEO and so on to account at the next council meeting and, under the new Act, they can hold the executive to account in regard to why an issue is not being resolved.</p>  <p>  The imposition of a levy on local authorities is a circular action in that it will be the taxpayer and ratepayer who will have to pay thereby taking from councils resources that are badly needed for other purposes.  What the local authorities need is resources to build social housing on sites that are suitable for same.  I know there is no silver bullet that can solve this issue straight away but, hopefully, address of this issue can be accelerated, which Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see.  While every new house is welcome the pace at which social housing provision is happening is not quick enough.  We would like to see greater development of sites and thus greater social housing provision.  That is what is needed.  In areas where there are problems with local authority sites, the public, with the help of local councillors, will apply pressure to have those problems addressed.  I do not see any major issue arising in that regard.  In terms of what is proposed, we are missing the target.  We need to target the speculators who bought vast amounts of land during the collapse of the property market.  </p>  <p>  We have to face the reality that it will shortly be wound up.  Many NAMA loans have been sold on and, as a result, there is a huge pot of money in NAMA.  The Minister and the Government should give serious consideration to the use of a portion of that money for the provision of social housing, thereby releasing the pressure on local authorities in terms of the 90,000 households currently awaiting housing.  I do not recall housing waiting list numbers ever being as high.</p></speech>
