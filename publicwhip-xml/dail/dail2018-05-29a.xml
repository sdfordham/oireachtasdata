In a clear and decisive manner, the people, through the referendum, have voted for change - for new laws which will end the cruel inflexibility of the eighth amendment.  The people have given the Oireachtas the mandate and the obligation to legislate for a new approach, one that trusts women and their doctors.</p>  <p>  Civic society was powerful in this referendum.  Led by women, the Together for Yes campaign ensured that the voices of women remained central to the debate and they provided an immense service to democracy.  The Oireachtas committee, made up of all parties in this House, deserves particular credit for its fact-based, impartial approach to the issue and the comprehensive nature of its evidence gathering and analysis.  It now comes back to the Oireachtas to respond promptly, proactively and positively to the decision of the people.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could outline the timescale for the introduction of the legislation and its passage through the Oireachtas.  Could he indicate whether the Government is agreeable to having Second and Committee Stages debated and dealt with before the summer recess, even if that means lengthening the period for which the House sits to facilitate that?</p><p>The Select Committee on Health can progress Committee Stage through the summer after the Second Stage debate because, after all, the essentials of the Bill were well known.  They were debated at length during the referendum campaign.  It was very transparent and no one can argue otherwise.</p> <p> In addition, many women will require this new legal framework urgently.  Some nine women a day travel to the United Kingdom and three a day take an abortion pill.  We also have the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities to deal with.  There is an urgency to this matter for women in crisis pregnancies.  We no longer want women travelling to the United Kingdom on those lonely, isolated journeys.  We no longer want women taking the abortion pill in isolation without medical supervision or care.  Have the Government and Taoiseach considered, in the context of the new legal framework that will emerge, allowing women in Northern Ireland to avail of the services that will be enabled in the Republic as a result of the passage of the legislation?  Has giving them access to our GP services and hospitals been considered?  We already have established links with the health services in Northern Ireland in respect of other areas.</p> <p> In terms of consultation with the medical profession, will the Taoiseach outline whether any discussions have taken place with representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and other groups on this issue recently?  Have any preparations been undertaken in advance to prepare for a new legal framework?  Did the Department of Health engage in any scenario planning in the context of the referendum to ensure that it can now progress the various strands and areas that require attention as a result of the people's decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900004#B00200"><p>The people have indeed spoken in what was a great act of democracy.  A very clear majority, more than two thirds of Irish people, voted to amend our Constitution, to remove the eighth amendment and to put a new clause into our Constitution;13 new words that enable us to legislate for abortion in Ireland so that it is legal, safe and, it is to be hoped, rare.  It was a resounding result and credit for this result should be given to many different people.  I would particularly like to mention the members of the Citizens' Assembly under the chairmanship of Ms Justice Laffoy.  They met weekend after weekend to study the issues and come up with proposals.  It is interesting that they voted for those proposals by almost the exact same margin as was the result of the referendum, so I do not think anyone can argue against the Citizens' Assembly's representative characteristics.</p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the all-party committee under the chairmanship of Senator Catherine Noone, the Members of this House and the other House who took part in this campaign on all sides, the civil society campaign led by Together for Yes and others, and especially those very brave women and men who told their individual stories.  By opening their hearts they caused others to open their minds.  That was the crucial thing that changed people's minds over the last number of years.  I agree that this change in our society did not just happen in the last few weeks.  Perhaps it happened quite some time ago and the result we had at the weekend was just a reflection of that.</p>  <p>  It is now our job, as a Government and an Oireachtas, to give effect to the people's decision.  That involves a few things.  It involves new law to repeal some existing legislation and bringing in new legislation to regulate for the termination of pregnancies in Ireland.  It also involves the development of clinical guidelines by GPs, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  It will also require the licensing and regulation of some medicines which will need to be done by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  There are three discrete pieces of work that have to be done.  One of them falls to us while the others fall to others.  </p>  <p>  Meetings on the clinical guidelines involving the Department of Health and the various colleges and bodies that represent doctors are happening today.  There had been initial discussions prior to the referendum but obviously nobody wanted to prejudge the result so detailed discussions really only begin now.  The HPRA will also start its work.  When it comes to legislation, it is the view of Government that we want to legislate as soon and as quickly as possible.  We also want to make sure that we do not rush the process either because there are people who do not accept the result of the weekend and who may challenge the referendum itself in the coming days and who may wish to challenge the legislation in the months and years ahead once we pass it.</p><p>It is important that we act with haste but not too much haste that we put through bad legislation.  I think everyone will agree with that sentiment.  The Minister for Health brought a memo to the Cabinet this morning.  The Cabinet authorised him to work with the Attorney General to begin the drafting of detailed legislation right away as a priority, with a view to having it in this House before the summer recess.  We are agreeable to the Deputy's suggestion that the D&aacute;il term be extended into the recess, if necessary, to allow this matter alone to be legislated for and get through Second Stage before we rise for the summer, thereby allowing the select committee to consider the legislation during the recess.</p></speech>

I welcome his commitment to longer sittings to get the legislation through.  I agree with him that the urgency of this issue for many women in our society means that we have an obligation and a mandate to ensure the passage of the legislation, the general scheme of which was published on 29 March last.  He might indicate whether there was any scenario planning.  I accept that people had to wait for a result, but surely some priority work on the legislation was undertaken on the basis of what was likely to happen.  I would like to make an important point to the Taoiseach.  I know a thing or two about the health service and stakeholders.  I accept that people have their jobs to do, but we need to make it clear to the stakeholders that they cannot second-guess the decision of the people.  Equally, they cannot add caveats to it on the licensing side or with regard to clinical guidelines.  The people's decision is very clear.  The Government has a role in making it clear to all and sundry that the decision of the people cannot be second-guessed in any shape or manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900005#C00300"><p>There were two scenarios - the referendum being carried or it not being carried.  If it had not been carried, obviously there would be no legislation at all.  Now that it has been carried, legislation can be introduced.  A lot of work was put into the general scheme that was published in March.  The planning at the time will make it much easier for the Department of Health and the Attorney General to produce the actual legislation.  The amount of work done and planning in the development of the general scheme means that it will be done in weeks, whereas ordinarily it would have taken months.  We can examine the position on women from Northern Ireland.  My initial impression is that it will be treated like a normal health service.  It is already the case that women who reside in Northern Ireland and women who are Irish citizens can travel to Ireland to avail of healthcare.  There are people on the Northern side of the Border whose GPs are south of the Border.  People from Northern Ireland already come to hospitals here for healthcare.  I imagine it will be treated as a normal part of the health service in the normal way.  We also need to work on the detail of that aspect.  I have mentioned that a number of things need to be done.  It is not just a question of legislating in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Clinical guidelines will also be needed.  It will be necessary to regulate and license the new medicines.  We are still anticipating that even with the best intentions, it will be the end of the year - 1 January 2019 - before we give full effect to the will of the people.  The legislation might be through in October or November, but it will be January before we will be able to give effect to the new regime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900005#C00400"><p>Saturday was a momentous day for the people of Ireland.  We voted overwhelmingly to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution.  We said in a strong and unified voice that we would no longer tolerate Irish women being treated as second-class citizens.  We said we trusted women to make the best decisions on their pregnancies and healthcare.  We demonstrated the instinctive compassion of the people.  We said loudly that we were no longer willing to stand over a system that made exiles of women in crisis.  The people led and the politicians followed.  By voting "Yes", the people showed us their vision of what they wanted their country to be - progressive, equal, fair and kind.  It is important to commend the Citizens' Assembly, as the Taoiseach has done.</p><p>I commend the Together for Yes group for the fantastic work it carried out and acknowledge those who have campaigned for 35 years to achieve this result.  I also acknowledge those in this House who spoke out on the issue of abortion when it was not easy to do so.</p> <p> The campaign is now over and the people have spoken.  Our attention as elected representatives now turns to the job of enacting legislation.  It is crucial that we get this done without delay and that we get it right.  I appreciate that there are complexities in meeting the three objectives of passing sound legislation, drafting and agreeing clinical guidelines and enacting medical regulations.  This work needs to all happen in tandem.  We have to remember that between now and the enactment of legislation, women in crisis will still face the same challenges they did before the referendum was passed.  In the interim, as we await the legislation, a positive and necessary step is the immediate repeal of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, the abortion information Act.  That would allow doctors to make referrals for women and to confer with doctors outside the jurisdiction about the care of women who will still be forced to travel for terminations.  Repeal of this Act would at least offer women some degree of support and confidence.  By working together constructively, we can pass the necessary legislation promptly.  I hope every Member of the Oireachtas will act constructively and will recognise the decision of the people.  The people have played their part and now it is up to us as legislators to play ours.  </p> <p> Given the timeframe the Taoiseach has outlined, will he commit to working with us to ensure the 1995 abortion information Act is repealed immediately?  In respect of citizens living in the North, can he make a commitment that Brexit will not disrupt access to the services in the way he has described?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900006#D00200"><p>The people's decision was loud and clear.  We in this Government and this House have heard what they had to say; we want a modern Constitution for a modern people, a Constitution that says we trust women and respect their decisions and choices when it comes to their own healthcare.  It is now our responsibility as a Government and Parliament to give effect to the will of the people.</p>  <p>  The legislation that has been proposed and that is now being prepared by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris - he was authorised by Cabinet today to prepare it as a priority - will repeal the 1995 abortion information Act.  It is our intention, all things going to plan with the best efforts and the best people working on it, to have that legislation on the floor of the House before the summer recess, so in six or seven weeks' time.  That legislation will repeal the abortion information Act, which is important because it will allow doctors to refer women to clinics in England and elsewhere, at least during the period while we set up the new arrangements for this State.  We are open to considering the possibility of repealing that legislation as a discrete move or as a first move, which I understand is the proposal the Deputy is making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900006#D00300"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900006#D00400"><p>That is something we will need to talk about on a cross-party basis.  We need to be honest and clear about this.  It would be the same people working on that legislation.  It would be the same Parliament and the same Oireachtas time that would be used up.  It would be the same health committee that would have to sit in session and the legislation would have to go to the Seanad as well.  The likely effect of it would be to delay the main piece of legislation.  This is the nature of these things.  If we do this in a piecemeal manner, the big piece giving effect to what the people actually said at the weekend is the bit that will be delayed.  I know there are numerous suggestions at the moment for piecemeal legislation.  The Deputy has proposed something on information and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, and others have proposed that too.  Senator Ivana Bacik has proposed discrete legislation on decriminalisation.  If we have three, four or five, or even one or two discrete, piecemeal bits of legislation going through these Houses, it will still be the exact same people working on them.</p><p>It will push back and delay the main legislation, which is the legislation which will give effect to what people said at the weekend.  We need to ensure we all agree that we are willing to accept that before going down that road.  It is a matter on which we are willing to talk to people on a cross-party basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900007#E00200"><p>I am not proposing this discrete move, as the Taoiseach described it, as being optimum.  The optimal situation is that we could move the legislation within a matter of weeks and give immediate effect to the will of the people.  We all accept, however, that is just not possible and, in any event, we have to be sure-footed in the drafting of the new legislation.</p>  <p>  The bottom line is that women and girls will still fall pregnant.  Some of those pregnancies will be in crisis circumstances, such as, for example, a diagnosis of a fatal foetal anomaly.  The fact is that those women and girls will still have to travel.  That situation will pertain until the law is changed which the Taoiseach envisages to be early next year.  We cannot leave women in the impossible situation that they leave by boat or plane with a telephone number in their pockets without their medical files.  That is an intolerable situation.  I am suggesting as a mitigation - it is nothing more than that &ndash; that we ensure, at a minimum, that women or girls who still have to make the journey can do so with the advice, the care and the assurance of their doctors with their medical files in a joined-up and caring way.  That is the least we could do.</p>  <p>  While I accept the decriminalisation issue is urgent, in the practical outworking of this for women, I think this is the priority legislation.  Will the Taoiseach keep an open mind on this matter?  It is a necessary move and I believe, if there is goodwill, we could clear the decks.  It is a simple matter of repeal.  It is straightforward enough technically.  When does the Taoiseach propose to talk to the Leaders of the Opposition on matters such as this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900007#E00300"><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will meet party spokespeople tomorrow to discuss this.  He only got the result of the referendum on Saturday and approval from Cabinet this morning.  He is acting quickly in this regard and will meet the spokespeople tomorrow to discuss a way forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's analysis is correct.  There will be a lacuna, a gap period, between the point at which the referendum is certified - it has not been certified yet - and the legislation is enacted and commenced.  During that period, the same problems that women in crisis pregnancies have faced for years and decades will continue.  I understand the good intentions behind the Deputy's proposal.  What we want to seek, however, is a cross-party approach.  Part of the reason this change happened is because we had a reasonably good cross-party approach to this issue.  Everyone supported the Citizens' Assembly and everyone was part of the all-party committee.  Almost the majority of Members voted to put this question to the people.  I would like that broad cross-party approach to continue.</p>  <p>  We are open to discussing having discrete legislation along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  If we go down that route, however, we need to do it with eyes open, understanding that it may delay the timeline for the substantive legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900007#E00400"><p>Too often the profession of politics has a bad name in this country.  The result of the referendum over the weekend, however, showed Irish politics and the Irish people at their best.  The credit lies with the thousands, mostly women, who campaigned long and hard for the result and those who told their stories bravely and often for the first time.  It lies with those in Together for Yes, again run by women, who, despite many efforts to throw them off course, showed courage in pursuing their campaign strategy and sticking to the core message of care, compassion and change.  Across Ireland on Friday, people voted overwhelmingly "Yes" for these reasons.  They said enough to the hypocrisy of the eighth amendment.</p><p>It is often said victory has many mothers and defeat is an orphan.  The activists who toiled for decades on what was a taboo subject deserve the immense credit they won on Saturday.  Walking through Dublin Castle and in count centres throughout the country I saw people from across the political divide hugging and embracing at the momentous earthquake that was happening around them.</p> <p> We are now tasked in this arena, as others said, with implementing the will of the people.  The Minister for Health said last night that the proposed legislation would be published - the Taoiseach has confirmed it &ndash; and I hope passed on Second Stage in this session in order that Committee Stage could be considered during what was normally the summer recess.  I welcome the setting out of that clear timetable by the Government an look forward to exchanges with all parties in order that we can, as speedily as possible, implement the will of the people.</p> <p> People want to know what comes next.  I think there is great appreciation of the work done by the Citizens' Assembly on this important and complicated issue.  The assembly and its predecessor, the Constitutional Convention, have proved beyond doubt their worth.  That model should be used again to look at issues of complexity and importance for the country and its people.  The future patronage and control of the education system is one such issue.  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector during the term of the last Government was an important step but few schools have since been divested.  The most recent controversy over enrolment in Educate Together schools shows the demand for non-denominational education.  Will the Government, acknowledging the important role in dealing with this difficult issue performed by the Citizens' Assembly, convene a new citizens' assembly to address the issue of school patronage in order that we can have a comprehensive and open discussion involving all interests on an issue of major importance to the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900008#F00200"><p>I join Deputy Brendan Howlin in recognising the success the experiments of the Constitutional Convention and the Citizens' Assembly have been.  When we served in government together, the convention was included in the programme for Government agreed to in 2011.  None of us really knew how it would work out, but we can now stand over the fact that the assemblies were representative of the public.  Moreover, they gave issues real and detailed consideration and thus allowed us to move on in many ways.  They have been very helpful to the political system in helping us to understand what the opinion of the public would be once fully informed of all the issues.  The Constitutional Convention helped to give rise to the referendum on marriage equality three years ago.  The Citizens' Assembly gave rise not only to the referendum on the eighth amendment but also to the general scheme of the Bill that we published before the referendum.</p>  <p>  The Constitutional Convention looked at other things, including ageing and the issue of climate change.  One of the issues we have discussed in government is potentially asking a new citizens' assembly to look at the wider issues of gender equality.  We know, for example, that much good work has been done on issues such as domestic violence, as evident from the domestic violence legislation going through the Houses.  There is work to be done on other issues, for example, the gender pay gap, greater equality in pensions and having far higher participation of women on company boards.  For the first time, some 52% of the people appointed to state boards last year were women, but when we look across the corporate sector, we see it is not replicated.  Fewer than 20% of the members of boards of listed corporations are women.  One of the things we are considering is the next question we will put to the Citizens' Assembly.  The question will look at the wider picture of equality between men and women and ask the assembly to come up with a set of proposals to allow us to follow through in many ways on the result of the referendum and deliver equality between men and women in other areas.</p></speech>

Originally it was former Deputy Eamon Gilmore's idea.  Even within the Labour Party, he had some convincing to do on the idea that another forum would have merit.</p><p>However, the model has proven its worth.  One of its values is that it depoliticises an issue for a while.  In other words, when something is introduced here, no matter by whom, Members take an immediate position without exhaustively teasing out all sides and complexities of the issue.  There is a role for the Citizens' Assembly on the school patronage issue which is significant for many right now who want choice in the education they provide for their children.  The Citizens' Assembly model would be a very good way to have that debate and to allow all sides to have an input and be tested in an open way.  Will the Taoiseach consider adding school patronage to the list of issues of urgent issues to which he has referred, including the gender pay gap and gender issues generally, for consideration by a new Citizens' Assembly?</p></speech>

The Citizens' Assembly and the Constitutional Convention before it looked at many issues.  As such, it is not the case that an assembly could not look at more than one issue in future.  It is certainly something the Minister for Education and Skills and I will consider, along with the Government.  The Constitutional Convention made other recommendations, including lowering the age at which a person could become President, which the people decided to reject.  We should not necessarily assume that everything these assemblies or conventions come up with will be approved by the people.  Following through on a Citizens' Assembly's proposal, we will have a referendum next year on extending the right to vote in presidential elections to all Irish citizens, including those living in the North and across the world.  We want to have a referendum on that at probably the same time as next year's local and European elections.</p>  <p>  The Government has a policy on school patronage.  We believe in diversity and choice in education and educational patronage.  My view is that diversity should include the Catholic Church and other churches and religions whereas some would argue for a purely secular education system.  There is room in our education system for different forms of patronage, including the Church of Ireland, the Catholic Church, other religions, Educate Together and, of course, Gaelscoileanna.  I am not entirely convinced we should move from a model of diversity to one in which everything is exactly the same.  That is something that could be considered.  We have committed already to an additional 400 multidenominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  We also have a system now to survey parents on the patronage of new schools.  In my own area, people in Tyrrelstown decided they wanted a Catholic secondary school whereas in another part of the constituency, they decided they wanted an Educate Together.  That might not be a bad model either.</p></speech>

They want to stay in the places they were born and reared.  All these people would provide a site for a demountable home.  Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae said at last Monday's meeting of Kerry County Council that these people will only leave their home places in a hearse.  That is a fact.  These units have always provided comfort, a bit of heat, security, and safety from the elements and vermin and they still can.  As to rural cottages, only three have been built in Kerry in the last nine years.  From 2016 to 2021, ten are to be built.  However, there are 35 to 40 more people on the waiting list for these rural cottages.  These people will provide a site of their own.  They want to live near their parents and their family and to work on their farms but the Department has agreed to fund only ten of these up to 2021.  Do we have any funding for housing?  If the Government does not, I ask the Taoiseach to spell that out.  We would all understand.</p><p>Clearly, these people are providing almost half the cost of housing themselves.  They are providing the site.  In 2015, the Government announced &euro;62.5 million for housing in Kerry.  It never told us by when it would be spent.  Will it last until 2030?</p> <p> Rural cottages have been an integral part of rural Ireland since the foundation of the State, but in particular since the 1960s.  Is this aligned with the famous Project Ireland 2040 where planning permission will only be granted in rural areas if the development does not detract from the greater urban areas?  For instance, Kerry County Council granted permission to a person to build a house on his own place, being a favoured nephew, and it was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by one of these serial objectors.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la came back and said that, at 6 km, where he was proposing to build his house was too far away to go to his place of work.  That is a fact.</p> <p> These rural cottages almost always end up costing tenants, as they have almost always bought them because they are on their own land and they do not like to see anyone else coming into their own land.  It is only a loan, as the houses have been built to standard, and when the tenants have got on their feet, they have bought them out.</p> <p> Is the Government trying to move all the people into Dublin or into the urban areas?  That is what I am asking.</p></speech>

The Deputy might elaborate on demountable homes.  It is not a term I am familiar with, but perhaps one with which I should be.</p>  <p>  In terms of the broader picture, across Ireland 18,000 homes have commenced construction in the past year.  That is a significant increase.  We had a period of seven years during which almost no new homes were built in Ireland because the Government could not afford to build social housing and because the banks and construction sector were on the floor.  We are very much playing catch-up.  We have much to catch up on, but with 18,000 new homes having commenced construction in the past year, we are now building more new homes in Ireland than at any point in seven years.  We need to ramp that up to 25,000 next year and 35,000 the following year.</p>  <p>  Last year, we added 7,000 new homes to our social housing stock through different mechanisms, including direct build, approved housing bodies, leases and voids, and we will add almost another 8,000 this year.  We are ramping that up again and increasing the supply of social housing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned funding.  Specifically, &euro;6 billion is being provided for investment in housing between now and 2021.  That is an enormous investment in housing between now and 2021.  It will deliver 110,000 extra social housing units for people to live in between now and 2021.  That is a huge uplift in investment.</p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, under Project Ireland 2040 we have set out a plan for the nation.  It is a plan for a country with 1 million more people living here by 2040, with most of that growth happening outside of Dublin, the other cities growing twice as fast as Dublin and an extra 200,000 people living in rural Ireland.  Indeed tomorrow, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, will announce further details of the &euro;1 billion rural regeneration fund which will be deployed over the next decade.</p></speech>

At last Monday's meeting, Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae got a reply that the local authority must clearly demonstrate that the proposed demountable unit is required on foot of a genuine emergency - either a fire or a flood.  I must point out to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that there are many people who reach the age of 60, or maybe even older, whose house has fallen into disrepair.  They will not leave the place where they were born and reared.  All they are asking for is a demountable home to placed on a site, and even connected to their own septic tank.  It is very clear.  I am asking the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to examine this.  It is not fair to deny these people who want the right to stay where they were born and reared.  It is likewise in the case of the rural cottages.</p><p>To think that 35 applicants have to wait five more years to be housed, if they will be at all, in the rural place where they want to live on their farms and close to their parents.  The Government wants to move them all into the large urban areas.  I cannot understand why.  These people have their own water and septic tanks and they are burdening no one but the Government cannot see as far as its nose.</p></speech>

I am told it is an option for local authorities.  Ultimately it is for local authorities to come forward with those proposals.  A sum of &euro;6 billion is allocated in Project Ireland 2040 for investment in social housing over the next ten years.  Investment in social housing is ramping up dramatically.  To give the Deputy a rough idea of the figures, there were 657 direct builds.  That increased to 2,434 last year.  There were 1,250 acquisitions last year.  There were 600 leases last year with more ambitious targets again for this year.  There is a lot of money being invested in social housing, with &euro;6 billion set aside for the next ten years.  It is up to local authorities to come forward with proposals to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  If Kerry County Council wants to come forward with proposals for demountable homes or prefabricated dwellings, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his Department will certainly consider them.</p></speech>

There are still numerous complaints about delays in trial hearings and in criminal cases.  The Council of Europe has raised concerns about delays in criminal cases in Ireland, and there seems to be a consistent delay in tackling this issue.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government proposing legislation to reduce excessive delays to trials and court proceedings, including pre-trial hearings.  Revised heads of Bill were approved in June of 2015 and pre-legislative scrutiny of it has been completed.  Will the Taoiseach confirm when the criminal procedure Bill will be passed through this House?</p></speech>

More than three weeks after requesting access to the medical records and despite public and private assurances to the contrary, some patients have still to receive those records.  That is despite it being made clear to CervicalCheck that these are required urgently.  Some of the records in question were ready for release on 14 May last.  That was confirmed by CervicalCheck, yet more than two weeks later, they have not been released because they have not been signed off on by Mr. Damien McCallion.  In addition, a small number of records that have been released have been altered and omit a number of important documents.  This is unacceptable and flies in the face of assurances given by the Taoiseach and his Ministers that this would be handled with openness and transparency.  Will the Taoiseach act on this with the utmost urgency and ensure every patient and their legal representatives are provided with these full and complete records without delay?</p></speech>

I know CervicalCheck is under a lot of pressure trying to do lots of different things at the moment, as people can understand.  Additional staffing is going into CervicalCheck and it is very much my wish, that of the Minister for Health and, I believe, everyone in this House that records, old smears and anything that needs to be handed over should be done without any further delay.</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform promised this would be before the House in this session.  Extending the retirement age voluntarily would give comfort to many people who are now reaching retirement age and are not quite clear how this matter is to be resolved.  A circular was issued, No. 21/2017, that extends retirement age to 66 for civil servants but there are no such circulars in regard to other public servants or people like judges, although in my direct discussions with the Minister, I believe that is his intention.  When will we see the legislation, and in the interim, pending the enactment of the legislation, will very clear guidelines be given so that people will not be anxious that they will be forced out of employment and that they will be allowed stay on?</p></speech>

Time is of the essence.  Is the legislation already written and prepared?  People expected that it would be and that we would do all that is possible to get the legislation passed by the end of the summer.</p>  <p>  There are two issues I want the Minister to consider before he publishes the legislation.  One is that a message must be sent to women that they will not be penalised or criminalised, for example, the five women who will try to take abortion pills today.  An instruction needs to be sent to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, not to intercept those pills.  They are prescribed by a doctor, which is the justification given by the HPRA.</p>  <p>  The second issue is the suggestion that women would potentially have to attend a GP twice and pay &euro;300 to access an abortion.  I hope that these are wild rumours.  This should be no different to any other medical situation where one visit for a consultation and a prescription is all that is required.  Having to pay &euro;300 for this procedure will be extremely prohibitive for working women and lower paid women who do not have medical cards.  If that was to be the case the women may as well resort to the tele-medicine websites that can provide the service for &euro;90.  This would not be in line with what we want to do, which is to regulate and provide the procedure within our own health service.  I ask the Minister to dispel the notion of any barriers being put in the way of women with regard to the so-called 72 hour paternalistic "cooling-off period".</p></speech>

There has been a lot of preparatory work done around that general scheme to allow us to draft the legislation quickly.  There is not a draft Bill ready yet but a lot of work has been done on the general scheme to allow us to legislate and prepare the legislation quite quickly.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, will meet with the spokespeople tomorrow and will go through some of those other issues.  I expect that it will be treated as a normal healthcare service and will fall within the same rules of the General Medical Services Scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to importing medicines online, abortion pills or any other pills, it is not lawful to import prescription medicines online.  This is for very good reasons around patient safety.</p></speech>

I put it to the Taoiseach that the reality in the constituency of Cork South-West is that people are waiting years for cataract operations.  These are the official figures.  In sheer frustration and concern for our elderly who were going blind, and in some cases have gone blind, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I organised a bus to Kingsbridge Private Hospital for cataract surgery under the cross-Border directive.  We thought we would shame the Government into action but we were wrong.  I have called for an operating theatre to be opened in Munster in hospitals of excellence like Bantry or Mallow to carry out these simple procedures, which would prevent these elderly people having to travel to Belfast.  On Sunday, 10 June bus No. 10 will travel to Belfast from west Cork and Kerry.  I formally invite the Taoiseach, or any representative he wishes to send, to travel with us on bus No. 10 to see first hand what these people endure to get their cataract surgery outside the State.</p></speech>

This is a very impressive feat and well done to them on that.</p>  <p>  People can avail of the cataract procedures under the EU directive.  People are free to travel to any jurisdiction to avail of that healthcare or they can go to private hospitals within the State.  This is covered under the EU healthcare directive.  The waiting lists for cataract operations are improving and are getting better.  There is a lot of emphasis being put by the HSE on upping the amount of procedures that can be carried out each year.  This will continue.</p></speech>

The rules have been put forward to the Parliament and are proposed to be obligatory.  They mirror exactly the provisions contained in our Waste Reduction Bill 2017.  Last week the committee voted to put that Bill through to Committee Stage.</p><p>It is clear that no cost would be incurred by the Exchequer in implementing the provisions, yet the requirement for a money message has still been attached to it.  Will the Government allow it to proceed to Committee Stage in order that we might debate how it will be implemented and listen to what the European Commission states needs to be done in what it yesterday described as a race to the top?  According to it, there is urgency attached to states doing this work.  We have the legislation and carried out the analysis.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it has done it yet, but if it determines that it has Exchequer implications, it will have to seek a money message.  I am not sure if that has been done and will have to check.</p>  <p>  Like the Government, I welcome the proposals from the European Commission that were published yesterday.  They are very much in line with our own thinking and what we want to do as a Government in the next couple of years to reduce the amount of plastic waste and make sure more plastic is recycled.  It makes sense, because of the Single Market, that we do this on a Europe-wide basis and not have different laws in different countries at different times.</p></speech>

He said we would leave that issue for another day.  This is another day.  In fact, notwithstanding suggestions about the Citizens' Assembly examining these matters, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 will be before the D&aacute;il today.  Amendments to it seek the deletion in full, not in part, of the baptism barrier that allows for discrimination in school entry on religious grounds.  Other amendments seek to ensure religious instruction is given after school hours in order that people of no faith or minority faiths will be not subjected to moral or religious indoctrination that is not of their choice.  The referendum's exit poll tells us what the key issue for 62% of people was, namely, choice.  There has been much debate on the motive - choice was the motive.  People do not wish to be told what to do with their lives, futures and kids.</p></speech>

However, that does not mean that an admissions policy should exclude someone unfairly from access to his or her local school.  Our proposal is balanced, respects the desire for diversity and meets parents' needs.  We must also respect those who choose a religious education for their children.

In the Roscommon-Longford area in 2017, there were 339 robberies.  In Sligo-Leitrim, there were 247.  I know the Minister for Justice and Equality is gone.  It is clear that the policing model being pushed by this Government is not working.  I ask the Government to review it, including the closure of Garda stations.  The issue needs to be addressed.

They are best placed to know what type of policing works in the different communities throughout the country.  I point out that, over the past couple of years, we have made considerable progress in increasing the size of our force of garda&iacute;.  We will meet our target of increasing the number of garda&iacute; in the country to 15,000 and the wider force involving civilians and the reserve to 21,000.  Since Templemore was reopened to new recruits, 1,400 new garda&iacute; have attested, so we are seeing a substantial increase in the number of garda&iacute; available to police our communities.</p></speech>

Last week, I spoke to a lady who was waiting for almost a month to get a report on an MRI scan before it could be sent to her specialist.  The MRI scan was done in the same hospital.  It only had to go 100 m up the corridor, yet it took a month to do this because there are not enough radiologists to read and report the scans.  The key issue here is that when someone goes on holidays, when somebody is sick or there is a problem of some sort, staffing vanishes and the service vanishes with it.  There needs to be a huge emphasis on providing for cover in those situations and ensuring that they are properly resourced.</p></speech>

In December 2015, the Government announced its intention to set up a special committee to investigate defective concrete blocks in Donegal with a report date of May 2016.  It is now two years after that and the more than 5,000 homeowners who have defective homes as a result of defective blocks still have no clarity or commitment from the Government about putting a redress scheme in place to help them to fix their homes.  It is scandalous that the Minister has sat on this and tried to delay in the way that has happened so far.  He has, in effect, continued to kick the can down the road.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland report was due to be published by April.  We are still waiting for that.  Will the Minister tell the D&aacute;il when that will be published and will he also tell us when a redress scheme will be put in place so that those homeowners who are living a nightmare will finally get some relief and some assistance from the Government to get their lives back on track?</p></speech>

He has been to visit some of the homes to see the situation at first hand.

That is democracy in action.  It did give rise, however, to a number of issues around campaigning, and not just online campaigning which we talked about previously: the plethora of posters and whether there should be limits; the broadcasting ban on TV and radio, the fact that political advertisements are not permitted, and whether that is relevant in the modern age; and the fact that spending caps do not exist in referendums, which they do in elections.  All of those questions would be best tackled by an electoral commission, which is in the programme for Government 2016 and was in the Fine Gael manifesto in 2011.  Seven years on, however, we do not have one.  Where does that sit and will it commence shortly?  It would be very useful to tackle many of the issues that are emerging.</p></speech>

A constituent of mine who is a nurse has chronic back pain from complications with scoliosis and she has been on a hospital waiting list for surgery for more than 12 months.  On two occasions the surgery was scheduled at Tallaght Hospital and on both occasions the surgery was cancelled.  The woman in question was escorted to the theatre only to be told that the operation would not go ahead and that she must go home and await a further appointment.  The reason given for the cancellation is that there was no high dependency bed.  Her surgeon told her that would continue to happen until something is done to address the problem.  After seven years in government what plans does the Taoiseach have to ensure that this practice stops and patients do not have their operations cancelled continually, something which has a devastating mental and physical effect on patients?</p></speech>

After years of failed policies of reducing the number of hospital beds, we are going to increase the number of hospital beds in the health service so there is an adequate number of beds.  That is why we fully funded the bed capacity review to provide 2,500 more acute hospital beds.  Second, we are going to build three elective-only hospitals - one in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork.  Those two measures together will help reduce cancellations significantly.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Ring, will be aware of it.  Areas between Westport and Louisburgh get their water from the mountain and have to filter it with very expensive filtration systems.  Plans were in place ten years ago to pipe water from Westport to Louisburgh and to service everything in between.  It has come to my attention that it is not in the current capital plan of Irish Water nor is it in its medium to long-term plan.  I urge the Taoiseach to address that issue in order that the scheme is included in the medium-term plan of the next capital plan.  It is astounding to be talking in 2018 about safe, clean drinking water.  Somebody was hospitalised in the past month due to the problem.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an chumhacht agus an tionchar cu&iacute; aige chun seasamh suas don Ghaeilge n&aacute; do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh anois go mbeidh an Rialtas s&aacute;sta tiomp&uacute; ar an rud seo agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo.  Rud simpl&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist.

It was made by 1,429,981 people who came out with hope in their hearts to vote for compassion in our Constitution.  As a country we said to Irish women, we trust you and we respect your choices about your healthcare.  More people voted on Friday to remove the eighth amendment than the combined number of people who voted on both sides in 1983.  It was, therefore, a resounding act of democracy.  Thirty-five years ago, the 1983 referendum was described on the front pages of the newspapers as having split our country into two nations - urban versus rural, Dublin, which voted against the amendment, against the rest of the country.  Today we are not a divided country.  We do not have red states and blue states.  Men and women from all regions and all social classes, rural Ireland and urban Ireland and almost all age groups voted yes.</p>  <p>  In this Oireachtas and beyond, there are women and men from all political parties and none who campaigned and led on this issue for many years.  Some campaigned for decades and opposed the eighth amendment before it was inserted into our Constitution, showing great courage when it was easier to comply.  We owe a debt of gratitude to these people.  We also owe a debt to the hundreds and thousands of people who went out canvassing, often for the first time, to try to open hearts and change minds.  I hope they will remember that their movement was watched by the entire world and that they will remain engaged in politics because there is much, much more to do.  There is always more to do.</p>  <p>  Most of all, we owe a debt of gratitude to those who shared their personal stories in recent weeks and months, women and men who opened their hearts and so enabled others to open their minds.  We were moved by their searing experiences and we were determined to ensure that their stories were not shared in vain.  Saturday's result shows that we heard what they had to say loud and clear.  The days of cold, hard judgment, which cast a long shadow in this country, are banished to the past.  To younger women and men we said, this is your country and one you can be proud of.</p>  <p>  Ireland's past is a foreign country; we did things differently there.  Now let us look to the future.  In advance of the referendum, the Government published the general scheme of the Bill so that people would know what they were voting for.  This morning the Minister for Health received approval from Cabinet to start drafting this legislation formally and as a priority.  However, it is not just about legislation and new laws.  There are a number of other items that we also need, including the development of clinical guidelines for doctors written by the medical colleges and institutions, and also the regulation and licensing of certain medicines.  All things going to plan, we will proceed with the drafting of the new laws required and bring the legislation into the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  Our speed will be tempered only by our determination to get this right, to ensure a safe service for women and ensure there are no flaws in the legislation that would open it up to legal challenge and delay.  We are confident we can complete all this work before the end of the year and we look forward to working with Deputies and Senators from all sides to ensure we get this right.</p>  <p>  We also restate our promise that we want to do more to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions further.  We want more sex education and wider availability of contraception and emergency contraception.  Abortion rates are already falling and teenage pregnancies are at their lowest since the 1960s because of them.  The Government will continue to improve access to sexual health and education to reduce crisis pregnancies and abortions further in the year ahead, so that they become rare.</p><p> We want to continue to make Ireland a better place in which to raise a family.  We have started on this, with two years of free preschool now guaranteed to every child, free GP visits for young children, subsidised child care, paid paternity leave, as well as increases in the working family payment and home carer's tax credit for two years in a row.  We will do more because we want Ireland to be one of the best places in the world in which to raise a family - families in their many forms.</p> <p> All weekend I found myself reflecting on the referendum result and what the scale of the victory meant.  It demonstrates that politics can bring about change and that democracy does work.  On Saturday I quoted one of my favourite poets, Maya Angelou, because her whole life reminds us of how one can transform the agony of one's life experiences into a beautiful call for equality before the law, tolerance and respect.  Saturday's result was such a call.  It is a call which has resounded around the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900021#T00200"><p>The outcome of the referendum has been as clear and decisive as it could possibly have been.  There is no doubt about what we must do.  With an overwhelming majority, the people have given the Oireachtas the right and the duty to legislate quickly for a new approach, founded on the core principle of trusting women and their doctors.</p>  <p>  It is an historic change but not one which came about easily.  It is a revolutionary moment fundamentally based on the tireless, passionate and loud advocacy of active citizens.  This change could not have come about without the incredible bravery and dignity of women who came forward, both publicly and on a more personal level, to tell their stories about the cruel inflexibility of a system which had both judged them and denied them care.  I personally thank the women and men in many settings and all parts of the country who spoke to me about their experience of life under the eighth amendment.  From all ages and backgrounds, they were driven by a determination that what had happened to them should not be allowed to keep happening to others.</p>  <p>  The best part of the campaign was how the cause for change was led by the largest and most diverse civil society campaign ever assembled in the country.  Led by women and committed to keeping the voices of women central to the debate, the Together for Yes campaign, as well as the umbrella organisations which operated before the campaign, provided an immense service for our democracy.  I also acknowledge the tireless work of groups of doctors and nurses to ensure we had a fact-based debate capable of overcoming efforts to distort and manipulate public opinion.</p>  <p>  A key to the success of the referendum was a proposal which respected the evidence of what changes were required to address the clear failures of the eighth amendment.  The Citizens' Assembly had pointed in a general direction but proved that it was possible to ensure a well structured debate could allow people the space to question themselves and reach challenging conclusions.  It was the proposal of the joint Oireachtas committee which went before the people.  It showed just how much could be achieved when we worked together to try to find a consensus.  The chair of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone, carried out her role in an exemplary manner and was 100% correct in emphasising expertise over advocacy.  The tone of debate central to this being possible emerged from the debate on Deputy Clare Daly's Bill which directly began the process which led to the referendum.</p>  <p>  The proposal that there be a 12-week period was, for many, a risky decision.  However, there was no other way of dealing with the reality of how to end an inflexible and judgmental system.  It reflected both medical reality and the basic need to trust in the decisions of women.  The fact that the 12-weeks provision gained in support the more it was debated, as well as surviving an aggressive attempt to paint it as going too far, means that we now have real clarity on the principles the people wish to guide our legislation.  On a personal level, I acknowledge Deputies Billy Kelleher and Lisa Chambers and Senator Ned O'Sullivan who proposed the 12-weeks provision at the committee.  Given the urgency to end the current law, the clarity of both the result and the promised legislation, together with the all-party work which shaped the legislation, full and rapid enactment is our basic duty.  We will facilitate this in any way possible, including by having extra sittings.</p>  <p>  We also face a new challenge about how we discuss abortion in the new reality where the law is based on trust of women and medical professionals, rather than a constitutional prohibition.  There is no democratic country in the world where there is no ongoing debate about abortion.  Ireland will be no different.  People with strong conscientiously held beliefs must be able to speak.  Our democracy will be undermined if we deny their rights.  However, we must act to make sure the extreme tactics, seen particularly in America, have no place in Ireland.  Many of us have at different times been confronted by the extreme behaviour of a small minority.  They employ shock tactics and aggression to make their point.  This repelled parents during the campaign when they were forced to explain graphic images and extreme claims erected on posters outside hospitals, schools and many other places.  We must from the first moment protect women and medical professionals against the extreme radicalism seen elsewhere that tries to block the operation of democratically agreed policies.</p>  <p>  We also have to learn from the campaign to protect our democracy.  The Government's complacency about the abuse of online advertising was cruelly exposed.  The weakness of key elements of how we oversee referendums and elections is there for all to see.  We must act now and not wait until we see here the abuses unfortunately common in other countries.</p>  <p>  The people have had their say.  They looked at the evidence, engaged in a long debate and reached an absolutely clear decision.  They want change.  They want laws which end the inhuman inflexibility which was embodied in the eighth amendment.  They want us to trust the decisions of women and the medical professionals on whom they rely for care.  We have had a campaign dominated by the voices of women and stories which have challenged all of us to listen.  It is now up to us to act by rapidly and comprehensively implementing the people's decision.</p></speech>

Ireland is changing and the old certainties are being challenged.  A new and better Ireland is emerging.  Saturday was a day when those who had been silenced demanded to be heard.  It was a day when we collectively and decisively broke from the past.  It was a day when the people said this was our time and our Ireland.  It was a day when a substantial majority said in a loud voice that we were compassionate, that we trusted women and that we wanted doctors to act free from the threat of criminal sanction.</p>  <p>  I thank and congratulate the Together for Yes group on a magnificent campaign.  I also acknowledge the doctors and lawyers who provided their expertise and experience and were listened to.  I commend every activist from my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, and all others for their hard work across the State.  Above all else, the campaign was marked by the women who had come forward to share their personal stories about dealing with tragic circumstances.  In that regard, I acknowledge the group Terminations for Medical Reasons that was truly magnificent in its campaigning.</p>  <p>  As we progress to legislating for this decision made by the people, our thoughts still remain with all those who have suffered and died as a result of an amendment which should never have been in the Constitution.  I sound the name of Savita Halappanavar whom we remember in these times.  I express our solidarity with her family and every family which has suffered because of the eighth amendment.</p>  <p>  The campaign created a space for Ireland, North and South, to look at the experiences of women.  We are the better for it.  Their voices have been heard and can no longer be silenced by guilt or neglected by the Government.</p><p>Ireland is changing and this is evident in the vibrant "Yes" campaign headed by women and many young people.  I wish to thank them and mark their achievement.</p> <p> The need and the case for change to protect women and our lives is now unanswerable not only in this jurisdiction but throughout our island.  We need Irish law, Irish service provision and Irish regulation to keep our women safe.  It is unacceptable to those of us in the South that women and girls would buy abortion pills over the Internet and take them without medical supervision.  It is unacceptable to us that they may be fearful of seeking medical assistance should something go wrong due to the threat of criminal sanction.  It is equally unacceptable that any woman or girl in the North would be left in those situations.  It is completely unacceptable that any of these women or girls are criminalised or hauled before the courts.</p> <p> The referendum result tells us that Irish norms have changed, that the absolutist position on abortion as a black-and-white issue is gone and that people understand this now in all its complexity.  Even those who have a strong moral objection to abortion now understand that, in the complexity of life, women and their doctors have to be free to act, have to be afforded choice and have a right to choice.</p> <p> The imperative now is to act on the instruction of the people.  The result was overwhelmingly definitive, such that I have no doubt the message has been heard loud and clear by Government and all legislators.  The imperative comes from the fact that women must be protected.  Pregnancy, by definition, is time-sensitive.  Every week and every month we fail to enact the legislation, we put our women in the way of danger.  Consequently, we must act speedily.  We have a history of foot-dragging on the issue of abortion because it is considered sensitive and difficult - I acknowledge that it is.  However, if the referendum is to mean anything for legislators and the political system, it is that the days of delay are over and that the time for action is now.  Those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in recognise that imperative.  We maintain the Government cannot delay and must act to bring forward the legislation, and I understand the Government will do so.  We will work constructively and diligently with the Government on this matter.  We have no problem supporting special sittings during the summer months to ensure we get the legislation right and that we get it passed in a timely fashion.  Let us go forward together to ensure this is the first step in creating that new Ireland.  As this chapter in our journey to full equality closes, let us look forward to the next one with the same determination and solidarity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900022#U00200"><p>I said yesterday that for many people Saturday was a day of great excitement and that for some of us it was equally a day of relief.  Clearly, 35 years is a long time to wait to repeal a measure we opposed in the first place.  When I was in the Seanad in 1983 we came close to defeating the amendment.  I recognise that would not have stopped the referendum in 1983.  It would merely have delayed it but it might have afforded the time for reflection on what was being done.  I am mindful today of the strong clear reasoned arguments put forward then in the Seanad by Members, including Mary Robinson, Michael D. Higgins and Catherine McGuinness.  I am mindful of the courage of Dick Spring, Barry Desmond, Eileen Desmond and others in the D&aacute;il despite searing opposition from some.  Over the weekend I thought fondly of the late Monica Barnes, a champion of equality.  It is sad that she was not here to see a change she had worked so strongly to bring about for so many years.</p>  <p>  Lessons were learned from that rushed and politically damaging episode, when a small minority bullied the two largest parties into proposing an amendment that the then Taoiseach described as dangerous and that was opposed by the then Attorney General.  Those were truly desperate days.  The contrast with the process engaged in by this D&aacute;il could not be more marked.  A deliberative Citizens' Assembly, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, provided a platform and a calm atmosphere for all the issues to be fully addressed and for all arguments to be heard.  This was followed by the diligent work of the all-party committee ably chaired by Senator Catherine Noone.  The committee arrived at a set of proposals that attracted broad cross-party support.  We subsequently learned those proposals attracted the support of the people as well.</p>  <p>  Yet, the seeds of change were sown many years ago.  In 1992, the Supreme Court laid bare the contradictions inherent in the eighth amendment.  If the evidence of turning a blind eye to the issue of abortion was not obvious enough, the people formally enacted provisions in our Constitution in 1992 to facilitate information to be provided on abortion and for women to travel for abortion but not to have abortions here.  The issue was returned to in 2002 when a further effort was made to remove the grounds of suicide and reverse the Supreme Court decision.  That effort too was defeated by the people.</p>  <p>  Yet, it was the tragic death of Savita that radically changed things.  It showed the cowardice of our political system, which had failed to show the leadership that had been called for over many years.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was among the most difficult tranches of legislation enacted by the last Government.  It was pursued line by line and fought detail by detail.  It is not right to say Savita did not die in vain &ndash; she did.  She should not have died.  Nothing can change that.  Yet, people were so horrified by the reality created by the medical-legal environment of the eighth amendment and the tragic way it contributed to the untimely death of Savita that a grassroots movement was sparked throughout Ireland.  That led to the repeal.  It opened the doors for hundreds of women to tell their stories and shine a light on the pain that the eighth amendment had inflicted.  The result on Saturday shows how conclusively the people can make a decision on these matters.  I hope it finally draws a line under decades of struggle.</p>  <p>  Abortion will always remain a divisive issue but the scale of the vote - two thirds of the electorate voted "Yes" - has definitively changed the context of how terminations of pregnancy can and must be considered in Ireland.  What was once a taboo subject is now openly discussed.</p>  <p>  For 35 years we have denied something essential to Irish women.  We have denied them security and protection at crucial points in their lives.  We have denied them dignity too.  Saturday was a levelling day for them.  Our job now, as others have said, is to quickly implement the legislation and right this historical wrong.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that only for the strong pro-choice message that the Citizens' Assembly delivered politicians in here would not have gone as far as they were forced to go.  We should register who delivered the "Yes" given the gender-quake and youth-quake that took place on Friday.  Among female 18 to 24 year olds there was a 94% increase in voting compared to the 2016 general election.  There was an increase in women voting in every age and category but it was particularly evident among young people.  They persuaded others and other generations to fall in with a new message.</p>  <p>  I never doubted we could have this resounding message.  The battle was not winning the referendum; the battle was getting a referendum granted from the D&aacute;il over the past five years.  Once it got into the hands of ordinary people I had faith that we could persuade them why this change was necessary.  There is a danger that we could see a re-writing of history to the effect that politicians going on a journey delivered this change.  Actually, it derives from the grassroots movement that has built up, especially since the death of Savita.</p><p>It was not a quiet revolution, as the Taoiseach informed the world, it was a noisy and boisterous one.  People went on strike, marched and took civil disobedience actions in a relentless fashion to force the issue onto the political agenda.  The socialist left in the D&aacute;il was the only reflection of the movement taking place for a long time and until recently.  The Taoiseach has now appealed to people to stay involved, albeit it could be a dangerous message for him to give out.  I agree that people should stay mobilised until we win free contraception and proper and objective sex education.  The Solidarity Bill should now be progressed.  There are also other issues relating to the separation of church and State.</p> <p> What about the housing crisis?  I appeal to people to stay involved to tackle those issues and to continue to mobilise to call the Government out in the same way we did on repeal.  I will be going to the North on Thursday to support the abortion pill bus being organised by ROSA.  The next step is to legalise abortion in the North.</p></speech>

Since 1983, we have learned a great deal with the exposure of all of the scandals around the treatment of women and children in institutions like the Magdalen laundries and the Tuam mother and baby home.  However, we still have a great deal to learn about how we treat women's health.  We need to bring closure quickly to the questions of symphisiotomy and the cervical cancer scandal.  That line in the sand is gone for the old conservative religious dogma of this country and the tide is gushing in.</p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il needs to look seriously over the next period at the question of the separation of church and State.  Yesterday, I was contacted by a couple from Limerick who spoke to me after I tabled the &euro;1 Bill to decriminalise the abortion pill in 2016.  In 2016, they had just returned from Liverpool with their little baby girl in a box in the back of the car.  They were extraordinarily sad but wanted to thank all of the Deputies in the D&aacute;il who supported repeal.  Since 2016, they have had a baby who is now four months old.  They had decided they were not going to have any more children because they might be put through the trauma of being exiled from their own country.  They have now decided to try again.  To those who were telling us we were baby-killers, the impact of the eighth amendment on women's health has been lifted and people can see what are the real issues in maternity care.</p>  <p>  The key issue in this debate was choice.  Consistently, 62% of the people said women should be given a choice.  Now that they have a choice, they need to be able to choose, not only to control the number of children they have and the number of pregnancies they are able to terminate, but to be able to say they want a family.  For that, they need a home, education and health care.  The Government has failed miserably to provide tens of thousands of people with that choice.  It is a serious economic, social and political issue which we need to address together as a community which has fought and won this magnificent referendum in big numbers.  We need to get real choice for all women of all classes.</p></speech>

He said abortion had been an issue all his adult life and he could not believe it was over.  He said he never wanted to hear the word again.  I felt an enormous sympathy.  What he said summed up exactly the way I felt about it myself.  For so many, the weekend's vote was like an enormous weight being lifted.  A ball and chain that dogged us all our adult lives was finally gone.  I cannot believe that I am 50 years of age and it has taken this long.  It has taken my daughter to come home for her first vote to get us here.  For so many women, it represented so much.  It is almost like society atoning for everything it has done to women in this country; atoning for how we stigmatised women faced with crisis pregnancies, the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes, the shaming, the forced adoptions and the robbed identities about which we will hear later this afternoon.  It still goes on.</p>  <p>  The biggest sentiment behind the "Yes" vote and the question people asked most often was "Who am I to judge?".  They said it was not their decision.  So many people in our society have acknowledged that life is hard and that there are choices a lot of people have to make, including today, which they would really rather never having to make.  It is not easy to parent alone in this State.  It is not easy to raise a child or children with disabilities with the lack of support that is there.  It is not easy to find out one is pregnant to a violent man.  It is not easy, of course, to hear that one's much-wanted pregnancy has a fatal anomaly which is incompatible with life.  As a society, we were never going to be able to end that pain, but we could make sure we did not add to it.</p>  <p>  When Deputies Mick Wallace, Joan Collins and I introduced our legislation in 2012, only 20 Deputies voted with us.  At that time, four incredible women went on the "Late Late Show".  It was the first time people in this State openly identified themselves as having travelled for terminations.  They were Amanda, Arlette, Jenny and Ruth who later founded the group Terminations for Medical Reasons.  Is it not appalling that they and their colleagues had to lay bare their most appalling pain and tragedy in order to turn that into a social movement which changed history?  They should not have had to do that.  I am in awe of them and all of their colleagues who took part in the campaign.  When we assembled here and Deputy Wallace moved the legislation on fatal foetal abnormalities, those women were in the Gallery.  Afterwards, their hearts were broken that the House had voted against them again.  There were people who travelled that day and there is probably someone who is travelling today also.  We should not have compounded their pain but the fact that they stepped forward was huge.</p>  <p>  It was not the beginning of the campaign.  Some rewriting has taken place in that regard.  However, it was the beginning of the final phase.  We had the founding then of the abortion rights campaign and the first march for choice, which was the first openly pro-choice activity in the State.  It was only after the march that, sadly, Savita died and the move to repeal gained a greater urgency.  Many people came on board the repeal movement then and I am delighted they did.  However, we should remember the time before the glory days when it was the Well Woman Centre, the Irish Family Planning Association and the Abortion Support Network in the UK which took in our women and girls and paid for their fares.  If I had to name one person more than anyone else, it was Ailbhe Smyth, a giant of this movement who stood there when there was no glory to be had.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge genuinely the role the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, played albeit it took them a while to get there.  I have no doubt they were helped by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, at Cabinet and, definitely, by Deputy Kate O'Connell at the parliamentary party.  While I am not sure they would have got there as quickly without Deputies Zappone and O'Connell, they were at the helm and steered the ship and history will testify that they delivered.  I thank them for that.  Let us be honest however and point out that politicians have not led on this issue.  We have not even followed until recently.  This has been an uphill battle.  A boulder has been pushed up a hill for decades and no one here was behind it.  Let us be honest about it for once.  No one was involved.  In fact, a lot of people here were sitting on the boulder, making it even more difficult for those outside who wanted to push for change.  Others, of course, decided to jump ahead and claim some of the glory once the boulder was at the top of the hill and about to go down the other side, even though they had done none of the pushing.  I do not say that to score points, but to learn the lesson because there is going to be a next time.  Perhaps we can learn something next time around.  We need to move to enact the legislation.  Even today, however, I have heard people trying to out-posture each other as to who will be the most radical, claiming we should cancel all holidays between now and forever and bring in legislation tomorrow or even yesterday.  It is nonsense.  Can we please cop on with the games, which are despicable?</p>  <p>  My last point is for students and young people.  I am proud of the student movement.  I was one of those students years ago but we did not succeed in changing the world.  I hope this generation will.  The young people who mobilised and enfranchised their peers are the legends in this.  I hope they make a better job of changing the world than we did.</p></speech>

There was raw emotion in that contribution.</p>  <p>  The people have spoken in a strong, clear voice to repeal the eighth amendment.  It is quite obvious that the Irish people put substantial thought into their decision.  They put quiet, emotional thought into their decision.  It was unseen by the political elite and by the political pollsters that such an emphatic two to one majority would come to pass.  It was felt that it would be substantially less than that.</p>  <p>  The people voted across the divide.  They voted across the class divide, the creed divide, the age divide and the urban-rural divide.  This referendum has shown how far the Irish people have come in their thinking over the past 35 years.  To vote in a clear majority, two to one, was stunning.</p>  <p>  This process demonstrates the strength of our democracy but it also demonstrates that a referendum is the ultimate citizens' assembly, where people make their voices known and the Oireachtas must respond.  As Chairman of the Committee on Health, I have the particular responsibility of facilitating the examination of this legislation, through pre-legislative scrutiny but also through the Committee Stage.  I recognise the urgency with which this legislation needs to come to pass.  We must also recognise that it is a process that has to be examined carefully so that we get the legislation correct and that it stands up to any challenge that may subsequently be put to it.</p>  <p>  The central issue revolving around this legislation will be the provision of safe, effective and legally delivered termination of pregnancy.  I believe this will be a new service within the health service and there will be new responsibilities on the medical profession.  There will have to be clinical guidelines and ethical guidelines, which will be very important.  We must also approve new procedures and new medications.</p>  <p>  The majority of the termination of pregnancy will be delivered before 12 weeks.  That will be delivered within primary care, through a GP-led primary care service.  This will be unique in the world because I am not aware of any other jurisdiction which has a GP-led termination service.  We need to look at this carefully.  It may well be that these services will have to be provided in GP-led clinics and not just through GP-led standard practices because it is not simple a matter of writing a prescription.  There will be a number of consultations involved in this and there will be the necessity to have dating scanning because the medication which is prescribed will vary depending on the length of the pregnancy.  These are matters that must be dealt with through the medical organisations.  It may well be that GPs will opt in to this process rather than each GP in his or her own surgery providing the service.  There is a level of expertise which will be needed in regard to general practice and that has to be dealt with through the representative bodies.</p>  <p>  I would also like to refer to the fact that there will be conscientious objection to this.  If the medical profession is to be reflected in the vote, then one third of doctors will not want to participate in this process.  That goes for nurses and allied health professionals as well.  That has to be built into the legislation.</p>  <p>  We must dwell on the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and the prevention of crisis pregnancies.  The committee dealt comprehensively with introducing safe-sex education into our schools, so that crisis pregnancies are avoided, and to make available contraception.  Contraception should be made freely available.  I note that is the Minister's intention.</p>  <p>  The delivery of termination in the first 12 weeks should be done through a State system.  There should not be a cost attached to it.  We should not have a two-tier termination service.  We need to have a consistent service which is delivered through the public system that is safe and effective.</p></speech>

I did not think that shadow would last for 35 years but, thankfully, it has been removed by the citizens of this country.  I must say the overwhelming emotion is one of relief.</p>  <p>  It was an honest process and it was evidence based.  The Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee not only recommended repeal but outlined to the citizens what they might expect, and that has enhanced politics.  It was a resounding result and it behoves every legislator to respect the mandate and legislate according to what the citizens wish.</p>  <p>  Saturday's result is a vindication for those of us who have argued for 35 years that it was time for the citizens to have their voice.  It strengthened the process and I regret that there were Members in this House who wanted to deny people that opportunity.</p>  <p>  It is clear that Ireland has moved on and so must our systems.  The common call I heard in the wake of Saturday most of all was the need for school divestment to escalate.  We will see much more of that now.</p>  <p>  The other aspect that has become very obvious is the number of new people who have been mobilised and became active, particularly many young women.  It is all the better for our political system if they remain connected.  I particularly acknowledge the role of Together for Yes and acknowledge the point about Ms Ailbhe Smyth that Deputy Clare Daly has made.  I get a sense that this and the previous referendum on marriage equality have started to put us into a different place where we can finally start seeing a real republic emerging.  There is much work to be done on that, but school divestment and the likes of the National Maternity Hospital issue are two critical issues that we will see more of in the future.</p></speech>

Tens of thousands of people around the country campaigned, canvassed, told their stories and had difficult conversations with loved ones and they delivered a "Yes" vote.  The people of Ireland spoke with a clear voice that, no matter the difficulties or decisions facing our people, we will look after them in our own country.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Together for Yes campaign and thank everyone who campaigned and canvassed in their droves throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The dedication, energy and passion for change I saw in the members of the local Dublin-Rathdown Together for Yes group was inspiring.  I hope that everyone who became engaged and active in seeking a change through the course of that campaign and every activist who knocked on doors, delivered leaflets, stood at stalls on a Saturday afternoon, continues to fight for change and remains active in politics, and helps us all to fully realise the power of a nation engaged in a true democratic process.</p>  <p>  Every Irish woman who in the past was shamed and forced to travel abroad will hopefully have felt a sense of joy, or at least relief, on Saturday knowing that her sister, daughter or friend will not have to face a similar journey.  This campaign highlighted the need to put in place more supports for all women and mothers in Irish society.  By addressing the challenges in Ireland's housing, social welfare, education and economic systems which disproportionately affect young women, we can move towards a really pro-choice society where every prospective mother has real freedom in what she decides to do.  It is up to us in this House now to ensure that full effect is given to the will of the people as quickly and as clearly as possible and that we as a society take caring and compassionate responsibility for those women who for so long were left behind and driven away.</p></speech>

They organised the campaign in Tipperary brilliantly.  They brought commitment, courage, energy and enthusiasm to that campaign and as one who campaigned against and voted against the amendment in 1983, I welcome the resounding success.</p>  <p>  I would like to see the legislation enacted quickly, including sitting during the summer recess.</p><p>There are measures which could and should be taken immediately, and these include the amendment of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 to allow medical doctors to refer women abroad and to allow for the sharing of medical records and notes.  The 14 year prison sentence should be immediately abolished.  We know not the day nor the hour when another Savita case might arise.  The Oireachtas should amend the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 to provide for terminations on grounds of serious harm to the health of the woman.  These measures could be taken quickly and implemented within a few weeks.</p></speech>

The capacity review put a lower estimate of 2,590 beds which has been reflected in the capital plan.  The ESRI has figures, as do various other groups, that give a broad range of what might happen.  Given that there are numerous, very reputable organisations providing us with a wide range of the number of new acute beds we may need, will the Minister take that into consideration and perhaps review the capital plan with this additional analysis in mind?</p></reply>

As the Deputy knows, the Government committed to undertaking a health service capacity review in A Programme for a Partnership Government, and this was published last January.  This was the first thorough assessment of capacity needs across the health service for more than a decade.  In the following month, 2,600 acute beds and 4,500 social care beds were provided for and fully funded in the national development plan, based on the capacity review findings.  This is the first commitment to invest in significant additional bed capacity in many years and replaces a trend whereby, even before the troika were in town, we were reducing the number of acute hospital beds in this country.</p>  <p>  The review process was robust.  It was led by a high level steering group and drew on significant stakeholder engagement and available international and national evidence.  Its methodology and findings were then validated by an international peer review group.  The projections were based on examining current demand for services and projecting forward on the basis of demographic and other demand factors.  The analysis also took account of the potential impact of health and well-being initiatives, a shift in the provision of certain care services from the acute to the community sector and productivity improvements in our hospitals.  We all know that major improvements in these areas are needed and outlined in our Sl&aacute;intecare report, and it is important that capacity is planned around a new model of service delivery and not the current one.  I think we agree that if we just increase the bed capacity and do not reform the model of care, the beds will just fill up and we will not manage to create the health service we need to.</p>  <p>  The ESRI report referred to, which was funded by my Department, is a valuable addition to our knowledge base for health policy.  It contains projections of future demand for health services but does not contain any projections for capacity such as acute beds.  The ESRI methodology also takes no account of future changes in models of care or in productivity improvements.  It is not possible therefore to get from the ESRI model a figure comparable to the 2,590 in the capacity review report.  The baseline projections for demand in both reports, however, are broadly aligned across the range of services examined.  I should point out that the ESRI sat on the steering group for the bed capacity review that said we needed 2,590 more acute hospital beds.</p>  <p>  I have stated before that I do not believe that capacity increases alone will bring improvements in our health services, but the national development plan investment programme must be matched with a programme of reform to deliver real change.  To that end, work on a Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan is advancing in my Department and I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Here is the problem.  The capacity review says that we will need somewhere between 2,600 and 7,150 new beds.  The ESRI analysis does not give us a bed number but it does give us a bed day number, so it is quite easy to turn that into beds.  The Department's capacity review says somewhere between 2,600 and 7,150.  The ESRI report broadly agrees with that.  The capacity review says the following: "In practice the achievable shape of the future health system is likely to lie somewhere between the two extremes set out in this Capacity Review."  That would mean 4,900 new beds if we take the midpoint.  It describes the 2,600 as an extreme.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister worried that the capital plan, which is being published by the Government and which states 2,600, is essentially taking the best possible conceivable outcome, an outcome that the capacity review itself describes as one of the extreme ranges and which has been provided for?  Are we not setting ourselves up for continuing crisis if we assume we will only provide for the lowest number of beds that the PA Consulting report has come up with?</p></speech>

I welcome that there is now a political consensus in this House that we need more acute hospital beds.  That was not the practice in the past, even during the previous economic boom where, and I do not mean this in a party political sense, there was a view, even within senior levels of health service management, that we had too many hospital beds in this country.  Clearly, that myth has been dispelled.</p>  <p>  We have fully funded the 2,600 beds, which is ultimately the recommendation.  I take the Deputy's point because the bed capacity review does talk about lots of different figures, but it does recommend that this is the figure that would be used if a programme of reform were to be put in place also.  When I talk to people across the health service and look at the document that the cross-party group, the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, produced, it does say "Yes" to more hospital beds but it also says to move more into the community.  If we put all our attention on a hospital-centric model, we will be lulled into a false sense of security in not needing to move more services into the community.</p>  <p>  It is important to say also that we are not just talking about the 2,600 acute hospital beds.  We are also talking about the elective only hospitals which will provide about 600 further beds, which creates more capacity, and about 4,500 social care beds, which provide transitional care opportunities.  I agree that we need to front-load now and we need to look at the opportunities to get some of these beds in now, because whether it is 2,500 or a different figure, the health service cannot wait a significant period to get those beds.  I will discuss with Government colleagues in the coming weeks and months how we can front-load some of those beds, be it by modular build or another form.</p></speech>

I will return to the numbers.  The PA report does not recommend 2,600 beds.  What it says is, given their assumptions, the lowest conceivable number of beds we would need is 2,600.  It makes various technical assumptions, some of which are incorrect.  The 2,600 assumes massive investment in primary care and post-acute care and 2,600 beds.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, estimates the figure is 7,000.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association believes that we are short more than 2,600 beds today.  Between the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the IMO, the ESRI and the Department of Health, no one is saying we need 2,600 beds.  That has now been hardwired into the capital plan, so the Minister would appear to be providing for what his own report describes as an extreme in terms of the least possible number of beds we would need.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister prepared to go back to the Department and to PA Consulting, if needed, and ask them, in light of the fact we have provided in the capital plan a certain amount of money for 2,600 beds, how much money would be needed if various reforms do not happen?  The PA Consulting report, for example, assumes a one-to-one transfer between acute beds and primary beds.  For every primary care bed that is put in the community, one less bed is needed in the acute system.  Many experts say that is not a realistic assumption.  It would be useful for us, as we move to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, to say that while we have provided for 2,600 beds at a cost of several hundreds of millions or billions of euros, the midpoint is 4,900 beds and for that we would need an additional sum, &euro;2 billion or whatever, that we have not provided for.</p><p>Would the Minister be able to come back to the House and the committee to provide that information to us? </p></speech>

The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, confirmed to me today that at no point did it refute the capacity review figures and it was represented on the steering group of the review.  It has confirmed also that it is very clear that the projections on the two exercises were not comparable.  The Deputy is not suggesting they are as the ESRI one did not factor in the model of care or productivity improvements.</p>  <p>  The national development plan, the capital plan, is for the next ten years which brings us to 2028.  The bed capacity review runs to 2031.  We have fully funded the 2,500 three years ahead of schedule.  There are three years at the end where it will be possible to do more.  I am happy to always keep this under review.  If we deliver this additional capacity it will be the largest increase in bed capacity in a hell of a long time, if not ever, in the Irish health service.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a point about costing the reform, if we are serious about making this shift to primary care and moving more services into the community.  I will be putting costs on that as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan which I expect to bring to Government in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that if we look back to 2007 and compare the figures then to the latest figures, there has been a reduction in the number of community nurses.  If the question is pitched in terms of the timelines as the Deputy has done she is correct the figure is down.  This reflects the fact that the recruitment moratorium that was in place across the public service from 2007 had a real and lasting impact on staffing levels in the health service.  I acknowledge that and I also acknowledge that if we are talking about new services we need to staff them. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, it is important to recognise that there has been a reversal in the trend of declining numbers in more recent years.  Since December 2014, there has been a year-on-year increase in community nursing numbers which have risen from 14,539 to 15,175 as of April this year.  That is 636 extra nurses.  The Deputy has asked for a great deal of statistical data and I will of course arrange for it to be provided in tabular format.  </p>  <p>  Past staffing levels may have added to the pressures of delivering services but the commitment and flexibility of front-line staff, combined with innovative ways of working, have ensured the focus has always remained on patient care.  There are several recruitment and retention initiatives in place to assist in further bolstering nursing capacity, including offering permanent posts to graduate nurses, continuing the process of pay restoration and offering new opportunities for career development.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the need to increase capacity in public health nursing, the number of sponsorships for post registration education will rise to 160 by 2019.  This year there will be 150 sponsorships, that is, 42 additional places since 2016.  This reflects the commitment to improve recruitment and retention in nursing and midwifery.</p>  <p>  As I heard very clearly when I addressed the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, conference in Cork only a few weeks ago, it is very eagerly awaiting the outcome of the Public Service Pay Commission negotiations.  We have specifically asked the commission to consider issues regarding recruitment and retention of healthcare staff, including nurses as a new tranche of their work.  We will be guided by their recommendations on how we assist with the Deputy&rsquo;s question about recruitment and retention.</p></reply>

The Minister is offering nurses a permanent contract in a health service that has become an unattractive place to work.  I am sure the INMO members told him that at their conference - in fact, I am certain they told him that.  I acknowledge the damage caused by the recruitment moratorium introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in the health service two years ahead of everywhere else.  I campaigned against it at the time.  We warned about the impact but notwithstanding that we need to face the fact that in my area, in community health organisation, CHO, 9, the nursing numbers are down by 175 since 2007.  That is in the area with the fastest growing population in this State.  If we are to see the shift to primary care and if it is to become a reality we will need to see an absolute increase in the numbers and we are not seeing that increase.  We are not seeing a year-on-year increase in anything like the numbers we will need.  It calls into question the Government's commitment to the Sl&aacute;intecare report because the staff will not be there to effect the necessary change. </p></speech>

That work is under way.  It is nearly concluded and we will be guided as a Government by its findings.  The unions have had an opportunity to put their views on what could help with recruitment and retention issues as well.  I accept that we have a way to go to get back to pre-crisis figures for people working in nursing and community nursing.  The Deputy is correct in the data she gave in that regard.</p>  <p>  In December 2014, there were 14,539 community nurses; in December 2015, there were 14,789; in December 2016, there were 14,826; in December 2017, there were 14,874; and in April 2018, there were 15,175.  I will circulate these figures.  We are seeing an increase and we need to see a further increase.  When I talk about offering permanent jobs to graduates, the HSE has appointed 861 which is 80% of the 2017 nurse graduates.  I take the point that when we appoint them, we need to keep them in the country.  It is not just a question of recruitment but also of retention. </p></speech>

I asked for them so I am not criticising him for that.  They showed a rate of increase, and I am not brilliant at hard sums, such that by my reckoning it will probably take a decade or more to get back up to the level we were at before the crisis.  That is before taking account of the fact that we are moving away from a hospital-centred model, supposedly, although we obviously are not because we do not have the staff to do it.  We are also dealing with an increased population.  My area of north Dublin is an example.  It has the fastest growing population in the State and the number of nurses has declined.  At the rate of increase many of those people who are living in my constituency will be shuffling around looking for their pensions before they will see anything even approaching adequate community services.  Meanwhile the pressures on the acute hospital sector will not be alleviated because we do not have the staff in the community. </p></speech>

There were 1,971 community nurses there in December 2017 and that had risen to 2,074 in April 2018, which I think is an increase of 103 nurses.  I accept the point and am not contesting that we need to continue to do more to get back to where we want to be in respect of people working on the front line of our health service.  We also need to make sure that we provide more attractive working opportunities for nurses in the community.  We have a draft policy for community nursing and midwifery which is a response to an integrated model of care.  This model of care proposes one that offers the individual family and community a range of choices and will be facilitated through a variety of changes to the model so that we can have a proactive rather than reactive model of care.  The policy proposes to meet service users choice and needs as close to home as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition to dealing with the traditional ways of recruitment and retention, we are considering the career opportunities and satisfaction for community nursing.  I accept we have more to do in this area and a significant amount more to do to get back to where we were in 2007 but I contend we are beginning to make slow progress on this.  There has been an increase in recent years.  I read out the figures for the Deputy and I will circulate the table to her.  I look forward to the outcome of the Public Service Pay Commission negotiations and being guided by its recommendations.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change, published in 2006, set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  As the Deputy will be well aware, one of the key principles of A Vision for Change was a fundamental move from institutional care to community-based care.  The policy advocated for a move towards predominantly community-based care delivered by multidisciplinary teams.  In line with this policy a number of old psychiatric hospitals has been closed due to the outdated nature of such facilities.  However, the Department recognises that there will always be a need for acute beds.  As such, there are currently 1,018 approved acute beds within the HSE.</p>  <p>  Investment continues to take place to modernise this area of service and the HSE remains committed to improving rehabilitation services for people with severe and enduring mental illness and complex needs.  This includes the new 170-bed national forensic mental hospital complex now under construction at Portrane, to replace the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, along with new facilities such as a forensic child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, unit and an intensive care rehabilitation unit, which will open in 2020.  The HSE also intends to open an additional ten beds in the Central Mental Hospital as soon as possible once all necessary staff are put in place.  New acute and high observation units have also opened in Cork and Drogheda in recent years, with an additional facility in Galway set to be operational in June 2018.</p>  <p>  Many of those with severe mental illness and complex needs are discharged from acute inpatient units to a community residence, most often a high support hostel with 24-hour nursing staff available.  Community residences provide a structure and support that this group of service users most often need after discharge.  They offer an ideal place for further active rehabilitation for those who can acquire sufficient skills to become fully independent and live in their own accommodation.  However, for some service users a more intensive inpatient rehabilitation service is required.</p>  <p>  In January 2017 a national project was initiated which included developing a model of care for people with severe and enduring mental illness and complex needs.  The model of care describes a specialist rehabilitation care pathway that ensures that the requirements of people with severe and enduring mental illness are met.</p></speech>

The Health Research Board records that the rate of involuntary admission in 2016 was 48.4% involuntary admissions per 100,000 of our population.  In England, the rate in 2015-16 was 120.  It is almost 2.5 times our rate.  EUROSTAT reports that Ireland has the third lowest number of psychiatric beds per 100,000 of the population in the EU.  The EU average is 72 psychiatric beds per 100,000 of the population and in Ireland the average is fewer than half that at just under 35 psychiatric beds per 100,000 of the population, a figure questioned by Professor Kennedy only last week to the effect that it might be artificially high.  Professor Brendan Kelly states: "These are stark different differences and strongly suggest that Ireland has insufficient psychiatric beds to serve our population."</p>  <p>  The closure of inappropriate psychiatric beds in Victorian hospitals was supported in A Vision for Change and rightly so, but are we gone too far in the other direction?  Has decongregation effectively become an ideology or a method to cut costs?  We are now putting people out of centres into the community where there are not the necessary services in place nor the proper step-down beds or the proper assisted living supports for them.</p></speech>

There is no absolute answer to the query he raised as to whether we have enough inpatient beds.  Change is always difficult and the change that was envisaged in A Vision for Change was very dramatic, namely, to move away from inpatient care to community care.  As the Deputy will be well aware, it is proving to be an ongoing challenge to ensure we have the supports and staff necessary to provide the care that is needed.</p>  <p>  The review of A Vision for Change is ongoing.  An oversight group is examining that and we are reviewing it.  I am due to meet the group which is reviewing it, I believe, on Wednesday of this week.  The question the Deputy raised is still being posed.  There is the question of whether we have gone too far or have we gone far enough and, I suspect, the answer lies somewhere in the middle.  The provision of inpatient beds is probably being chased from the top.  I am trying to refocus the system and have more interventions at an earlier more localised level, whereby we could prevent illnesses escalating and the need for beds at the top.  Sometimes when we talk about beds, it can be like treating the symptom, and we can keep producing more beds when we may need to examine what is sending all those people up into the acute space that requires inpatient treatment for mental health.</p></speech>

He stated: "As a result, the key human rights issue in Irish psychiatry today is not disproportionate denial of the right to liberty due to over-custodial care, but, rather, issues concerning the right to access to an appropriate level of care when it is needed, including inpatient care."  One of the most common situations with which I deal is just such cases, namely patients who may no longer need to be in an acute unit in psychiatric department but who are not fit to be discharged.  I have dealt with patients who have serious dual-diagnosis issues.  They are discharged from acute care, they then go to the county council and may be put into bed and breakfast accommodation over a pub.  The interim beds that are required are not in place.  We have also seen complaints from the forensic mental health services at the central mental hospital where people are being kept in prisons because there is not enough beds there either.  There is a serious question to be addressed in that decongregation, in certain respects, is going too far and it needs to be very seriously considered.  It is about appropriate care, not blindly applying a particular policy.</p></speech>

When e we look at international comparisons and count the number of beds per 100,000 of the population it can be very misleading and unhelpful to the debate.  That suggests that a one-cap-fits-all approach works.  Countries have different cultures, sources and resources.  We have secure hostels with 24-hour staffing and that is a good model that works well.  It is a step-down model; it is not one where we take somebody from acute care and put them straight into the community.  It is a transitional care arrangement.  There is a crisis house down in Tipperary.  There are a number of different models in place that can work.  We have day patient hospitals and they may be the way to go in the future.  People come into the hospital and avail of treatment and supports in the day and return to their homes in the community in the evening.  There are a number of different models.  A one-cap-fits-all approach would be wrong.  If we are to continue to measure our success or otherwise within the health system by using an international yardstick and just counting the number of inpatient beds, that could be very dangerous and could miss the point.</p></speech>

I believe the HSE is far too bureaucratic and is not accountable enough.  I believe we need to move quickly as an Oireachtas to put in place an independent board to improve governance and accountability and strengthen the oversight and performance of the HSE.  We have known we needed to do that but the national screening programme has made that even clearer.  What has arisen in regard to CervicalCheck has made that very clear as well.</p>  <p>  I have now published a general scheme of the Bill.  This will provide for a nine-person non-executive board, including a chairperson and a deputy chairperson.  I want this board to include patient advocates as well.  The board will have the authority to perform the HSE's function and will be accountable directly to the Minister of the day.  The HSE will have a chief executive officer, CEO, rather than a director general, who will be accountable to the board for the performance of his or her functions.  I look forward to working with the Deputy and other Members of the Oireachtas to bring this Bill through these Houses urgently.  I have taken on board the Deputy's suggestion in regard to looking at appointing the chair of that board to have a role in the recruitment of the new CEO rather than doing it the other way around.</p>  <p>  In regard to CervicalCheck in particular, I made my views very clear on a number of occasions that I was not happy and that I had serious concerns about the way this situation had been allowed to unfold.  Recent events have shaken the confidence of many people in the programme.  That is why I acted quickly and tried to act with colleagues across this House to put an independent inquiry in place.</p><p>The inquiry is led by Dr. Gabriel Scally, Professor of Public Health at the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol.  I am aware that many of the people whose confidence in the CervicalCheck programme has been shaken are very happy with the way he is going about his work.  He is working with an international expert on women&rsquo;s health and will also be advised, as appropriate, by Dr. Hugh Annett and Professor Julia Verne.  The Scally inquiry will examine all aspects of CervicalCheck and involve engagement with the women and families affected.  The Deputy is aware that the terms of reference are very comprehensive and reflect the cross-party engagement.  A website, <i>scallyreview.ie</i>, has been set up and went live on 23 May.  It will enable the inquiry to communicate progress, including with the women and their families who have been impacted on.<br/><br/>Rather than being judge and jury, I want to await the outcome of the inquiry.  Dr Scally is due to provide a progress report on his work in the first week of June.  The full report is due by the end of June.  I will make my adjudication on specific questions on the basis of the full report.  <br/><br/>The Deputy is also aware that I have agreed to establish a commission of investigation.  Serious lessons need to be learned.  We have asked an international expert to come and get to the bottom of it; of who knew what, when and where and if people acted appropriately.  I am satisfied to wait for those few weeks to let this international expert do his job, engage with the women and their families and report back to us.</p></speech>

We are dealing with people who are in line management positions in the service.  I do not have confidence in them.  The people who are watching do not have confidence in them either.  From the revelations in emails from the Minister's Department which were given this week, the Department did ask extra questions to make sure it was not a patient safety issue.  It was a patient safety issue.  The HSE did not fundamentally understand, comprehend or get the seriousness of the issue and it is getting worse.  I am intent because while we consider it to be a live issue, the women affected are unable to get the findings of the reviews.  I hold in my hand one example.  The 209 women affected are not obtaining the documentation they require.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that the HSE will give all documentation and audit review findings to the women in question by the end of this week.  They are going to meet their consultants and being told to go through official lines to get the documentation.  This is treating women who have been treated very badly with further disdain.  That is why I do not have confidence in management.</p></speech>

We also all agreed to the terms of reference and they are very clear on the work Dr. Scally is to set about doing.  He has shown himself to be well able to get to the bottom of serious issues.  While I can absolutely understand how people who have been so badly let down cannot have confidence in elements of the health service and while I cannot speak for them, it is fair to say they can have confidence in the work of Dr. Scally who is also engaging with them directly.  What the Deputy has referred to is not good enough in any way.  It disgusts me to hear it.  Immediately after we conclude priority questions in the Chamber I will get my Department to make direct contact with the HSE to ensure all documentation and review findings - information that belongs to the women in question - will be provided for them without any bureaucratic hurdle whatsoever.  I give the Deputy my word that I will follow up on that matter now.</p></speech>

I am sure the House agrees that all of the women deserve all of their documentation after five weeks.  They also deserve all of the audit review findings.  There is one solicitor who is representing many of the women.  A total of 90% of the women he represents have not yet received their documentation.  After five weeks they deserve it.  I will lose confidence in the management structure in the HSE if management does not deal with the issues appropriately.  It let the quality assurance director of the HSE to go on holiday during what was the biggest crisis in decades.  There is also a conflict between what the State Claims Agency stated at the Committee of Public Accounts and what CervicalCheck stated about informing women, an issue to the bottom of which we will get this week.  On top of that, we are aware that there is further bureaucracy in the provision of documentation to which the women in question are entitled.  I understand the terms of reference for the Scally inquiry.  I understand that by next week Dr. Scally is to make certain decisions on what he has found.  If that does not happen, I will be shocked.  Because the issue is live and because of the fact that the women in question are not being provided with documentation to which they are entitled by the HSE, I do not believe that for some decision making we can wait until the end of the process, if Dr. Scally does not do what we expect him to do by next week.</p></speech>

I will follow up on the matter directly immediately after priority questions.  For those who are watching and to have confidence in the screening programme and that information will be given, it is important to say two things.  First, there has been a huge volume of calls in the last few week to the CervicalCheck helpline.  I am pleased to note that the overwhelming majority of the callbacks were by women asking for a clinical consultation to talk to a nurse or a doctor about their situation.  The overwhelming majority have been concluded, which is welcome.  It was a big body of work, but it was important to get through it in the interests of answering the questions of many thousands of women.  More than 11,000 required callbacks.</p>  <p>  On the issue of supports and the practical measures we have put in place to try to help people, we have put public health nurses in place in each of the CHOs throughout the State to directly meet the women and their families from the group of 209 - if I may refer to it as such.  I understand that work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  My very clear understanding from the terms of reference is that Dr. Scally will provide a progress report in the first week of June.  I look forward to hearing exactly what progress he has made.  He will provide the full report by the end of June.  I look forward to engaging with colleagues when we receive it.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-05-29a.264.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052900028#AA00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.</p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government.  Cataract surgery is among the most common surgical procedures carried out in the ophthalmology specialty.  Through the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the HSE, the overall number of patients waiting for cataract surgery has fallen by 22% since July 2017, while the number of patients waiting for more than 12 months has declined by 71% in the same period.  This is one of the areas where we are making significant progress as a result of the investment made through the NTPF.</p>  <p>  For 2018, under the inpatient-day case action plan, all clinically suitable patients waiting for more than nine months for a cataract procedure will be offered treatment this year, with 5,000 additional NTPF funded procedures planned in public and private hospitals.  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and a cataract theatre is now operational there.  This year, in line with the action plan, the HSE is planning to open a dedicated cataract theatre in Nenagh hospital in July.  This will also benefit patients from Deputy Brassil's constituency.</p>  <p>  In primary care the HSE published the primary care eye services review group's report in June 2017.  The report sets out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be provided in a primary care setting.  The recommendations made in the report are to be implemented on a phased basis.  To support implementation of the report, funding of &euro;1 million was allocated this year to establish new primary care eye support teams in south and west Dublin and further develop the primary care eye team in north Dublin to help to alleviate waiting lists.  We are making progress in this area, but we need to continue to make progress.  There were 10,304 people waiting for cataract procedures in April 2017.  In April 2018 that number had dropped to 7,818.  We are, therefore, seeing the benefits of the investment to reduce cataract surgery waiting lists.  The opening of the cataract operating theatre in Nenagh hospital in July will make a real difference.  It will provide a service for patients from counties Limerick, Laois, Kerry, Clare, Offaly, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  We have begun the roll-out of the new primary care eye support teams, but, clearly, we need to see them being spread throughout the State.  I look forward to seeing the impact of the new &euro;1 million investment.</p></reply>

One can often wait up to 24 or 36 months before even being seen.  People with such difficulties attend my clinic on a weekly basis.  It is the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has to deal with the social aspects that result from, for example, a person who was once able to drive to the local town now being unable to do so, with all of the related isolation issues.  This matter needs to be tackled.  Given all of the reports and offerings, for example, from the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Association of Optometrists Ireland, there is a potential solution, but elements are falling between the stools.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question it was pointed out to me that the primary care eye service review group's report offered interesting and progressive solutions, but I am told that no extra funding has been provided to implement the report in my area.</p></speech>

We are making significant progress.  In the 12-month period between April 2017 and April 2018, the total number fell from 10,304 patients waiting to 7,818, a decrease of more than 20%.  On the length of time people have to wait, 744 were waiting for 18 months or longer, but that figure has decreased to 326.  There were 950 waiting for 15 to 18 months, but that figure is down to 175.  There were 1,297 waiting for 12 to 15 months, but that figure is down to 295.  There were 1,468 people waiting for nine to 12 months, but that figure is down to 893.  I am giving a commitment that, through our work and investment, we will ensure that by the end of the year no one will have to wait for a cataract procedure for longer than nine months.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right, in that we could do more on two fronts.  First, we must ensure we are using all of the capacity within the acute hospital setting.  That is why I am eager to do more in Nenagh.  Second, we have started to roll out the primary care eye service review, albeit in the locations I mentioned, but I want to see it spread throughout the country.</p></speech>

In my day we used to call them opticians.  There are 352 registered optometrists who are willing to get involved and provide much needed community backup for an overloaded system.  We recently heard a presentation by the association in Buswells Hotel.  It is more than willing to get involved, particularly in screening for young people.  Squints and lazy eye syndrome are easily dealt with.  If they are, such cases do not go on to clog up the system further down the line.  However, there is resistance somewhere in the system to allowing optometrists to get involved in solving the problem associated with public waiting list.  The Minister needs to use his good offices to get to the bottom of the matter and stop it.  There is enough work for everyone in the system.  When a body is willing to get involved and help, we should facilitate it.</p></speech>

I do not want anyone to work in a silo.  There is enough work to go around.  Given the ageing demographic profile, demand for ophthalmological services will only increase.  The report of the primary care eye service review group is a good body of work, with people working in the community and acute hospital settings coming together to draw up what was effectively a model of care.  We have started to roll it out, albeit only in south, west and north Dublin, with the development of new primary care eye teams.  I want to see the project rolled out.  It will be my next challenge to deliver in the area of ophthalmology.</p>  <p>  We have seen significant progress being made in dealing with inpatient day case cataract waiting lists.  People were waiting for far too long and we will see more progress this year.  The investment in the new Nenagh clinic will see activity ramped up as we increase staff numbers there.  The clinic will see up to ten cases a week for the first 12 weeks and 30 cases a week for the remaining 12 weeks.  In 2018 the service will carry out up to 500 cataract procedures.  From next year, it could carry out 2,500 additional cataract procedures per annum.  The level of activity proposed in Nenagh will not just meet demand in the mid-west, it will also provide additional capacity to support patients from counties Limerick, Laois, Kerry, Clare, Offaly, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  There is much more we can do in dealing with this matter and I look forward to making progress on it.</p></speech>

How many women have availed of it?  What is the Minister doing to ensure their tests and results will be delivered speedily and what laboratory is involved?  We have all been astonished by the courage of Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, in particular, but there has been severe criticism recently that the package of measures is not being delivered speedily and that the Minister is not fulfilling the promises he made just a few weeks ago.</p></reply>

Not only did we appoint a national lead within the HSE to co-ordinate it, but we have also instructed that lead to ensure public health nurses are assigned in each of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, to liaise with the families.  I do not want to hear of any woman or her family having to go to a meeting in Dublin or being dragged to meet the HSE.  I want to see the infrastructure in place for a public health nurse to visit that woman or her next of kin in an appropriate setting for the family, for example, around the kitchen table in the family home.  A number of such meetings have taken place and I am informed that a great deal of progress has been made.  Without naming anyone in the D&aacute;il, I have put some of the women affected in contact with the person co-ordinating this work nationally to ensure their feedback will go directly to the HSE.  I will personally monitor the position closely.</p><p>As the Deputy knows, there was a significant downward trend in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer between 2010 and 2015 and we are seeing improvements in five-year survival rates.  For that progress to continue, it is essential that women keep participating in cervical screening.  Recent weeks have shaken confidence in many aspects of CervicalCheck, but participating in screening is vital if we are to continue to see a reduction in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer.  It is welcome that so many women who have been adversely impacted jon or treated poorly by the health service have echoed that message.</p><p>As part of ensuring women can feel trust and confidence in the CervicalCheck programme and that it is well managed and quality assured, I have asked Dr. Gabriel Scally to carry out a scoping inquiry into all aspects of CervicalCheck.  I expect him to report to me at the end of June.  He is due to produce a progress report in the first week of June.  Separately, there will be an international clinical expert review panel led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as I believed it was important to involve external persons.  It will review the screening history of all women who have developed cervical cancer and participated in the screening programme since it was established.  This will provide independent clinical assurance for women about the timing of their diagnoses and any issue related to their treatments and outcomes.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>On the number of free follow-up smear tests, the HSE has advised that this information is not available, given that there is always a time delay between when the smear test sample is taken by the smear taker and notification of the smear is received by CervicalCheck from the laboratories.  Tests are examined in three laboratories, with approximately 50% of the testing done in Ireland and 50% abroad.  All three laboratories meet quality assurance standards and are certified by the relevant national authorities.  The clinical advice is that there is no evidence that the clinical and technical aspects of the programme have performed outside or below international standards or the quality guidelines set for the programme.  However, smear tests can produce both false positive and false negative results.  I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as soon as possible as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer.  The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, the current testing mechanism, and its use would result in fewer false negative results.  Its introduction is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally.</p></speech>

Has there been contact with all of those?  What are the Minister's plans for mandatory reporting and the patient office?  Does he intend to set that up as an independent agency?  The Minister got a &euro;685 million increase in the 2018 health budget.  What kind of additional funding does he anticipate for 2019 to address some of the terrible issues that have come forward in this cervical smear check scandal?</p></speech>

The Government has made it clear in a number of decisions that whatever financial supports are required will be provided.  The Taoiseach has made it clear here on the record of this House and the Government has given me assurances about the funding of the practical measures that we are putting in place.  On mandatory reporting and mandatory open disclosure, I have received permission from the Government to progress the patient safety Bill.  That will bring in mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable incidences.  I have given an assurance that that will include issues relating to screening.  I also want to move to HPV testing this year.  I asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible.  The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology which is the current testing mechanism and it would have fewer false negative results and its introduction is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally.  It would place this country to the forefront.  I hope, by accelerating that, that it could be something positive to come with regard to women's health and screening.</p></speech>

Will he accelerate that into 2018 to move towards the HPV testing?  On the overall programme, we are approximately 12 years into the 2006 strategy for cancer control, including BreastCheck, CervicalCheck, BowelScreen and Diabetic RetinaScreen.  What type of audits are the Government and Department ordering on the whole range of cancer screening services?  How does the Minister plan to expand that?</p></reply>

I decided in February that we would move ahead with the introduction of that later this year.  I have asked that that be accelerated.  It is a big body of work.  It will also provide the opportunity for the reconfiguration of the laboratories that we are using in Ireland.  I have said on a number of occasions that this is nothing to do with safety or quality assurance.  Instinctively, I would like to be able to use Irish laboratories and develop our own services here, should that be possible.  I have asked officials to examine that.</p><p>Following on from the recent issues relating to the disclosure of the results of the CervicalCheck clinical audit, I have established the scoping inquiry being led by Dr. Gabriel Scally.  He will review all aspects of CervicalCheck and examine the other screening programmes operated by the National Screening Service, particularly relating to quality assurance, clinical audit, open disclosure and governance.  The Deputy's point is well-made.  Screening has saved lives in this country, whether BreastCheck, BowelScreen or CervicalCheck.  We know that it has saved lives.  It is also important that we continue to see if there are areas in which we can do better and if we can learn from other countries.  While we have somebody doing an external review of CervicalCheck, it seems sensible to me to ask that they would also look at the other screening programmes and examine them, particularly with regard to quality assurance, open disclosure and governance.</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, I have engaged on a cross-party basis about the terms of reference for this inquiry.  It is fair to say that they are comprehensive and reflect the issues raised by all parties in this House.  I gave the written submissions that were given to me by the Opposition to Dr. Scally and asked that not only does he act on the terms of reference, but considers all of this.  The inquiry is expected to issue its first report at the beginning of next month and its final report by the end.  A website has been established, <i>scallyreview.ie</i>, which provides a public-facing presence for the inquiry and will enable it to communicate progress with all interested parties.</p></speech>

Of those, I think 146,000 attended, which was an uptake rate of almost 75%.  It was the highest number ever screened by BreastCheck in a single year.  Why do we not have the relevant statistics for BreastCheck, for example, for 2016 and 2017?  Similarly, on the bowel-screening programme, the last figures I was able to look at were for 2012 to 2015.  When will we get a more up to date report on that?  For example, the uptake rate for bowel screening was just 40%, which seems very low.  As the Minister rightly says, the screening programme has had a tremendously positive impact on our health, although we obviously still need to spend significant funding on prevention, especially with regard to obesity.  Why do we not have more up to date reports?  Will we get more feedback on the total screening programme for the next while?</p></speech>

I envisage that it is likely that Dr. Scally's report will signpost any areas identified as needing improvements, make recommendations and outline to us what further body of work needs to be done.  I want to take the opportunity, on the record of the D&aacute;il, to reiterate the point about screening not being a diagnostic tool.  I am not suggesting the Deputy said it is but it is important that over the last weeks, we have all become very conscious of that.  The difference between screening and diagnostic screening is important.  Screening helps to save lives but it is not a diagnostic tool.  I hope that we will have an opportunity shortly to work with stakeholders, whether the Irish Cancer Society, Patients' Association, the Marie Keating Foundation or our own health messaging within the health service, to take the opportunity to promote screening but also to explain and communicate to our public what screening is and is not.  As part of its work, the HSE serious incident management team, SIMT, has examined whether a formal audit process as carried out by the CervicalCheck programme exists in BreastCheck or BowelScreen.  The examination by the SIMT found that there is no comparable formal audit process in place with either BreastCheck or BowelScreen but we have asked Dr. Scally to look at all these matters.</p></speech>

I think he told me there were 30 machines, they had an eight year lifespan and there were complaints about the kinds of machines that we were using.  Has the replacement programme that the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, referred to at that stage been completed?  Are there further improvements in that regard to take account of the views of women in particular?</p></speech>

I do not have a note available to me about that.  I will check for the Deputy if the mammogram machines have been upgraded since he last asked the question of my predecessor and will revert to him directly.</p></speech>

Hopefully he will keep his commitment to providing the healthcare services that will be required.  Going back to nuts and bolts, in north Cork, there is a dietician position vacant.  It is ironic since the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, sitting next to the Minister has dealt with other issues in north Cork, in Fermoy.</p></reply>
