    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200003#A00600"><p>The context of the discussions that I initiated with the trade unions and associations representing public servants across the public service was the need to plan and provide for a measured unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  My aims were also to secure the continuation of the productivity measures introduced under the Haddington Road agreement, honour the Government's commitments under that agreement and provide for a continuation of the stable industrial relations agreement and structures in the public service which has served our recovery well.  Any outcome also had to be consistent with our international obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact to manage our public finances in a prudent manner.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road agreement, if ratified by the trade unions, will extend the terms of the Haddington Road agreement to September 2018.  Given the complex industrial relations processes within the public service, issues on matters of local interest are raised on an ongoing basis between sectoral management and trade unions, with or without the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission or involvement by my Department.  I understand that at the time the agreement was being negotiated, the Labour Relations Commission was asked to resolve a number of sectoral discussions on matters of local interest.  These discussions do not form part of the proposed public service agreement, are not part of the overall pay settlement and are not in the document on which public servants are being balloted.  Copies of any agreed outcome to industrial relations issues in other sectors are not retained by my Department. </p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the following issues were raised by Civil Service unions with officials of my Department and agreed with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission.  First, the previously agreed approach to resolving anomalies on pay between former Health Service Executive and Combat Poverty Agency staff transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2010 will be applied from 1 January 2016.  Second, various matters raised by the Civil and Public Service Union, including an outstanding claim for loss of "bank time" which was abolished in 2010, a review of pay and allowance structures for attendants in the cultural institutions, some anomalies highlighted by the union on leave entitlements and issues relating to the redeployment of some Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine staff are to be subjects of further discussion and-or referral to arbitration, as appropriate.  Third, as a pilot, staff will again be able to take up to 1.5 days of flexi-leave per month, subject to an overall limit of 13 days per annum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200003#A00700"><p>My understanding from the Minister's reply is that it was coincidental that these discussions occurred at the time the Lansdowne Road agreement was being negotiated.  The relevant public sector trade unions probably believed the talks were an appropriate time to raise these issues as it would allow them to return to their members with something that, while not part of the deal, would perhaps make the agreement a little more saleable.</p>  <p>  I note the list of points the Minister raised.  I have also heard media reports about issues such as the fixing of the registration fee for nurses, a flexitime system for assistant principal officers, recruitment to assistant principal grade being subject to open competition, outsourcing and the carrying forward of flexitime work arrangements of up to six days per quarter.</p><p>Outside the Lansdowne Road agreement is the Minister in a position to indicate how many of these types of issues have come back to him for approval?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200004#B00200"><p>When all the senior negotiators for every trade union in the public service have been in the same building, often on the same floor and in the same rooms, as the senior negotiators for each line Department for a protracted period of time - as the Deputy will know there is a good deal of waiting time in all these negotiations - bilateral discussions can take place on issues that are not part of the pay agreement but that have been niggling or outstanding for a long time.  Sometimes those issues can be resolved over that period of time, when advantage is taken of the proximity of negotiators involving representatives of public servants and line Departments or agencies.  That is not surprising.  I have indicated the issues that were raised with my staff, for which I am responsible.  There were other issues.  For example, the Deputy instanced the registration fees for nurses and I know that issue was raised with the HSE staff and with the Department of Health negotiators who were there.  Those are issues because there were anomalies and they were addressed and resolved bilaterally, but they are not part of this agreement.</p></speech>

It can be a useful tidying-up exercise and everyone believes in taking a practical approach to issues that can be dealt with.  The Minister might comment on two issues that we were told came up in that discussion.  One issue is the question of outsourcing.  Some people believe that this agreement will restrict the level of outsourcing, which might be a value for money issue about which the Minister must have a concern.  Outside the Lansdowne Road agreement, the Minister said that some of issues we just talked about may have an impact on Estimates in line Departments.  Is it possible during a future Estimates debate that any concessions during the course of the year as a result of industrial relations negotiations could be flagged by way of a note from the line Minister explaining them?  For example if there are three, four, five six or seven points teased out, some may involve a cost or some may be cost neutral.  Is it in the public interest that people know what is going on?</p></speech>

I want to make it clear that it is not part of the overall agreement and it is not part of what has been balloted upon.  I will raise that with colleagues if people want to raise it with line Ministers.</p>  <p>  In regard to the outsourcing question, we have a procurement process which examines value for money issues very rigorously.  One of the issues, and this was raised with me directly by unions in the past, is to make sure that when one is comparing models, either procurement of a new service internally or externally, that one is comparing like with like and that all the factors would be taken into account.  Clarity in regard to that was all that was provided.  There will be, and will remain to be, in the provision of any new service a rigorous evaluation to ascertain what is the most efficient and cost effective way of providing that service to the public, whether it will be internally or externally.</p></speech>

Much of the commentary around this agreement has focused on people in lower pay grades and my question seeks to complete the picture.  I have asked the Minister the implications of this agreement for earners on annualised salaries of over &euro;65,000 and to provide detail of the full pay restoration provisions for those on the same salaries in excess of &euro;65,000 at the conclusion of the Haddington Road agreement.</p></reply>

There was also a commitment in that agreement for the restoration of the 2013 pay cuts in two equal phases.  The recent proposals for the extension of the Haddington Road agreement, which is the Lansdowne Road agreement, simply reconfirms that position.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  The Government intends to honour that commitment subject to the acceptance by the unions and associations of the Lansdowne agreement proposals.  Under these proposals, for those public servants on annualised remuneration up to &euro;110,000, restoration will be in two equal phases; the first phase of restoration will take place in April 2017 and the second phase in January 2018.  For those on annualised remuneration in excess of &euro;110,000 restoration will be in three equal phases with the first phase due to take place in April 2017 and the two remaining phases in April 2018 and April 2019.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  The pension related deduction measures contained in the Lansdowne Road agreement also apply to those on annualised salaries over &euro;65,000.  On 1 January 2016, the exemption threshold for payment of pension related deduction will increase from &euro;15,000 per annum to &euro;24,750 per annum - that is the exemption threshold - and on 1 September the exemption threshold for payment of pension related deduction will further increase further from &euro;24,750 per annum to &euro;28,750 per annum.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200004#B00800"><p>I thank the Minister for that reply which was very helpful.  Let us consider this in the round.  Rather than looking at the Lansdowne Road agreement and Haddington Road agreement separately, they must be viewed as a whole to understand what is happening in respect of what the Minister calls a measured and prudent unwinding of FEMPI.  Those earning less than &euro;65,000 will have about &euro;1,000 per annum in their pocket.  Nothing has been done about the additional hours being worked, which the Minister knows is causing great difficulties, particularly for many women, parents and carers within the public and Civil Service.  There is a very partial approach for those set of earners but once one earns over &euro;65,000 one will see a full unwinding of FEMPI in pay terms and it is in inclusive of allowances in the nature of pay between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000.  It seems to be a tale of two unwindings -  very partial for those under &euro;65,000 and comprehensive for the higher earners.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200004#B00900"><p>No.  On the contrary, the Deputy is fundamentally wrong.  The whole focus of Lansdowne Road agreement was to concentrate pay restoration initially on the lowest paid.  If one considers what has happened with the unions, that is the reason the recommendations for acceptance have come largely from the lower paid.  The ones that are resisting, such as the Association of Higher Civil and public Servants and the association representing doctors, feel that pay restoration is not quick enough for the higher paid and that is their complaint.  Therefore, the Deputy is quite wrong.   We have  to understand what FEMPI is.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts amounts to an emergency measure to cut pay.  We have to restore that because although I laid a report before the House on 29 June in regard to the need for the FEMPI legislation to continue as the economy recovers, and thankfully that recovery is continuing and please God it will continue, there will be a case to be made that the FEMPI legislation should fall and we need to have an orderly unwinding of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200004#B01000"><p>What I would say back to the Minister is that he is guilty of a very deliberate sleight of hand because he is deliberately insisting on looking at Lansdowne Road agreement and setting aside the Haddington Road agreement.  We have to view the two of them to understand what the Minister's unwinding of the FEMPI legislation looks like and what the consequences of it are.  He has provided a partial level of relief for those earning less than &euro;65,000.  I am not surprised that workers in that category and their trade unions would recommend acceptance of some relief.</p><p>That is entirely logical and if I were in their shoes, it is what I would do.  To understand the dynamics of what is going on, one must consider both the Lansdowne Road and Haddington Road agreements.  At the top of the tree, there is no pay restoration for those on more than &euro;110,000, and that is good, but for those between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000, there would be a full restoration of pay.  That is a very different approach from those earning less than &euro;65,000.  Despite the Minister's rhetoric, the focus has not really been all about the lower earners.  I acknowledge that he has given a bit but he has been far more generous to people earning more money.</p></speech>

I am now beginning to unwind that process so it does not fall by court challenge.  I am doing it in a focused, fair way, initially restoring pay to the lowest paid.

Given the Government's priority to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the public finances, I welcome the independent perspective provided by IFAC.  As this House is aware, we have undergone a significant period of fiscal retrenchment and the fiscal adjustment has enabled us to return sustainability to the public finances, created jobs and created the conditions to support a return to economic growth.  On the spending side, gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014.  During that period, current spending was reduced by nearly 10% and capital spending was reduced by half.</p>  <p>  The spring economic statement in April outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion is expected to be available for budget 2016.  Fiscal projections in the statement and the stability programme update are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.5 billion in 2016, split evenly between expenditure and tax reductions.  IFAC noted that giving information about the level of indicative fiscal space for the forthcoming budget was a welcome development in terms of fiscal transparency.  The post-2016 forecasts in the stability programme update and the spring economic statement reflect a no policy change scenario.  As highlighted by IFAC, a consequence is that the forecasts show a decline over the medium term in the overall ratio of spending to GDP and do not include provision for increases in areas such as pay bill, welfare or capital.  However, the no policy change scenario would involve a structural adjustment considerably higher than is required under the Stability and Growth Pact, and, as stated clearly in the spring statement, it is the Government's firm intention to make only the minimum adjustment required under the pact rules in these years.  This means that additional fiscal space will be available and the Government will decide on it case by case.  It will be a matter for the Government to decide at budget time.</p></speech>

The problem is that the fiscal advisory council has continually made statements and issued 11 reports but the Government picks and chooses what it likes from those reports but does not take much notice of anything that it does not like.  The council has indicated that the Government is ignoring, in its own forecasts, the tax and expenditure statements it has already made for 2016.  There is no question that we will reach our deficit target of 3% this year but the council has argued that for 2016, the Government has refused to acknowledge its own forecasts of spending pressures, tax reductions and other very important matters.  This would affect the budget adjustment, which the Minister has correctly stated is &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion.  The fiscal advisory council has argued it would be far more appropriate at a level of nearly half that number, or &euro;700 million.  Does the Minister intend to take that advice or ignore it?</p></speech>

On my way from Wexford I have seen posters about retaining a swimming pool.  The Garda station was his campaign last year.  The Deputy opposes every expenditure reduction, so I am interested as to whether he is academically interested in reducing spending or if it is an actual interest.</p>  <p>  In each of the past four and half years of this Government, we have set out our deficit targets and fiscal strategy to achieve those.  We have achieved them all comfortably.  The advice we had last year from IFAC and others was that we needed a more robust reduction in expenditure than we provided.  Last year, we did not reduce expenditure but rather increased it slightly, as the Deputy knows.  We will still comfortably meet the deficit target.  The target set out in the budget of 2.7% has been revised to 2.3%, as the Deputy knows, in the spring economic statement.  Assuming that the budgetary parameters do not alter between now and August, we will set out what will happen next year.  After that, each Government will make a determination of the split, for example, between taxation and expenditure.  That will be a matter to be debated in the election.</p></speech>

It is quite simple.  He is going to ignore completely the advice of the fiscal advisory council.  It specifically indicates that the structural deficit requirement reduction is 0.6% but the Government will come in at 0.3%.  The council has specifically warned about the real questions about the credibility of projections for Government spending.  It is a fairly tough indictment from an independent body and I wonder if there is any point in it existing if the Government is going to ignore those pieces of advice that it does not like for electoral reasons.  The fiscal council has been understanding and indicated that it understands why the Government is acting like this.  It is for electoral reasons.  It has said as much in almost totally decoded language.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister for informing the House that the IFAC is now a redundant body.  When the Government gets a report from IFAC, does it meet its representatives formally to receive and discuss the report?</p></speech>

If he listened to what I said, he would know that I welcome the creation and advice of the IFAC.  We do not necessarily accept all advice that we get.  The Deputy is quite absolutely wrong on the basic point.  The advisory council has stated that our movement towards structural balance will be of the order of 0.3% and the Government has stated that it will meet our requirement, which is a movement of not less than 0.5%.  The arbiter of this - the referee who determines the level - is the European Commission, and its evaluation of the spring economic statement is that the movement will be 0.8%.  We can take the figures and choices and, so far, the Government has been right.</p></speech>

I signed off on it on 29 June and it should now be available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009 and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2010 were introduced unilaterally by the previous Administration to deal with the fiscal crisis.  The Government introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 on foot of a referendum of the people, and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2013 following negotiation and agreement with public sector trade unions.  These Acts are collectively known as the FEMPI legislation.</p>  <p>  In my statutory role under the FEMPI legislation, I am required to carry out a review and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the operation, effectiveness and impact of the Acts and to consider whether any of the provisions of the Acts continues to be necessary.  As I indicated, my most recent report was completed and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the legislative requirements on 29 June.  Regrettably, given the scale of the financial crisis arising from the actions of the previous Administration, it is required to continue the FEMPI measures in operation.  The expenditure reductions and savings generated by the legislation remain an integral and necessary part of the financial adjustment required to meet our deficit targets under the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>  <p>  I have indicated in the report that, subject to the ratification of the proposals made by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the associations representing public servants, the Government approved my proposal to bring forward the necessary amendments to the legislation to facilitate implementation of the agreement during the course of next year.</p></reply>

He has indicated that he will make any change that might be required to the FEMPI legislation to facilitate the latest public sector pay agreement.  However, he is saying, on the one hand, that we are still in a financial emergency and, on the other, that we can give pay increases to public servants.  I agree with the latter but not the former.  The FEMPI measures were introduced in 2009 and we are now in a different landscape as a result of the agreements we put in place.  The Minister inherited these measures and largely implemented them faithfully, which has led us to a situation where there is no longer a need for the emergency measures as originally contemplated in 2009.  Will he talk to the Government Chief Whip about organising a debate on the FEMPI legislation in this House or, alternatively, arrange for a debate on the matter at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform?  I am sure the Minister would welcome the opportunity to attend a meeting of that committee to discuss the most recent report.  It would be very helpful to have that discussion before the summer recess.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the Deputy that we either have all or none of the FEMPI legislation, which is what he seems to be saying.  There is consensus arising from the previous debates we have had on these matters that the measures must be wound down over time.  We cannot take a hit of in excess of &euro;2 billion in one fell swoop.  It must be done over time so as not to jeopardise the economic progress the Government has made.  Assuming that the public sector unions endorse the Lansdowne Road agreement, the provisions in it will require legislation to bring them into effect.  I will bring that legislation to the House in the autumn, at which time we will have a full debate on the proposals.</p></speech>

The reform of the public procurement system across the public service is a key element of the public sector reform programme.  Fragmented procurement arrangements have facilitated, among other things, suppliers charging different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services.  Public procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations to deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets they must now operate.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the procurement reform programme, total savings of &euro;100 million across 2013 and 2014 have been reported by the Office for Government Procurement, OGP, and its partners.  The reform of public procurement is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in the country's economic recovery.  The recently published report of the OGP, Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013, indicates that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland.  This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion worth of expenditure across 64 large public service bodies and involving more than 35,000 suppliers.</p>  <p>  All public bodies are keenly aware of the importance of maximising the value for money achievable when procuring commonly acquired goods or services.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the OGP are designed to optimise benefits for the public service through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.  The managed print services framework agreement is no different in this regard.     </p>  <p>  Public bodies are reminded that such central procurement frameworks are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  In this regard, public bodies are encouraged to use the arrangements.  The benefits arising therefrom include cash savings, administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering, greater purchasing expertise, improved consistency, enhanced service levels and legal certainty.  Officials are also reminded that it is Government policy that public bodies, where possible, should make use of all such central arrangements.</p></reply>

The Minister of State will not be surprised to hear that I do not concur entirely with his assessment of the reformed procurement function for the State.  My view is that it has had a number of very negative consequences, but we do not have the scope to debate that issue today.  The Minister of State knows, too, that I am very positively disposed towards rigorous public procurement procedures not only to save money and enhance efficiency but also to secure a range of positive social consequences.  However, I asked him a number of specific questions which hinged on the managed print services framework agreement.  In particular, I have asked him to make it clear, whether he encourages public bodies and schools, in particular, to avail of it, that their doing so is voluntary and that there is no absolute obligation to work to the panels established under the agreement.  The reason I am asking the Minister of State to be so specific is that this is one of the frameworks that was challenged in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The challengers won and the Government and the State lost.  It is essential that the Minister of State make clear to schools that adherence to the agreement is voluntary and that they will not be penalised for failing to comply with the panels under the framework agreements.</p></speech>

We have had some useful discussions in the House on these issues, including on the legislation introduced by the Deputy which dealt with the social clauses aspect.  That is an issue the working group continues to consider and I hope to be able to report progress shortly in that regard.</p>  <p>  Circular 16/13, issued by the OGP and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, reminded public bodies that central procurement frameworks were targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  It went on to state that where a body was not in a position to utilise a central procurement framework, it should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.  That justification should take into account the full costs of running a public procurement competition.  Public bodies must comply with their obligations under national law and guidelines.</p>  <p>  In regard to SMEs, there is room for discussion on what we can do to encourage them to become more involved in procurement.  Reform does offer opportunities in this regard, both domestically and at European and international levels.  Circular 10/14 put in place a number of measures to encourage SMEs to become involved, which is something we intend to drive throughout the public service.</p></speech>

Jobs have been lost.  To the astonishment of the sector, when it approached Government and the procurement authority, it was told jobs was not their concern, it was none of their business.  That is a consequence of the lack of joined-up thinking and, I respectfully suggest, basic cop-on or sense of what is happening in the real world.  What these businesses need in accordance with the rulings of the courts is for the Minister of State to be explicit that the framework is voluntary and that there is no penalty for sourcing materials and services from local suppliers.  They also need in the instance of the MPS framework for the Department of Education and Skills to make that absolutely crystal clear in line with the rulings of the courts to schools right across the State.  Businesses and those they employ are seeking that level of assurance and clarity from the Minister of State this morning.</p></speech>

Two projects are currently in construction; the N17/18 Gort-Tuam PPP and schools bundle No. 4.  A preferred tenderer has been appointed in a further five projects; the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy PPP; the N25 New Ross bypass PPP; the Courts Service PPP; the primary care centres PPP, and the Grangegorman PPP.  The preferred tenderer is expected to be appointed at the end of the summer for the final project, which is schools bundle No. 5.  I expect that contracts will be signed in 2015 for the two roads PPPs and also the courts and primary care centres PPPs with construction then commencing on those projects this year.  It is likely to be 2016 before the contracts are signed on the remaining two projects; schools bundle No. 5 and Grangegorman.</p><p>In regard to value for money, I am satisfied that the PPP model has the potential to offer value for money for the Exchequer for a number of reasons.  First, PPPs enable the public sector to harness the innovation, expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured solely by the public sector.  PPPs also facilitate the assigning of risks to the party best positioned to manage and mitigate the risks, which has value for money benefits for the State.  In addition, PPPs involve long-term contracts where payments are linked to performance and availability over the lifetime of the project and deductions apply when the facilities are not performing or are unavailable.  This has the benefit of making PPP bidders focus on the whole life-cycle cost of projects and not just on the upfront capital cost.  These factors combined ensure that added rigour and controls are brought to the planning and delivery of PPP projects.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Under the PPP guidance there are four specific value for money, or VFM, tests that are applied over the course of the planning and procurement process, which focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result as the PPP.  The purpose, sequence and format of the four VFM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidance in order to ensure that all PPPs are regularly assessed and do, indeed, offer value for money.</p></reply>

He might send me a note on or include in the written reply included in the Official Report the details of courthouse projects and their locations.  The Minister mentioned the schools in bundle No. 5 and he might provide a list of where the five schools are.  I think he said schools bundle No. 4 is currently in the system and he might provide a list of where they are around the country.  On Grangegorman, the Minister might provide a brief outline of that project.  Is public private partnership intended to be the main method of progressing Grangegorman and the primary health care centres?  I encourage the Minister to progress with as much haste as is reasonable with schools in view of the demographic pressures facing them.  There is going to be an issue in meeting the requirements for classroom accommodation because most children are in schools with very crowded classrooms.  With the demographic changes, we need to deal with that.</p></speech>

I will go through a couple very quickly.  I expect the contracts on the N11 project to be signed within weeks.  There was a slight difficulty in regard to foreshore licensing in respect of the N25.  That is being concluded and I expect the contract to be signed within weeks.  As the Deputy knows, the tendering process for the Grangegorman project has been delayed because of legal proceedings.  That is why it is likely to be next year before construction commences.  Primary care centres are not mainly being provided through PPPs but there is a bundle of PPPs that will provide a number of them.  I will send the Deputy the list.  I am working on the capital programme with colleagues.  While I am looking at PPPs as part of it, I want to have a ceiling on the proportion of the total capital that goes to bullet payments for PPPs.  We will debate this in more detail and I will explain it further when we publish and launch the capital plan in due course.</p></speech>

He might also provide the details in regard to the schools at the preferred tender-preferred contractor stage.  He might give us a list in particular of the schools that are in the system but which have not got to that stage and which will probably commence next year and in subsequent years.  I am sure there are quite a few which have gone through the planning and land acquisition processes but which are only at the initial rather than the preferred tender stage.  It is so we can have a broader view of how PPPs are progressing into next year and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  While there is a great need in regard to schools, the Minister might also consider if PPP funding can help with house building.  Housing is probably the most significant problem which has arisen over the last couple of years.  There was no housing problem previously but we have stopped building for the last few years.  Finally, when does the Minister intend to publish the capital expenditure programme?  It must be imminent.</p></speech>

While I do not have the details in front of me, from memory Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn announced approximately 272 schools when he was Minister.  We have built all but 99 and those are in train and will be provided under the capital plan.  It is an enormous number of schools.  Obviously, we have supplemented that with PPPs.  The PPP model is an interesting one.  I opened a school in Gorey in my own constituency and the level of finish at that PPP project involved a complete fit-out, right down to automated grass cutters and a caretaker.  The teachers were amazed when they walked in.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works operates guide services at approximately 70 sites nationwide.  Some of these locations are open on a full-time basis.  However, the majority, approximately 46, are open seasonally on various dates between April and October.  The guided visitor sites operated in Galway and Mayo and their relevant opening arrangements this year are that Athenry Castle is open from 3 April to 22 October; Aughnanure Castle is open from 3 April to 26 October; D&uacute;n Aonghasa is open all year; Portumna Castle and Gardens is open from 3 April to 25 September and subsequently on weekends only until 26 Oct; Pearse's Cottage was open over Easter from 17 to 21 April, and is open from 22 May to 3 September; and in Mayo the C&eacute;ide Fields are open from 3 April to 29 October.  All of these details are available to visitors through the main web information portal of the Office of Public Works, which is <i>www.heritageireland.ie</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy appreciates, a number of sites may from time to time be unavailable for particular reasons.  For example, a number of castle sites have no opening, or limited access to grounds only, because of urgent work being undertaken to electrical systems.  Generally speaking, while the OPW tries to keep such works to a minimum to avoid the main visitor season, it is not always possible to do this and some interference in the delivery of visitor services may result.</p><p>Representations are sometimes made to extend opening dates at sites.  However, it is not feasible to do this in all cases given, in particular, the significant constraints on budgets.  The OPW is open to the possibility of entering into arrangements with committed and organised local partner groups which might be interested in providing limited access to sites in the off season on a volunteer basis.  A number of successful initiatives in this regard have been arranged.  I thank the community groups which do this because no matter what resources the OPW has available it would never be possible to open all of the sites to the maximum so we do rely on community support.</p><p>The OPW has sought to encourage more people to visit heritage sites and with this in mind, introduced the free Wednesday scheme in 2011, allowing free entry to all visitors on the first Wednesday of each month.  This has been a popular initiative.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In 2014 for example, the OPW recorded approximately 79,600 complimentary visits on these dates.  The detailed position on Galway and Mayo sites, where there were 6,711 free admissions in 2014 under this scheme, is as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Site</th><th>Free Weds Admissions</th><th>Total Admissions</th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Athenry Castle</td><td>743</td><td>13,532</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Aughnanure Castle</td><td>1,161</td><td>32,289</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>D&uacute;n Aonghasa</td><td>2,719</td><td>121,001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Portumna Castle and Gardens</td><td>679</td><td>15,211</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pearse's Cottage </td><td>151</td><td>7,206</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>C&eacute;ide Fields</td><td>1,258</td><td>28,484</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td>6,711</td><td>217,723</td></tr></table>As stated earlier, opening hours at sites vary throughout the year.  At some sites for example, it would clearly be unsafe to operate late in the afternoon during winter and these sites must operate within safe tolerances.  During the summer season, it is feasible to operate later in the evening and at certain sites, with a high visitor demand, later opening is employed.  This is particularly the case at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Cashel, where visitor facilities have been open until 7 p.m. during summer months for some years.  This extended opening will also be introduced this year at Kilmainham Gaol for the first time, recognising the huge appetite among visitors for that particular site.  It is not, however, economically viable to open later at the broad range of sites as there would not be a viable case to be made for the additional costs involved when the volumes of visitors are not sufficient to justify the investment.</p><p>All visitor service provision at OPW-managed heritage sites are kept under review and should circumstances dictate a different approach in the future, some of these arrangements can be modified appropriately.  In some cases the OPW must be mindful that for conservation reasons access to a site experiencing over-pressure of visitors may need to be curtailed to ensure the historic fabric is not damaged.  It is also appropriate, of course, to have some regard to certain more explicitly commercial considerations, given the fact that under changes introduced during 2013, the OPW can retain a certain proportion of income earned for reinvestment in the heritage estate.  This may dictate a different approach in the future in regard to issues such as admission charges, franchise fees and so forth.  The free Wednesday scheme, for example, which was designed to support the tourism economy at a particularly difficult time, may also need to be reassessed having regard to the income possibilities foregone.  All these matters should continue therefore to remain under review to ensure that the right blend of management measures is applied for the circumstances facing the OPW.  However, in all cases the OPW will operate from a general principle of maintaining a high level of public access, mindful of the central place occupied by many of these sites in the tourism economy and as part of the social and historic fabric of local communities.</p></reply>

I welcome the first free Wednesday initiative.  We are coming up to its fourth anniversary and I am aware of the success of the initiative locally.  The Minister of State mentioned areas in Mayo and Galway including the C&eacute;ide Fields, Athenry Castle, Aughnanure Castle, D&uacute;n Aonghasa, Portumna Castle and Gardens and Pearse's Cottage.  There are big plans for Pearse's Cottage as part of the 2016 commemoration, and the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, will visit there next Monday.</p>  <p>  We have a rich built heritage nationwide, particularly in Visitors Galway.  This needs to be linked to the Wild Atlantic Way, which is another wonderful initiative of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  Our tour guides have extensive knowledge of the sites in question.  I understand there is a possibility of a recruitment competition later in the year, which will confined to seasonal guides and information officers employed at present by the Office of Public Works.  This is in conjunction with the unions, as it is their wish that it be confined to those in seasonal employment at present.  Some people have been in seasonal employment for up to 16 years which is of concern to them.  I welcome the recruitment competition.  Does the Department have a strategy for the protection and promotion of built heritage?  Does the Minister of State see any other initiatives which could be evolved within budget?</p></speech>

Athenry Castle had 743 visitors on free Wednesdays last year out of a total of 13,532 visitors.  I will make these figures available to the Deputy.  All in all, more than 6,700 people visited our heritage sites in Galway and Mayo on the free Wednesdays and more than 217,000 people visited those same sites in Galway and Mayo during the entire year of 2014.  In addition to this being great for promoting our heritage it is also hugely economically beneficial in Galway and Mayo.</p>  <p>  The guide service of the OPW is a key element of the presentation to visitors and it forms a significant part of the OPW's protection regime for the site.  They present the sites in an entertaining and engaging way.  Our guide workforce numbers include 82 permanent staff, and rise to approximately 350 including seasonal staff during the peak summer season.  The resource is funded through the OPW vote, and in the current year &euro;7.217 million has been provided to fund this element.</p>  <p>  We look forward to working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in aligning our objectives with the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works approaches these issues with a view to wanting to engage with the community.  We are very reliant on community support.  The success of the OPW in presenting our heritage is based on this collaborative approach between community organisations, local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works.  I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for introducing a scheme in 2013 whereby some of the funds generated at our heritage sites can be ploughed back into further investment in them.  This had never previously been available to the office of Public Works, and we are beginning to see significant progress in a number of areas.

In its recent report, IFAC commented on the demographic pressures on expenditure in the context of the forecasts made in the Spring Economic Statement, SES.  As the demographic profile of our population changes, certain sectors, including social protection, health, and education, will face additional demands.  In my statement to the House on the SES, I outlined that demographic changes in the health area will cost an estimated &euro;200 million per year over the coming years, the cost of the contributory and non-contributory State pension schemes is projected to increase by &euro;200 million per year out to 2026, and by 2021 we will need an extra 3,500 teachers at primary and secondary level. </p>  <p>  However, expenditure demands in other areas are also changing.  Key priorities of the Government have been to provide a societal safety net for those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis, with expenditure on live register-related payments increasing significantly in recent years, and to create the environment for a sustainable recovery in employment.  Unemployment has reduced from its peak of more than 15% in 2012 to 9.7% most recently.  With this recovery in employment, expenditure on live register-related payments has reduced.</p><p>The fiscal projections in the spring economic statement for the post-2016 period reflect a no policy change scenario from an expenditure perspective, other than provision being made for an increase of &euro;300 million in gross voted expenditure per annum to offset demographic pressures outlined above in sectors that account for 80% of gross voted current expenditure in 2015.  In addition, given the improvements forecast in the labour market, with unemployment forecast to fall from 9.6% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2020, certain live register related savings will make funds available to meet expenditure pressures in other areas.  This is the balance we have struck in formulating the statement.</p></speech>

That is probably the reason for the fiscal advisory council's analysis.  I do not think anyone believes &euro;200 million will be adequate for health in light of our ageing population.  Supplementary Estimates are introduced annually for sums in the order of &euro;600 million.  The fiscal advisory council pointed out that the old age dependency ratio, that is, the population aged over 70 years in proportion to the working age population, is expected to rise by 2% by 2020 and to continue rising thereafter.  That is one of the most significant issues that have to be taken into account.  It is not just a question of pensions because there are implications for the health budget and demographic pressures.  There is insufficient transparency in the document in terms of spelling out those details.</p></speech>

We previously submitted stability programme updates to Brussels after fairly cursory debates, but the spring economic statement is a new departure.  The Deputy is correct that forecasts for demographic pressures in health do not take account of any new services or drugs that might be needed, some of which may be expensive.  This is why, in general terms, we publish the spring economic statement on a no policy basis.  Real-time decisions will be made by Governments based on the fiscal space available to them in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and on the divide between expenditure and tax.  These decisions will have to be made yearly.  Despite these caveats, I consider it a good exposition of where we think the economy is currently placed, the fiscal space available to us next year and our intentions in respect of the divide between tax reductions and further public expenditure.  Decisions on these areas will, of course, be refined at budget time.</p></speech>

What we are getting does not reflect the Government's intentions.  The Minister admitted this is a first stab at the new procedure.  We have this document six months before the budget thanks to the European Semester rules.  Similar statements are being made in the other parliaments at the same time because we all have to publish our budgets by mid-October.  However, this is not the first time we made such statements.  Last year the Government published its economic forecasts without a debate in the Chamber.  The reason for our debate this year was to allow the Government to claim it is doing wonderfully in the run up to the election.  The document issued 12 months ago indicated an adjustment of &euro;2 billion would be required but by the time of the budget &euro;1 billion was available in the opposite direction, which means the spring forecast was out by &euro;3 billion.  I do not know how inaccurate it will be this year but there is no basis for assuming the forecasts in the spring statement will bear any relation to the figures announced on budget day.</p></speech>

The economic situation improved more than we prudently forecast in the stability programme update.  We did not issue a spring economic statement before this year.  We issued a stability programme update, which is a different animal.  The update is a technical set of documents prepared for the European Commission in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact.  These updates are prepared annually and, while they are managed by the Minister for Finance, I understand they were subject to cursory debate.  This year we presented a more robust analysis to the House and the nation.  That is a new departure in terms of how we prepare economic policy, and as we emerge from our difficult years, it will be a useful exercise in preparing for the budget in October.  It is preferable to the old approach whereby the Minister for Finance kept everything as a great secret until the budget was announced.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners spent more than &euro;500,000 to establish a paper-based system for returning the local property tax which could have been more efficiently delivered through the local post office network.  Every sub-post office has the same information technology system as the GPO in Dublin.  Rather than maintaining separate systems, we should be making use of the resources available through this network.</p></reply>

Efforts aimed at reducing the amount of paper-based processes in the public service have been under way for a number of years.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government approved the ICT strategy for the public service earlier in the year.  The strategy has five key strategic objectives which set the future direction for innovation and excellence in ICT in public service.  In line with the public service reform plan, the focus of the strategy will be to enable delivery of better outcomes for citizens and businesses.  The focus of the digital first stream of the strategy is the digitisation of key transactional services and the increased use of ICT to deliver improved efficiency.  My Department is working with other public service bodies to identify candidate projects to drive innovation in the delivery of services.  One outcome of these initiatives will be to remove paper from the process.  In addition, my Department is working with public service bodies to support innovation in the use of data to enable delivery of integrated services and improve decision-making, openness and transparency.  These innovations will contribute to reducing paper-based processes in the public administration.</p>  <p>  My Department is making major strides towards a paperless working environment.  We have introduced a system for electronic processing of parliamentary questions which has cut down on a huge amount of paperwork.  This is complemented by an e-submissions system which encompasses submissions to myself and to senior management in the Department.  Measures like this will also be foundation blocks for my Department's move to an electronic documents system which will ultimately see the fading away of paper files.  This greater use of electronic work processes will also assist policy-making and research and retrieval for both archival and freedom of information purposes.</p></speech>

While it is commendable that his Department is endeavouring to reduce volumes of paper, it will continue to be necessary to maintain a paper-based system.  In regard to the example I gave earlier, people were encouraged to submit the local property tax online but the Revenue Commissioners were none the less required to spend &euro;500,000 to put in place a paper-based system to facilitate those who are not technology literate or who do not have access to the Internet.  We could abolish paper-based systems across the board if we used the local sub-post office network.  The post office information technology system is the same in Cahirciveen and on O'Connell Street in Dublin.  By utilising that network we could make significant savings across the public service.</p></speech>

We obviously have to have access for all citizens.  We cannot simply decide to do it electronically only and have a whole category of citizens excluded from availing of services or even being frightened to go to a public library or post office.  The Deputy will have dealt with people in his office, as I have, who are intimidated by receiving a letter with a harp on it, much less the notion that they have to fill in a form online.  We have to have much more than a resource base with online services available.  We also need to provide training and have local dimensions about which the Deputy talked.  The notion of using post offices is not a bad one.  The T&aacute;naiste, for example, is developing concepts to use post offices for a range of services.  The biggest user of post offices is overwhelmingly the State.  More than 80% of the revenue generated in local post offices is from State-based services.</p></speech>

Its staff are the only non-State employees who sign the Official Secrets Act.  There is a mechanism for them to assist people in filling in forms and inputting data online.  Not only could we save a lot of money, but the other great advantage is that there would be far fewer errors and less fraud involved.  As mistakes could be identified more quickly, people would be paid sooner if they were seeking grants or other supports.  The system would drive efficiency across the public service.  Will the Minister or his officials engage directly with An Post and Mr. Bobby Kerr's working group to see how, in using a pilot scheme initially, this measure could be implemented?  A labour-intensive, paper-based system is being used.  Let us see if we could get this new system fully operational.</p></speech>

We need to ensure what we do is robust and actually delivers what is intended.  During the Irish EU Presidency we passed three new procurement directives to make the procurement of services simpler.  They will be transposed into Irish law in the coming year.  We are always looking at new delivery systems that would be more efficient and effective in delivering public services.  We now have more than 400 services online and do not need a locations for the vast bulk of them because most people can access them from home 24 hours a day.  That demonstrates their efficiency.  Post offices have an extremely important role to play and are very dependent on State services.  The T&aacute;naiste was happy when they won the procurement contract for the provision of social welfare payments.  In an open competition, however, one cannot always assume that they will win.  We need to map a future for post offices which will not be dependent on always winning any set of contracts.</p></speech>

This is turning out to be a positive day, but we will see how long that lasts.</p>  <p>  Why does the Minister not have access to, or sight of, the expenses of other Ministers?  This has happened in other contexts where the Minister's Department has an overarching umbrella, yet when questions are asked - this being a particular instance - the Minister says it is a matter for the line Minister or Department.  I would have thought that his departmental officials would have their beady eye across the board.  He should be able to provide me with the information on each and every Minister.  He might give the aggregate figure for his own personal expenses in the period outlined.  As he is aware, this is a vexed issue owing to the hardship faced by many families outside the Chamber.  In addition, it is the vouched and unvouched nature of some expenses which needs to be ironed out.</p></speech>

I will clarify the position for his benefit and that of the House.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently stated the supply of water and wastewater will remain in public ownership.  This principle was enshrined in the Water Services Act, 2007 and reaffirmed in the Water Services (No. 2) Act, 2013.  The 2013 Act prohibits the shareholders of Irish Water, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the board of Irish Water, from disposing of their shares.  The Government believes the public ownership of water services is the will of the people and introduced further legislation in the Water Services Act 2014 to ensure that if any future Government sought to change this position, it would be required to put the matter before the electorate in a plebiscite.  That is provided for in the Bill.  We have been accused of creating smokescreens, but using the red herring of privatisation is a smokescreen.</p>  <p>  This point does not refer specifically to the amendment, but that is where the focus should be.  As I stated on numerous occasions yesterday during the debate on these amendments which took up almost four hours, I am surprised Deputies say they are not being given enough time to discuss the Bill.  They spent four hours in a repetitive and disruptive session yesterday, but if they choose to do so, there will be ample opportunities to discuss all of the amendments tabled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200011#J00700"><p>I will start by responding to the comments made by the Minister of State on the character of the debate.  It seems that some terms are being conflated or, at any rate, bloated.  Last night in raising a point of order there was a reference to "fascism" and today we have heard a reference to a "disruptive debate".  I encourage anybody watching to read the transcript or watch the debate we had on a very important group of amendments, one in particular and the others which pivot around it.  Anybody who does this will see that it was not disruptive.  The Government's problem is that it considers democratic debate to be disruptive.  It considers it disruptive to raise questions.  It also considers democracy, as in the case of Greece, to be disruptive.  I reject the notion that any of the debate was in any sense disruptive.  We are trying to get to the bottom of this matter, but the Minister of State did not help us in the course of that four hour debate.  He did not explain why more money was being transferred in one step from the local government fund to the Exchequer and, in another, from the Exchequer to Irish Water, nor did he justify it.</p>  <p>  This is connected to the point about privatisation, about which the Minister of State spoke, because it relates to the fattening of Irish Water in preparation for its future privatisation.  The idea that we should take the Minister's and the Government's word that they are not going to privatise it stretches credibility in terms of our role as Opposition Deputies and the history of politics in this country and of water charges, in particular.  One of the two parties in government was elected on a platform of opposing water charges;- nobody is paying them, but the Government is trying to implement them.  We do not accept its promises.  Should we accept the provision in the legislation, as it stands, that should a future Government want to privatise Irish Water, it would have to hold a plebiscite?  Is that a guarantee against privatisation?  The answer is no, not at all.  On the one hand, a Government which wanted to privatise could hold and lose a plebiscite and subsequently, on the other, legally, sell off as there would be no obligation to follow the outcome of the plebiscite.  Is it not the case that a future D&aacute;il would be free to amend the legislation to remove the requirement for a plebiscite?  I ask the Minister of State to come back on this point and be very clear on it.  Each D&aacute;il is sovereign and has the right to do whatever it likes from one day to the next.  This D&aacute;il cannot constitutionally bind a future D&aacute;il to holding a plebiscite.</p></speech>

It is another empty promise from the Government.  The Minister did not answer the points about the privatisation which is happening now, never mind that might potentially happen in the future.  This is privatisation from below, with the design, build and operate contracts going to major multinational water companies, some of the biggest in the world that are interested in profit.</p></speech>

It is a very clear amendment, tabled by me and Deputies Joe Higgins and Ruth Coppinger.  We propose, in the third line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), to delete the words "or more than one".  Currently the amendment reads, "Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015, pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance".  Why on earth do the Government and the Minister want to have the ability to make multiple payments from the local government fund to the Exchequer that can, in turn, be handed over to Irish Water?  Why would there be a need for more than one payment and why can the Government not accept the amendment in order that, at the very least, only one transfer could be made?  The Government has not made any reference previously to more than one payment being made.  How many transfers does it intend to make in 2015?  How many does it intend to make in 2016, 2017, 2018 and onwards?  This is a very important question which the Government has failed to answer.</p>  <p>  The second amendment to amendment No. 20 has also been tabled by me and Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins.</p><p>We propose, in the fourth line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), after &quot;Finance&quot;, to insert &quot;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas&quot;.  Currently, it states that it can make one or more than one payment from the fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.  We would add the words &quot;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas&quot;.  That is a democratic check and accountability.  It is saying that we will not today, later this evening, or whenever, sign up and give the power to the Minister to make one, more than one or 100 transfers as he or she, a he in this case, may wish.  Instead, we are saying it would have to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>What is the problem?  Why is the Government so scared of democracy?  Why is it so scared of having this debate in a proper manner?  Why is it so scared of having the ability of this House to debate the making of a payment?  Why should the D&aacute;il and the Seanad not have the right to examine the transfer of this serious amount of money?  Why should we give the Minister for Finance <i>carte blanche</i>without a reference back to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  This is a reasonable amendment.  It is reasonable for the Government to accept it but instead it proposes not to do so.  Unfortunately, this demonstrates the kind of respect which has and is being shown to democratic procedure in the course of this debate.  It has also been demonstrated by the Government in its proposal regarding the power of the Minister for Finance in this area.  <br/><br/>The third amendment Deputies Coppinger and Higgins and I have tabled is, in the second line of paragraph (c), proposed to be inserted by section 42(b), to delete &quot;&euro;540 million&quot; and substitute &quot;&euro;1&quot;.  The Government's amendment states, &quot;The total amount of all payments made under paragraph (a) shall not exceed &euro;540 million.&quot;  We propose to change that to read, &quot;The total amount of all payments made under paragraph (a) shall not exceed &euro;1.&quot;  The reason for that amendment is very simple.  We do not believe that half a billion euro should be taken from the local government fund, handed to the Exchequer to, in turn, be handed to Irish Water.  We are opposed to the section as a whole, but if a transfer has to be made, it should be a transfer of &euro;1.  How can the Government justify pumping more money - &euro;500 million of car tax and other Exchequer funds - into the beast that is Irish Water?  How can the Government justify it when it is trying to get people to pay water charges by using the rationale that they have not already paid them?  The Minister interestingly admitted yesterday evening that they had paid them.<br/><br/>How can the Government justify that huge amount of money and transfer?  Is it justified by the fact that payment levels are lower than previously expected or that they are effectively on the floor?  Perhaps payment levels are below 50% and that is why the Government and Irish Water are refusing to give those figures despite our repeated requests.  Why can the Government not accept that if it needs to make a transfer, it can make a transfer of up to &euro;1 rather than &euro;540 million?  With our amendment the Government could make a transfer of less than &euro;1.  If it needed 50 cent, 60 cent or 70 cent, that transfer could be made within the framework of the amendment we have tabled.  The Government has not put forward a good, clear argument as to why it has rejected that amendment at this stage.  I am very interested to hear the Government's response and to respond to it in turn.</p></speech>

Yesterday evening I asked the Minister of State whether I am correct in understanding that what this amendment seeks to do is give the Government the power to transfer up to &euro;540 million from the local government fund to the Exchequer this year, which money I understand in practice would then be sent to Irish Water <i>in lieu</i>of the money which used to go directly to the local authorities for water and sewage.  When the Minister of State transfers the amount in question will there be a euro for euro transfer of money from the Exchequer, that is, his Department's Vote, to Irish Water?  Is that what is intended?</p><p>The second matter which is germane here is that it is very unusual for legislation, where a situation is to be ongoing, not to provide for it into the future.  In other words, if the Government thinks there will be further transfers from the local government fund to the Exchequer next year and in subsequent years, it is unusual that the Bill would not provide for it.  It would mean the Government will have to come back in again next year with primary legislation and go through this whole process all over again.  That is highly unusual. </p><p>We need clear answers so that we can make our mind up on the amendment.  Is it unforeseen that there will be further transfers from the local government fund next year to the Exchequer?  What valid reason in legislative process has the Government given for not providing for it in the legislation?  For example, why does the section not read, &quot;Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015 [and in subsequent years], pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.&quot;  I have no problem with more than one payment because whatever sum one arrives at, it does not matter if it is ten payments or two payments, it is the same sum of money.  The amendment goes on to say that the sum cannot be more than &euro;540 million.  Can the Minister of State explain why it does not provide for a payment in 2015 and on an annual basis in subsequent years?</p><p>I do not understand and would not support Deputy Murphy's first amendment to this Government amendment.  I do not understand his objection to payments in instalments.  The total sum will be the same amount of money.  His amendment is unnecessarily constraining.  I presume the reason for it, and the Minister of State might clarify the issue, relates to allowing for the possibility of transferring, say, &euro;300 million but deciding later in the year that Uisce &Eacute;ireann needed more money and then transferring a further sum.</p><p>The Government might decide that its capital programme had gone faster than anticipated and it could spend money usefully in upgrading the pipes, for example.  We would all welcome that.  I have no problem in the ability to transfer money as the Government needs it.  That makes sense, and if I was in the Minister's shoes, I would like that facility.  However, this is a contentious issue and given the structure by which the Government is doing it, I must support amendment No 2.  It provides that as the Government transfers money, it would have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That makes a good deal of sense and I call on the Minister of State to accept it.  I believe it would allay suspicion.  The more we are open and transparent in respect of water, the better.  The more the fanciful rumours going around can be allayed, the better.  People who are secretive about their business always encourage paranoia, even when it is unfounded.</p> <p> Amendment No. 3 is tabled by the two Deputies Murphy.  We could substitute &euro;1 million for &euro;540 million but in the greater scheme of things &euro;1 million would not do much.  It is such a small proportion of what the Government seems to require.  If that is what the Government believes, it would be far better to have tabled an amendment to delete the section and simply oppose the section in total.  Effectively &euro;1 million is not worth a candle here.  I cannot agree with it because if the Government did not give money - money was always given from the local government fund to Uisce &Eacute;ireann - the organisation would be rather short of funds.  Basically, what the Government is doing, although it is going around the mountain to do it, amounts to providing money from the local government fund for the provision of water and sewerage services in the country.  Can the Minister of State confirm that de facto this is what the Government is doing, albeit in a two-step process?  Can the Minister of State confirm the Government will have to come back with new legislation if it wishes to transfer money next year?  Does the Government expect to seek such a transfer next year and in subsequent years?  Will the Minister of State explain why the legislation does not provide for that?  Will the Minister of State confirm whether the money going from the local government fund to the Exchequer will be passed on, euro for euro, from the Exchequer or the Department's Vote to Uisce &Eacute;ireann or will it be held in the central coffers of the Department and used for other purposes?  I hope I get clear answers.</p> <p> Again, I apologise for not being in the House at the beginning of the debate.  I imagine the Minister of State understands that even Fianna F&aacute;il people cannot be in two places at the one time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200013#L00200"><p>We are dealing with three amendments.  The most substantial, amendment No. 20, has serious implications.  The problem with the amendment is that the public knows at this stage what is happening and what has been happening to date.  They have been following the succession of money transferred in one form or another, whether the &euro;540 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the &euro;500 million loan that is now being transferred onto the State's balance sheet, which flies in the face of the reason Irish Water was set up in the first place, or the write-off of &euro;59 million in rates to local authorities.  Of course, local authorities will have to pick up the tab for that.  Who funds the local authorities?  It is Joe Public.  Joe Public has to pick up the tab.</p>  <p>  Throughout last year and the year before I tried to find out the different funding streams and methods of funding for this corporate monster we call Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Some of the earlier answers were as clear as mud and diversionary.  They were not in any way clear.  Instead of getting figures for one year we got figures grouped together covering more than a year.</p>  <p>  The point is that the total sum going over comprises a handsome amount.  The Government is presenting an amendment to the effect that a figure shall be transferred over not exceeding &euro;540 million.  I presume this &euro;540 million is for the current year and that it serves to cover the cost of the &euro;399 million that is on the State's balance sheet which went to Irish Water for operational costs and the &euro;222 million in capital costs.  The water conservation grant is separate and will come out of the social protection budget.  As I recall it, that figure was not in the social protection budget last year when it was being put together, but I am open to correction on that.  If it was not and if up to &euro;130 million has to come out of the social protection budget, where does that leave the shortfall in social protection funding?</p>  <p>  Let us add together everything transferred back onto the State's balance sheet.  This is why I am concerned about the &euro;540 million.  The figure includes the &euro;500 million loan that the Government transferred onto the State's balance sheet in December and &euro;59 million in rates, for which local authorities will take the hit.  This brings us to &euro;559 million.  There is a further &euro;399 million subvention for operational costs, &euro;222 million for capital subvention and &euro;130 million for the water conservation grant.  It is not a water conservation grant; it is simply a carrot or inducement.  The Government knows it must have incentives tied in to such a grant for it to operate.  The millionaires can fill their swimming pools ten times over every day and still receive that grant.</p>  <p>  Is the &euro;540 million a once-off payment?  It is in this legislation.  That is what it looks and feels like.  Is it the case that the Government will come back next year to look for a further &euro;540 million or &euro;640 million?  That is the question.</p>  <p>  The public is concerned because there is a correlation between what is spent and what the public will have to cough up some day.  That day will probably come sooner rather than later, because the legislation setting out the charges can be changed.</p>  <p>  The energy regulator was moved to one side.  Effectively, the Government pushed the regulator out of the way.  In the past six months &euro;1.31 billion is what all this money amounts to.  That does not include the &euro;540 million for the meters and the &euro;300 million borrowed for capital works, borrowed on the private markets at a higher interest rate than borrowing on the State's balance sheet.  When we add these to the figure, we are almost up to &euro;2 billion.  If this amendment is passed and the &euro;540 million is waved through using the Government majority, will it leave the way open for the Government to come back next year looking for a further figure, or is this a once-off arrangement?  That is the question.  The public knows all this money has gone across and they know what is yet to go.  Even if we take out the costs of meters, it comes to &euro;1.61 billion according to the Government figures.  That is what the figure amounts to at this stage.</p><p>That is now on the State&rsquo;s balance sheet.  Any answer one gets in this regard cannot change that, it is in the legislation.  The &euro;59 million rates shortfall must be made up by the public, as must the &euro;399 million subvention for operational costs and the &euro;222 million for capital costs.  The money for the water conservation grant will come in taxation.  I have no problem paying that tax.</p></speech>

One can twist this whatever where one likes.  The fact is that one does not have to do anything for the grant.  Any Member of this House can claim the grant, which is ludicrous.  The problem with the grant is that one does not have to do anything for it.  However, if it were available for a specific purpose, such as improving water supply, it would make more sense.  It depends on whether the Government has this money.  It must have it because it has been put into the accounts.  The Government can twist and wriggle on the spit whatever way it wants with the &euro;130 million, but the fact is that it could use the money for real water conservation or real improvements.  It could actually offer a water conservation grant to save water if conditions A, B and C were met.  The Government has not done that.  What it is doing is dishing out the money like confetti as a carrot.  Of course, the public knows that behind every carrot there is a big stick, and the stick is normally bigger than the carrot.</p>  <p>  The question of the &euro;540 million must be addressed.  Here we go again.  With the Bill before Christmas, the Government moved &euro;500 million across onto the State's balance sheet.  With this amendment, it is going to pilfer &euro;540 million again.  Is this the final step or is the door open to do this next year?  Can the Minister of State confirm he will not do this next year?</p></speech>

I have questions on this that need to be examined.  If this were Committee Stage, we would be dissecting how Irish Water is to be funded.  Why are we carrying out the transfer in advance of seeing what is obtained from the payment of the water charges, for example?  How do we even know that the &euro;540 million will be required?  Perhaps a 100% payment will be received from the water charges, for example, or at least 70% based on registration, and the Government will not require the &euro;540 million.  I believe this step is premature.  I am sure the Minister is trustworthy but what about future Ministers who might use this very powerful instrument without any reference to the Oireachtas?  Our amendment proposes that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to approve any transfer of funds from the taxpayer to Irish Water.  Clearly it is a question of the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  The Minister made a point last night that I believe is very useful.  This debate might not be useful in many ways but the Minister did make some points in which he verified that what is happening is not new.  Car tax has been used in the past to pay for water services.  Anti-water charges campaigners and many others have been saying this for a while.  How much was used in the past?  We need this kind of information.  Is the amount under discussion an increased amount?  How would it compare with when local authorities controlled their own water services?  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but my information is that water services generally cost &euro;1.2 billion to supply from the sky to the tap in Ireland.  Some &euro;0.2 billion came from businesses and the rest was provided through general taxation.  Therefore, &euro;1 billion was derived in the past from car tax and other local government funding.  The Government is now asking for &euro;500 million but there was &euro;500 million last year also.  How is the other &euro;500 million to be made up?  One cannot get it from the water charges.  There is no possible way that they would be sufficient.  Will the Minister be coming back for more money later in the year to make up the other &euro;1 billion?  Those are questions that need to be answered.  This is why the Minister should have given Deputies a chance to discuss this on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I am opposed to the Minister having unilateral power without any reference to the Oireachtas.  How does he envisage using this measure in the future?  I, as a member of the environment committee, would have liked to have had a chance to discuss this on Committee Stage.  We have not had Irish Water before the committee, only the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We should have Irish Water in to show on PowerPoint slides how it envisages funding itself with the &euro;540 million it has been given by the taxpayer.  This is nice seed capital to start off a company.  However, how will Irish Water make up the rest of the money?  Apparently, there is a cap until 2017 or 2018, introduced by the Minister.  There are so many unanswered questions.  We should not be giving the money and handing the power to the Minister until we have answers to those questions.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, spoke yesterday, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and attacked Members on this side of the House for never coming up with solutions.  We did come up with them and I will not repeat them.  We proposed solutions several times because the Minister kept saying we were not proposing them.  We outlined four mechanisms, a including wealth tax and a financial transactions tax.  Imagine what would occur in respect of corporation tax.  Imagine asking corporations such as Apple, Google, Starbucks, Facebook and all the companies lined up recently during the referendum campaign to pay the headline rate.  However, we have made these points before and the Minister is not interested.</p>  <p>  The Minister has introduced meters on footpaths in front of people's houses to gouge money out of them.  As somebody said, it is a cash register on the pavement.  That money could have been used to address the 47% of water unaccounted for through leaks that we know exist.  This rate is very high.  I was a member of a local authority for 11 years, and the Acting Chairman was also a member.  Therefore, I note that some local authorities have made huge strides in reducing the rate to approximately 26%.  Some local authorities, particularly in Dublin because authorities there may have had funding from commercial rates, etc., were able to upgrade their networks.  There were some very simple steps taken.  Sometimes the simple steps are what work.  South Dublin County Council had a small team of inspectors going around at night listening for leaks with very simple equipment and fixing them.  The Minister does not need to stick a meter in front of everyone's house to do that, and he never did.  The Government should please stop pretending it has only discovered leaks through metering.  Instead of investing in meters to take money off people, the money should have been invested to fix the network.</p>  <p>  My other question, on funding, relates to how we will make up the rest of the &euro;1 billion that is needed for Irish Water and the impact on the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>This is a very apt and fair question on the day when 30,000 lone parents will have money literally stolen from their children's mouths.  What impact will this &euro;100 bribe have on the Department of Social Protection?  People are entitled to an answer.  What are the repercussions of getting this money for the Department of Social Protection in the context of this funding proposal?  Will the Department need extra staff?  The Government must get this &euro;100 into people's pockets before the election.  That is critical.  Will the Department need to take on extra staff to do it?  Will staff be diverted from elsewhere, for example, lone parents or applications for disability benefits?</p></speech>

Every Deputy in this House understands the pain and anguish suffered by people waiting for verification that they have been granted these allowances from representations we get.  Will people have to be diverted through paying the &euro;100 grant to bribe people to register for water charges?</p>  <p>  My last point concerns the local property tax and the local government fund.  I am not an accountant or an economist but I have a basic knowledge of finance.  I am still not clear whether the property tax is being used to fund Irish Water.  We know motor tax is being used.  It is not the case that 100% of property tax goes to local authorities.  Some of it goes into a central fund.  It appears that money from that central fund is being used to fund Irish Water.  If that is the case, it is a deception perpetrated by this Government which pushed the property tax as a way of funding local authorities.  The Minister of State needs to clarify this.</p>  <p>  The other issue is the way councils have been put in a bind.  We have all seen at annual budget meetings, because of the funding mechanism which the Government has changed, with some given to Irish water, the way councillors are put in a position where they are trying to decrease the property tax but by doing so they are cutting the amount of money they have for their own councils.  The way this Government has handled the funding of local authorities and Irish Water has to be defended.  Councillors are being told that they will make people homeless if they do not vote for increased property taxes.  Next we will hear that there is no money for Irish Water if people do not increase the property tax.  All of this has to be defended and explained by the Minister of State and he has not made any attempt to do so.  We still do not have a transcript of his speech last night that we asked for, which I do not think is unreasonable.  By the looks of it, there are only about four of us here who give a damn so he could have got four copies printed and handed to us so we could at least scrutinise what he said.  I would appreciate if that was done.  Perhaps we could take a break in the same way we had to take a break yesterday.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that a Bill I have been seeking for a considerable period of time is back in the House because unlike previous speakers, I think there is a lot in this Bill that means an awful lot in terms of the creation of badly needed employment, including in my constituency.  From that perspective, I welcome the fact that the Bill is now on Report Stage.</p>  <p>  In respect of the amendment, if one accepts that water services were heretofore funded out of the local government fund, one must accept the fact that in establishing any kind of new utility or shared service, there is a requirement to transfer that portion of the local government fund that was ring-fenced up to now for the provision of water to the utility that will provide water.  That is a very basic understanding and I find it difficult to understand why somebody cannot grasp the concept that if the local government fund is being used to provide a water service under the existing structure of local authorities and that function is no longer with the local authority, the funding stream should follow.  An awful lot of people would be belly-aching in here if this was not the case.  If a service was transferred from another Department or local authority into a new agency and the required level of funding did not follow, I am sure people would be hopping up and down in here.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley was very articulate in summing up his opposition to the water conservation grant as it is currently constructed.  In my constituency, and I am sure that of Deputy Stanley, a huge number of people pay for their water and have done so for years.</p></speech>

A huge number of people pay for their water.  The reason they do so is because if they did not come together as a group of citizens and provide a water service for themselves, nobody would do it for them.  On the previous occasion we discussed water services, I said that there seems to be a wish among some Deputies to maintain apartheid in respect of people who live in rural locations who are deprived of basic services and must provide those services for themselves.  I am speaking about the provision of water and refuse services, which were dismantled primarily because of a campaign that was led unsuccessfully by people who led the population up to the top of the hill, told them not to pay their refuse charges, abandoned them and then wondered how the service got privatised.  Certain people must contribute to their own road maintenance through local improvement schemes and community improvement schemes because if they do not do it, nobody else will do it for them.  I am sure the Acting Chairman is aware of this in his own constituency.  This involves a group of ordinary decent Irish citizens.  Deputy Higgins uses the phrase "ordinary working people".  Ordinary working people live in rural communities as well and they are sick to the back teeth of listening to people give out about the fact that they are finally going to get something from a Government in terms of the provision of their water.</p></speech>

In these cases, a person must buy an ultra-violet light to kill the bacteria that is flowing into the water they might use to make bottles for a young child.  They might have to take a shower or have the audacity to have to wash their clothes, which some people in here might have a difficulty with.</p><p>The reality is that rural dwellers do that entirely at their own expense.  Up to now, nobody on the Opposition benches has ever mentioned them.  The only thing those on the Opposition benches have mentioned is that they do not want them to get anything.  They do not want them to get the &euro;100 grant and for a lot of people, such as pensioners living alone who have wells, pensioners who are members of group water schemes where their water could cost anything over a couple of hundred euro, this is a significant amount of money.  The only query I have had about it in my constituency is when will people physically see the &euro;100 because for the first time the State has recognised that something needs to be done for them.</p> <p> I listened attentively to the remarks of the Deputies opposite and I fail to understand what they have against people in rural communities.  There was a time when one of the Deputies opposite wanted to have a referendum on Irish Water.  He wanted to put Irish Water into the Constitution but he would not put the aquifers or the infrastructure into the Constitution. The people who are currently providing their own water in homes, towns and villages are people living in Outer Mongolia, these are people in many cases who are living on the outskirts of regional towns and cities across the country who have no choice but to provide their own water.  Those people have registered in large numbers because they have come to me saying they have had to pay for their water by way of a group water scheme where they have had to make the initial capital investment, engage engineers, do the planning applications, manage it with the local authorities, install meters and where volunteers read meters.  Water meters are not a new construct arriving out of Saturn tomorrow morning, they have been in rural Ireland for a long time and people have had them read for a long time.</p> <p> However, all of a sudden, because we are going to make a level playing field and because we are going to ask everybody to make a contribution for the provision of water, some people have an issue with that.  They believe that  because one is living in a rural location and because the State never bothered to provide a service to those rural dwellers - probably the only service they are provided with is the delivery of post - and because rural dwellers have never been provided with a water service or a sewer and they have had to provide their own septic tanks and by accident of birth they live in a rural location.  Some members of the Opposition will parade around the country looking for votes, members of Deputy Stanley's party and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's party and everyone else.  Will they say to those people that because they are on a rural water scheme and because they have a septic tank and a well, they are second class citizens and they do not deserve the &euro;100 grant?  They will not.  They will be mealy-mouthed about it by saying they are not really in favour of the &euro;100 grant but will help fill out the form all the same.  they will send out the leaflets when the legislation passes.  That is as sure as night follows day.  Deputy Stanley probably has the leaflet organised already to drop it around places like Mountmellick and the outskirts of Portlaoise and everywhere like that, with the message, "Don't forget to claim your &euro;100 off Alan Kelly".  Perhaps Deputy Stanley will do what he should do-----</p></speech>

However, in my part of the country that is not the way things work.  In my part of the country, people go out and form a group water scheme, they bore their own well and they provide their own water.  What could be wrong with any Government that brings in a scheme for the first time in the history of the State that says to those people it values what they have done for their families, children and communities and that for the first time they will get a very small amount of money.  The only thing I will be saying to the Minister is that this should be an ongoing scheme given the costs involved in group water schemes.  The  Minister of State in his own part of the Comeragh mountains and places like that and in his experience as a member of Waterford County Council will be acutely aware that this is a real issue.  For the first time in my membership of a local authority for eight years and as a Member of this House since 2011, I have seen real progress being made in a very short period of time with regard to the delivery of water services in my part of the country.  We have had a disparate carry-on for long enough whereby it was everybody's problem, bar the people who were responsible for it.  Finally, somebody has said that enough is enough.  We must look to future investment in job creation.  We must ensure that communities are not closed down as happened in Galway city when it was exposed to cryptospiridium for months on end-----</p></speech>

He was a member of Laois County Council and knows what it is like for people to have wells that are contaminated.  As I do every week, I am sure he fills out forms for people looking for water softeners, for iron to be withdrawn from wells, for UV lamps to be bought and for pumps to be replaced.  He knows exactly what it is like.  From going into farmyards he knows the costs people have in terms of water for washing down a bulk tank and a meter down the end of the laneway with a standing charge from Laois County Council because they are regarded as commercial users.  He knows exactly what it is to dispose of that water.  He knows the difficulties farmers have had for years with this.  He knows the environmental protection regulations to which farmers must adhere.</p>  <p>  His attack on this &euro;100 is the one thing that disappoints me.  In my time on a local authority I spent much time with Deputy Stanley through the Local Authority Members Association and other things.  I know his heart is very much in rural communities, as is mine.  Why would he be against this?  I can understand why the other two Deputies would be against it because they are against everything that goes on in the country.</p></speech>

Every time a pipe is broken between the water meter at the end of the laneway and the bulk tank in the farmyard, that meter is still spinning around.  Deputy Coppinger wants to shove up the price of water for commercial users - the farmers and the people in the small shops.  That is her solution.  Every time there is a broken pipe and someone has to come out, it must be paid for.  This is only a small contribution towards that cost.</p>  <p>  When someone digs up a part of a concrete yard in a farm, detects a leak, fixes it, and makes sure there is no leakage into the ground, that is an example of a water conservation element.  So is harvesting the water from the roof of a shed that might be able to be used for washing a yard, but that also has to be paid for.  I am surprised that Deputy Stanley thinks that one can walk into a hardware shop in Portlaoise or Tullamore, walk out with a barrel and say that one will not pay for it at all.  In some utopian state a water conservation grant might not be needed, but we do because all those things have to be paid for.  All those water harvesting solutions we are being encouraged to use to wash farmyards need to be paid for.  This sum of money is only a small amount that is needed for that.</p>  <p>  I say to the Minister of State that there should be a review of this within 12 to 18 months to see if it can be even further enhanced.  I refer back to the old age pensioner living in Feohanagh in County Limerick, who has been on a group water scheme all her life because the alternative is to go half a mile down to the Deel.  If it were not for a group water scheme established under the former parish priest in that community, Fr. Hudner, those people would be still left travelling to rivers or drilling their own wells.  Perhaps Deputy Coppinger wants that and feels that people living outside the M50 do not deserve a water supply.  In my estimation, those people are no different from the people who live in her constituency.  I have a huge problem with this constant attack on farmers and rural people being launched by those two Deputies who want to blame them for everything.</p></speech>

This is long overdue, probably 50 years overdue.  Many people became secretaries of group water schemes and went to knock on their neighbours' doors to ask for small contributions to dig the road, to get the road opening licence and to lay the pipework with voluntary labour because the local authorities could not afford it because they were not properly funded and were all over the place in the delivery of water services.  That is what we have come to.</p>  <p>  I have no difficulty in saying I want to see this enhanced even more into the future.  Deputy Niall Collins, who has just come into the Chamber, will agree with me.  The people I represent deserve some sort of recognition for the costs associated with the delivery of their water.  Why would we not give it to them?  Why do the three Deputies opposite have such a problem with people who live in rural locations getting this?</p></speech>

I welcome the Government's decision to give people something back.  I welcome that the water conservation grant will do a small amount in terms of enhancing those people's positions in the delivery of water services on which they have been failed by local authorities under successive governments.  This is not unique to this Government; it has been going on since the foundation of the State.  For people who lived out in the country it was tough.  They had two choices: provide their own water or go to the river, so I welcome that.</p>  <p>  On the overall funding element I revert back to my original point.  If we accept that a certain portion of the local government fund was always used for the delivery of water services how can there be any difficulty in accepting that that money should continue to follow the service?  That is exactly what the Government is doing with this provision in the Bill.  It is a responsible local service provision being supplemented by local authorities through the State for the delivery of a safe potable drinking water supply regardless of whether people live in Mulhuddart or Feohanagh.  It ill behoves the Deputies opposite to be against giving rural people something for the first time ever, particularly someone as rooted in rural Ireland as Deputy Stanley is.</p></speech>

I want to make it clear to the House that 100% of the local property tax is being provided to the local authorities with 0% of the local property tax going to Irish Water.  I stated that on numerous occasions in the House yesterday evening when the Deputy was present in the House.  I am stating it again.  It is not accurate in any way to say that the local property tax is being used to fund Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The great irony of Opposition Members at the moment is that they are opposed to the subvention.  This is the very subvention that is assisting in making the funding model of Irish Water affordable for people.  This is the subvention that is providing for the children's water allowance.  This is the subvention that is providing for the capped charge.  They are opposing something that is assisting the citizens they are purporting to represent.</p>  <p>  The amendment simply allows for an amount of up to &euro;540 million to be made available from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  This is reflecting a budgetary decision that was well flagged with the publication of the 2015 Revised Estimates, which have already been debated and passed by the House.  This provision simply gives the legal underpinning to that budgetary decision.</p>  <p>  It is very disappointing to hear Sinn F&eacute;in opposing the conservation grant that assists rural dwellers.  The grant assists people who have been paying for their water over many years, including people drilling their own wells, maintaining their own pumps and maintaining their own septic tank systems.  In fairness, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have supported the conservation grant.  It is very disappointing to hear Sinn F&eacute;in oppose it in the House.</p>  <p>  The Government supports the amendment which is a simple measure to transfer funds to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

Yesterday saw the callous cut to the one-parent family payment, which will affect 30,000 single parents and their children.  Despite being warned that this is a counterproductive policy that will hurt many, the Government has ploughed on with it.  This is against the backdrop of the highest number of homeless families ever recorded, with 1,038 children from 490 families being housed in hotels across Dublin alone.  The number of homeless families is increasing month on month, despite the Government&rsquo;s stating it is taking urgent action.  Government policies are, unfortunately, making the housing crisis worse, instead of better.  The Government has been good on rhetoric and in stating its vision, but it is not taking enough practical decisions to allow families to stay in their homes.  Only two of the six banks have passed on reductions in mortgage rates, yet the Government refuses to take any real action to ensure relief for mortgage paying families.  Its refusal to increase rent supplement adds to the increasing problems of families who find themselves without a home.  The housing charity, Simon, recently surveyed 1,150 properties available to rent in Dublin and found that only 12% were available within the rent supplement cap limits.  As a result, housing authorities are allocating emergency accommodation in hotels for families who cannot rent properties.  For the first time, families are presenting to the Housing First agency which accommodates rough sleepers.  This week Focus Ireland again called on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to intervene urgently.  By refusing to address the rent supplement caps which have become totally disconnected from the rental market, the Government is standing over a vicious circle for the families affected.  Will the T&aacute;naiste agree to increase the rent supplement caps to help address this problem?</p></speech>

It must come as a relief to everybody in this House that, thankfully, what has happened to people in Greece is not a threat here because in this economy we have had a managed process of recovery.  The Deputy also referred to the one-parent family payment.  I do not think there is such a thing as a one-parent family payment.</p></speech>

This is the third year of the changes.  For Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s information, because it will apply to many of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents - perhaps he should inform himself on the issue - this year we have had contact with approximately 25,000 parents on a continuing basis, in individual and group interviews, in all Intreo offices, to open up services to lone parents.  Already since February 1,250 lone parents have transitioned to family income supplement, which boosts their family income significantly.  I want the Deputy to be aware of this because I am quite sure many of his constituents have benefited directly from it. </p>  <p>  We have a huge issue in building and providing extra units, apartments and houses around the country.  The Government has allocated unprecedented levels of funding, from the funds generated by recovery and people going back to work, to building, leasing and renting houses and the transfer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  As in the case of lone parents, when we set up and established 60 new Intreo offices, we moved from the Department of Social Protection simply paying money to people to it having individual interaction with people.  I sat down with the most senior people in Simon who came to see me less than a month ago at my invitation in my offices for pre-budget discussions.  They told me about their concerns about housing, housing allocations and homelessness.  They also told me that they were particularly pleased that the one-to-one service had seen more than 2,000 cases countrywide of people who were worried about rent increases to negotiate the rent on a one-by-one basis with landlords.  This was done through the sustainment protocol in operation with Simon and other organisations such as Threshold.  That is the way we are approaching the problem.  The Deputy should be aware of this.  We have rolled out the protocol around the country through the community welfare offices, as requested.</p></speech>

My question to her was if she would agree to revise and increase the rent allowance cap which she had introduced.  She proceeded to preach to me on a number of fronts, but she has avoided answering the question.  The unfortunate reality is that in 2012 she reduced the rent allowance cap.  She told us she was reducing it to reflect rental market considerations.  In the past three years rents have increased by between 20% and 30%, yet today and in the past few months the T&aacute;naiste has refused to amend the rent cap allowances to reflect current market conditions.  Instead, she tells us that individual families who cannot find a home within the rent allowance caps should try to deal with the problem on a one-to-one basis and go cap in hand to plead their case with their local authority and the landlord.  Those in receipt of rent allowance are not a tool for the T&aacute;naiste to try to affect the rental market.  They are people who need housing in the same way as anyone else and who are more dependent and vulnerable than anyone else.  It is unacceptable for the T&aacute;naiste to oversee a situation where in many parts of the country people who need to find a home cannot do so within the rent allowance caps.  Whenever the situation changes, the rules need to change.  That was the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s stance in 2012 and there is no reason she should not now take the same approach.  She cannot continue to stand over this situation.  The problem of homelessness is growing day by day and it is owing to a lack of action by the T&aacute;naiste that it is continueing.  Will she agree to revise the rent allowance caps in the next few weeks to ensure this crisis can be addressed?</p></speech>

This is the eighth successive cut she has inflicted on lone-parent families.  The vast majority of these parents, as she knows, are women.  Many are in low-paid and insecure jobs, many more are living in or at risk of poverty, and all struggle to raise their children in challenging circumstances.</p>  <p>  In 2012, the T&aacute;naiste promised that this cut was dependent on "there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries".  She said very definitively that without affordable and accessible child care, "the measure will not proceed".  The average cost of child care is currently &euro;167 a week, and higher again in Dublin.  In many communities, child care is just not available.  When Fianna F&aacute;il cut child benefit, the T&aacute;naiste said this was anti-woman and her party said it highlighted the lack of influence of women in Cabinet.  Yet, here we are, with Deputy Burton in government and second in command, introducing a measure that is both anti-woman and anti-child.</p>  <p>  Why has the T&aacute;naiste broken her solemn commitment that, in the absence of accessible and affordable child care, she would not introduce this cut?  Will she, even at this late stage, reverse this cruel and unjust decision to push thousands of one-parent families into poverty?</p></speech>

I am glad that parties in this House should actually want to debate how, as a country, we help lone parents to move from a situation where, if they are relying on a social welfare income, they are seriously at risk of poverty.  In 2003 and 2004, at the height of the Celtic tiger and Fianna F&aacute;il's rule in this country, lone parents were at a risk of poverty of somewhere between 30% and 33%.  Changes in policy mean that has now gone down to 23% because, since we instituted this change over two years ago - this is the third year of the change - lone parents' risk of being in consistent poverty has reduced.  It is a very high figure at 23% but, during Fianna F&aacute;il's high years, it had been at 30% and 33%, ten points higher.  If a lone parent is not working, their risk of poverty is over 40% but, if they are at work, particularly if they have family income supplement, their risk of consistent poverty falls below 10%.  I find the 10% unacceptable but I find it infinitely better than either the 33% of Fianna F&aacute;il or the current rate this Government has achieved, and which the Deputy's party spokesperson on social welfare spoke about in his speech the day before yesterday.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear on what the objective of this Government is.  It is to get a group of people parenting with their children on their own to a situation where their risk and experience of poverty is dramatically reduced.  We have done that, as the Deputy well knows from the information she has from the Department, by creating a transition period of over seven years to a lone parent returning to work.  That is in recognition, as I told the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman, of the fact we in Ireland do not at this point in time have the kind of child care system to which I certainly aspire.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach seems content that all is well, but I know many people who think otherwise.  The T&aacute;naiste is an accountant and might have more concerns than the Taoiseach.  There have been disturbing allegations around the largest ever sale of property in the history of the island of Ireland.  The Northern Ireland loan portfolio, Project Eagle, involving more than 850 properties with a par value of &euro;4.5 billion, was sold to US private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for less than &euro;1.5 billion, a surprise winner of the tender.</p>  <p>  In June 2012, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Mr. Sammy Wilson MLA, NAMA reappointed Mr. Frank Cushnahan and Mr. Brian Rowntree to the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  Two weeks later, a report by a Northern Ireland auditor's office seriously questioned the stewardship of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which led to the resignation of Brian Rowntree and Frank Cushnahan.  The report found breaches of housing executive guidelines in the sale of at least 27 land deals, the executive board being given wrong or no information relating to key property deals, favoured property speculators were allowed to buy land well under market value, expressions of interest from other parties not being declared or considered, and at times no reasons being offered for some off-market sales.</p>  <p>  These two individuals stayed in NAMA, one of them up until the summer of 2014.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think this was a good idea?  Back in 2009, the T&aacute;naiste proposed an oversight committee for NAMA, with the purpose of informing the public about what is happening in NAMA.  In the past four and a half years, has the T&aacute;naiste at any time considered putting that idea forward again?  Given this has not been done, does the T&aacute;naiste believe now is the time for a serious look at how NAMA operates?  We need an independent inquiry to see if the interests of the taxpayers have always been the top priority for NAMA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200020#S01700"><p>I am not familiar with the details of the particular case the Deputy outlined.  The issue of the oversight of NAMA and proper procedures is important because NAMA was, in effect, a kind of bad bank for the explosion that happened in the Irish property market when construction and the financing of it fell apart.</p>  <p>  In regard to the arrangements made for NAMA, I suggest that if the Deputy has not already done so, he should submit a detailed question such as this to the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether any of these questions have been raised with NAMA or whether the Deputy has raised his concerns with NAMA.  However, as the Deputy knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General has oversight of NAMA and closely oversees the work it does.  When the arrangements regarding NAMA and the banks, following the collapse of the banks, were established, a decision made by the previous Government was followed by the current Government.  That decision was that the governance and organisation of NAMA's affairs would not be run directly out of the Civil Service and, in particular, would not be run directly by politicians.  I believe this was the correct decision and that it is better that it is run as a business.</p>  <p>  NAMA was also set up with a specific legal structure which was debated at length in the House.  This was further strengthened by the current Government in the context of oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the Deputy knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports directly to the Committee of Public Accounts, of which a member of the Opposition is Chairman and at which members of all groups and parties are represented.  Any issues concerning NAMA are significant, but I do not have a direct answer for the specific query raised by the Deputy.  The structure of oversight and governance, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, seem the right avenue through which to address the issue. </p>  <p>  I suggest the Deputy should get one of the Technical Group's representatives on the committee to raise the issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the committee wishes, it should then examine the issue.  In previous cases regarding issues arising in organisations, that mechanism has worked well.</p></speech>

There have been three special reports on NAMA's activities by the Comptroller and Auditor General and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing what is a very complex business.  I regret that NAMA ever had to exist and that good builders such as Deputy Wallace and the people who worked for him ended up in the crash that followed losing a huge amount of employment and a huge amount of money, but that is what happened when the economy was run into a brick wall.  It is very difficult to give a definitive answer on the recovery value of anything which previously had a certain value and which lost its value following the crash.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done a series of reports on NAMA.  I am not clear on whether Deputy Wallace is basically saying he does not accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports.</p></speech>

We have often agreed to late sittings where there are matters of importance or emerging legislation that merit that, but we will not agree to a late sitting this evening which has the express purpose of continuing the sham with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The choreography and cynicism that have been demonstrated by the Government is apparent to everyone at this stage.  The Government is clearly abusing its position in the manner of ordering the business of this House to ramrod legislation through the House that will have very serious consequences and implications for people who are struggling to get by, as the Government continues to insist on its unjust and unjustifiable water charges.</p>  <p>  I note in a later proposal the Government also intends to guillotine that same piece of legislation.

The normal procedure of the D&aacute;il has been abused in terms of the way the Government has approached the Environment (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill.  The reason for tonight's late sitting is because the Government has been trying to sneak in amendments on Report Stage instead of ensuring they were dealt with on previous Stages of the Bill or, as was proposed yesterday, that the Bill would have been recommitted to Committee Stage.  Instead, the Government is seeking that the House would sit late to suit its agenda of trying to ensure that such issues are not debated and that the Opposition would not get a proper chance to address them and table amendments.  For that reason, we will oppose the proposal for a late sitting.</p>  <p>  We hear much rhetoric about having a family-friendly D&aacute;il but situations such as this, which the Government creates, whereby the D&aacute;il sits until 10.30 p.m. do not in any way contribute to ensuring that this is an attractive place for people to work.</p><p>The Government is suiting its own purposes, driving legislation through the D&aacute;il and not ensuring the democratic mandate we all have is exercised by ensuring there is proper debate.</p></speech>

Yesterday, several hours of debate were spent on one point.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, flagged it to the Opposition, well in advance, she made it very clear that additional amendments would be introduced.  A debate on it and on the Long Title of the Bill took place, as required.  The Government, in allocating nine hours of debate today, is seeking to provide the kind of time for debate which the Opposition Deputies indicated yesterday that they desired.  I am surprised the Opposition Members, who were clamouring for an amount of time to debate the legislation, do not seem to want it now.</p></speech>

The Government will need a flexible interpretation of the law if it wants to explain why this Bill can be used as a vehicle to force landlords to inform Irish Water who is renting their properties, make it compulsory that charges be paid prior to the sale of a house, include in tenancy agreements an obligation to pay the Irish Water tax and make local authorities the enforcers of the tax.  It is a bit of a stretch by any standard to include these matters in the Bill.  This is just the latest episode in which the Government has demonstrated not only contempt for the D&aacute;il, which we could probably stomach, but also utter contempt for the citizens outside this House.  Several months ago I asked the T&aacute;naiste to show her hand on the penalties being cooked up for people who were unable to or would not pay these unfair water charges.</p></speech>

These issues have been stored until now, so that they could be included in legislation dealing with dog breeding, dog licences and Killarney National Park.</p><p>This is all in an effort to railroad this legislation through just before the summer in the vain hope that they will get away with it because people will be distracted, will go off on their holidays and will forget all about it.

It is bad enough that the Government has had eight months since last November to introduce this legislation, but it has also left it until just before the summer recess to shove it in.  In addition, the debate will be guillotined at 9 o'clock tonight, with the effect that many Government amendments will not be discussed.  The measures include new leases for tenants who constitute a very vulnerable group in our society with the housing crisis, given that the Government is not building any houses.  Other measures include landlords handing over information.  It is clear to me that the T&aacute;naiste does not want Members to discuss this.</p></speech>

The Government is proposing we have a gimmick D&aacute;il day, with no Order of Business, no Leaders' Questions and no votes.  That is simply unacceptable and is not the way this Parliament should operate.  Unfortunately, it is representative of the way the Government treats legislation and we will not accept it.  This legislation should be postponed until next week to deal with it appropriately on a proper day.  Alternatively, there should be a full D&aacute;il sitting tomorrow, like today and any normal sitting.  We will oppose this proposal.</p></speech>

There were no heads of a Bill and there was no pre-legislative stage.  The convention of having a two-week gap between each Stage has gone out of the window because that does not suit the Government.  What suits it is to bring this legislation forward, shut down or minimise debate and get it done and dusted in order that Government party Members can go off with their buckets and spades and to hell with the people-----</p></speech>

The Government should respect the conventions such as the two-week gap.  Why does the Government not do that?  It is because it is politically inconvenient and it wants it done and dusted in the vain hope that people will forget, the summer will intervene and the Government will get away with it.  It will not get away with this and it should not get away with such clear contempt for parliamentary procedures.</p></speech>

It is clear the Government does not want a real debate but is happy that the media uses the legislation in that way.  The legislation is quite toothless and will not be able to deal with a mass boycott of water charges.  It might be able to deal with a television licence not being paid but it will not be able to deal with the hundreds of thousands who will not pay the water charges.  It would be better to have a debate on this on a normal day when people would be present for both the debate and the vote.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200026#Y00300"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend, consolidate and extend the law relating to coroners, coroners' investigations and coroners' inquests, to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as <i>an tSeirbh&iacute;s Chr&oacute;in&eacute;ara </i>or, in the English language, the Coroner Service, to define its functions, to provide for certain transitional matters including the completion of inquests commenced under the Coroners Act 1962, the transfer of certain documents preserved under the Coroners Act 1962 to the Coroner Service and the continuance in use of certain forms under that Act, to repeal certain enactments and provisions of enactments, to amend certain enactments and to provide for related matters.</blockquote>This legislation originates from a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Justice and Equality to seek an automatic inquest in the case of every maternal death in the State.  This issue comes on the back of eight inquests into maternal deaths between 2007 and 2013 which returned verdicts of medical misadventure.  The bereaved families did not receive these verdicts in internal inquiries and investigations carried out by the hospitals involved; they had to fight tooth and nail for the inquests to be carried out.  </p><p>The response I received to the parliamentary question was that the issue was being considered as part of the consideration of the Coroners Bill, 2007.  That would be grand, except that that Bill was initiated eight years ago.  It is worth pointing out that it arose from recommendations made by the coroners review group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003.  The reviews recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the Coroner Service, including the legislation governing the work of coroners and the support services available to them.  In 2013 the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, told us that he hoped to be in a position to progress the Bill, but here we are in 2015 and not there yet.  </p><p>The reason I am pushing this legislation is it is absolutely and urgently needed.  It is largely the 2007 Bill with the addition of a provision to provide for an automatic inquest in cases of maternal deaths.  It is urgently needed given the experiences of the families of the women who tragically died during childbirth in the past few years.  Tania McCabe, Evelyn Flanagan, Jennifer Crean, Bimbo Onanuga, Dhara Kivlehan, Nora Hyland, Savita Halappanavar and Sally Rowlette all died as a result of medical misadventure.  A total of 14 children lost their mothers, yet the bereaved families had to fight to get that verdict.  </p><p>Why is a verdict important?  It is important not just to give the families closure but also to help prevent future deaths.  It is an absolute necessity.  The partner of Bimbo Onanuga had to fight for three years to have an inquest carried out which finally explained to him what had happened in her tragic death.  There are examples of coroners declining to recommend the holding of an inquest in the case of a maternal death only to grant one at a later stage, with the inquest returning a verdict of medical misadventure.  This issue is hugely important.  In the case of Dhara Kivlehan who died in 2010 in a complicated cross-Border case, it took huge pressure on the part of her husband and legal wrangling with the HSE to have an inquest carried out into his wife's death.  He was disrupted in his efforts at every stage, but the inquest helped.  Tragically, the lack of an automatic inquest in that case possibly contributed to the failure by Sligo Regional Hospital and the HSE to learn vital lessons which might have prevented the death of Sally Rowlette from the same condition in the same hospital in 2013.  It should be remembered that she left behind four children.</p><p> It is not good enough for the Government to decide it can leave legislation, which was initiated for seven or eight years ago, and take the view that it is not urgent.  It is very urgent for pregnant women in hospitals in this State.  It is up to the Government, the Ministers with responsibility for health and justice and the HSE to ensure that women who are giving birth in Irish hospitals receive the highest quality of care.  Sometimes things go wrong.  Tragically, that is part of life.  However, when things do go wrong, it should be admitted, owned up to, acted upon and learned from to ensure other families do not go through the same tragic experiences.  Providing for an automatic inquest in these cases is the one sure guarantee of that.</p></speech>

It has been alluded to that in some way this amendment relates to the financing of Irish Water.  It does not.  That is not what this amendment is about in any way, shape or form.  The amendment simply allows an amount of up to &euro;540 million to be made available from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  This is reflected in a budgetary decision.  It has been well-flagged with the publication of the Revised Estimates and the 2015 Estimates and has already been debated.  The provision simply gives the legal underpinning to that budgetary decision.  It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  For the benefit of the Deputies I will explain the figures again.  Page 160 of the Revised Estimate Volume sets out the forecast income and expenditure of the local government fund in 2015.  The main elements of the forecast of &euro;1.84 billion in revenue are made up of gross motor tax receipts of &euro;1.167 billion and &euro;440 million in the local property tax.  The matching expenditure is &euro;1.84 billion.  This is made up of &euro;459 million provided to local authorities as the LPT contribution, demonstrating that 100% of LPT is provided to local authorities.  A total of &euro;364 million is provided to roads and transportation payments, &euro;399 million is forecast for an Irish Water subvention and &euro;484 million as a proposed payment to the Exchequer.  This is what this amendment is about.  It is about nothing else.  The amendment refers to the payment to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

The Government did not cut the schemes, it has done away with them.  The local improvement schemes served to help people living in rural areas who wanted to roll up their sleeves.  I have dealt with many of these people over the years and I continue to deal with them.  They are good hard-working people.  The Government cut these schemes, it axed them.  It did away with the local improvement schemes.  Now, people in rural areas who are willing to help improve the roads in their own area cannot even get grant assistance.  Then, the Government cut the home help hours, which affected elderly people in rural areas.  It removed the community welfare officers.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is running out of the Chamber because he does not like hearing the truth.</p></speech>

I am surprised at Fine Gael.</p>  <p>  Turning to water supplies in rural areas, the Government has caught many people with this.  These people are the so-called Irish Water customers and have an Irish Water meter outside their front door.  I have seen many of them in recent months.  There are many of them in rural areas.  The Government has caught all these rural dwellers, which Deputy O'Donovan claims to be so concerned about, into the Irish Water net.  People in rural areas who are on wells and group water schemes see the carrot of the water conservation grant for what it is, a carrot.  That is why many of them who have their own septic tanks have not applied for it.  Those people see what is coming.</p>  <p>  For the record, during the debate on the septic tank legislation I pressed the then Minister, Commissioner Hogan, in the Chamber and outside in respect of the need to change the group sewerage schemes, improve the grant level and bring it up to at least the level of the group water scheme grant.  He did that and I gave him credit for doing so.  Deputy O'Donovan said that this is the first time in the history of the State that the State has given grants to people in rural areas.  This shows how ignorant he is about what has been happening previously in this country.  Grants have been available to sink and improve wells for as long as I can remember, and rightly so.</p>  <p>  If the Government has an extra &euro;130 million floating about that it can take from social protection I would prefer to see it being used in the best way possible.  Rather than give it to people who do not need to save a drop of water, the Government could use part of it for well grants for people in rural areas or to improve the subvention to the group water schemes, which should continue.  These are the facts.  We believe the Government should put the money into real conservation measures or use it to fix some of the leaks.  Can the Minister imagine what some of the county councils could do with &euro;130 million?  Imagine if those on Tipperary County Council heard tomorrow morning that under service level agreements they would have an extra &euro;130 million or even &euro;10 million to fix leaks around Nenagh or Borrisokane?  What if the same applied to Laois County Council for Mountmellick or Rathdowney?  Let us consider the improvements they could make given the results they can produce with &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  That is what should happen to reduce the amount of leaks.  The Government could use some of the money to improve the grant scheme for wells and the subvention for group water schemes.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Donovan did not know that but then again he did what he always does.  He ran into the Chamber, spoke for everyone in the Chamber and assumed everyone's position for them.</p></speech>

Imagine a Fine Gael Deputy for a rural constituency not knowing the basic facts regarding the availability of those grants.</p>  <p>  The problem with the &euro;540 million is that the Government is doing what was done in previous years.  It does not matter which way the Government turns, it is taking money from the Exchequer.  Twice already in this debate - I will not do it a third time - I have outlined the amount of money the Government is taking out of the Exchequer and loading onto the State's balance sheet to prop up the godforsaken entity that is Irish Water.  The Government is sucking away &euro;540 million from the motor tax to fill the hole left which is propping up the entity called Irish Water.  That is what is happening.  I advise the Minister not to proceed with this amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is at the front of that campaign of the Labour Party.  The only problem the Government side has is that what is being said is not true.  Deputy O'Donovan spoke of repeated attacks by Deputy Ruth Coppinger and me on farmers and the rural community.  I challenge Deputy O'Donovan, if he is in his office watching the debate, to return to the Chamber and back up his statement with references to the transcript of the D&aacute;il, media reports or any forum in which we have attacked any people who do not live in major cities.  It is a nonsense.  It has never been the case.  Admittedly, we attack the financial system and the troika.  At times, we criticise harshly big businesses and big corporations.  At times, perhaps, we criticise big farmers but we do not make a point criticising or condemning those who do not live in cities.  By contrast, we consider ourselves their allies.</p>  <p>  In my constituency, Dublin South-West, there is a not insignificant number of people who are not connected to the mains and who have wells or are part of a group water scheme.  I have met many of them who say they support the campaign against water charges.  They are opposed to the cut in the subvention to the group water schemes that has gone hand in hand with the water charges.  They are opposed to the turning of water into a commodity and to the process of privatising the water system.  They favour having free, quality public water supplied to all.  That is our position.</p>  <p>  The Government has admitted in the course of this debate that everyone has paid for water through motor taxation and other means.  We are not saying those people who are not connected to a public water system should have to pay twice while those who are connected should pay only once, through motor tax.  We are saying no one should pay.  Through a mechanism of sufficient grants and infrastructural investment in and expansion of the public water system, no one should have to pay twice, regardless of where he or she lives.  It is without basis for the Government side, including Deputy O'Donovan, to present this as a matter of an urban-rural divide.  In fact, we have a classic case of divide and rule.  There is an attempt to set ordinary people against one another based on where they live, just as the divide-and-rule principle has operated in the past through differentiating between people based on whether they worked in the public or private sector.</p>  <p>  Let me refer to some of the points the Minister made.  I welcome his contribution and presence because he may be able to shed light on some of the issues for us.  He referred to the fact that this legislation effectively has nothing to do with Irish Water and that the money is a sum being transferred from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  That is fine and we understand that but we are clearly of the belief that this is step one of a two-step process.  Step one involves the transfer from the local government fund to the Exchequer, and step two involves a transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water.  Does the second step simply not exist?  Will there be no transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water?  Will the transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water, presuming there is one, be of the same magnitude as the one from the local government fund to the Exchequer?  Is it, therefore, the case that there is effectively one transaction involving a transfer from the local government fund to Irish Water, but with the middleman, the Exchequer, in between?</p>  <p>  In my previous contribution, I raised a number of points on the amendments Deputy Ruth Coppinger, Deputy Higgins and I have tabled, namely, the amendments to amendment No. 20.  None of these points has been dealt with or referred to in any way, never mind answered, by the Minister of State.  Therefore, I hope the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will be able to do so.</p>  <p>  Our first amendment to amendment No. 20 reads: "In the third line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), to delete &ldquo;or more than one,&rdquo;."  The Government's proposed paragraph (a) reads: "Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015, pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance."  Our amendment would delete "or more than one" so only one transfer could be made.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the point to having one sum transferred.  It would be in the interests of transparency and clarity as everyone would know how much is involved on the completion of the transfer.  Why does the Government not accept that amendment?</p>  <p>  Our second amendment, which we believe is more important, is more to the point.  Again, the Government has not given any reason it will not accept it.  It is a very simple, democratic addition to the relevant paragraph.  It reads: "In the fourth line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas"."  That would change &ldquo;payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; to &ldquo;payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That is very simply a democratic check on the Minister for Finance.  If we need any evidence that the democratic check is necessary, we need only note how Committee Stage has been avoided and the way in which a new water charges Bill has been rammed straight through via another Bill on completely unrelated matters.  We clearly need a check on the Minister for Finance.  The amendment makes a very simple, democratic demand, namely, that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have to approve any transfer from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  It is entirely reasonable and democratic for us to ask that this demand be inserted in the Bill.</p>  <p>  Of course, with the respect of the Government for the European establishment it regards as its ally, democracy is fairly low down the priority list.  One need only look at the attempted regime change that is currently taking place in Greece, with Ms Angela Merkel at the head but with the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, happy to play along.</p>  <p>  Let me refer to our third amendment and clarify a point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised earlier.  The amendment reads: "In the second line of paragraph (c), proposed to be inserted by section 42(b), to delete &ldquo;&euro;540 million&rdquo; and substitute "&euro;1"."  It is not to substitute &euro;1 million but &euro;1 for &euro;540 million.  The reason is that the Government has not given any justification for the amount of money being transferred.  We believe it is being transferred to feed the beast that is Irish Water.  We oppose the section and the Bill as a whole because of what will be in it.  As a step in the right direction, we propose to reduce the amount of money from &euro;540 million to &euro;1.  That would limit the transfer amount to an amount that is much more reasonable.</p>  <p>  The Government side has not addressed the amendments and has not outlined why they should not be accepted.  In particular, I press home the basic democratic argument concerning the need for the transfer to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas as opposed to just giving a blank cheque of a little more than &euro;500 million to the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

I had a number of committee meetings to attend.  I hope what I am asking in respect of this group of amendments has not been asked previously by another contributor.  The amendments to amendment No. 20 have just been mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy.  I have not had the time we normally have to consider amendments properly and determine how they fit in with the overall intent of a Bill.  That was stated earlier on the Order of Business and I will not repeat what was said.  Normally as Whip, I take the time to consider amendments to try to inform myself, my party and the party spokesperson and to determine whether we can amend the legislation, if required, in order to keep it in line with our party policy.</p><p>I do not have that luxury, which one would have in the case of a normal Bill, because the Minister has produced a brand new Bill.  I am not sure whether some of this has been dealt with, but from what I can gather, the amendments facilitate the transfer of &euro;540 million from the motor tax fund to Irish Water.  Originally, such funds went towards the cost of fixing all roads in a county.  Thereafter, they were used to supplement the subvention paid by the State to local authorities such that motor tax became a local government tax used to fund water services and whatever other service local authorities looked after.  If we were to tell someone from any other country in the world that we had to pay motor tax and that the funds went to a company that had nothing to do the roads, he or she would find it bizarre.  At &euro;540 million, the payment is huge.  Perhaps I am a little foolish, but I thought that if there was extra money available from motor tax receipts, it would be spent on plugging the potholes that were appearing not only in rural Ireland but also in Dublin city.  We see far more potholes because of the failure to fully fund local authorities.  </p> <p> It is also very convenient that the figure nearly corresponds with the stated cost of installing water meters.  I am told that the figure was not arrived at in this way, but I find it very odd that it is a way of funding the new corporate monster that Irish Water has become.  In the past, when the moneys went to local authorities, they were spent in a more efficient manner because we did not have the new high costs associated with Irish Water, including set-up costs such as the cost of installing of meters and establishing call centres.  I find it strange.  </p> <p> The householder is not only being asked to pay domestic water charges, as part of a series of bills designed to facilitate the introduction of a company known as Irish Water, he or she is also being asked to pay commercial water charges because companies pass on costs incurred to the consumer.  There is also the State subvention, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, in the long term, the borrowings of Irish Water which will be passed on to householders in time.  Despite the fact that the Government has set water charges at a certain level, they will increase in the future because it has set up Irish Water as a commercial company that must become efficient.  If it has the desired effect and people pay in the way the Government wants them to pay, water charges will increase.  </p> <p> The Government has left a hole in the local government fund.  It is interesting that the Minister mentioned this, in some ways, out of the blue, even though I was trying to see whether there was any mention of it in his opening remark in terms of how the money was to be spent and who would benefit.  There would be a benefit in leaving it in the funds in terms of making local authorities more efficient and investing properly in new technologies to help deal with pollution and renew the supply for Dublin city, an issue I have mentioned here on a number of occasions and a supply which is continually endangered by the failure of the Government to invest in a renewal or a restoration of the tunnel on the Vartry river to the Dublin supply network.  The Government is to allow a private company to borrow.  Therefore, it will be paying not only the initial cost but also the extra cost involved, rather than investing directly, as requested by many local authorities.  I know that local authorities have continually asked central government for additional moneys to plug holes in the system to make it more efficient, but they have been starved of funding, which is one of the reasons motor tax receipts are being used fo fund water services.  </p> <p> What is the position on VAT?  Is a portion of VAT receipts being used for water conservation purposes?  Are all VAT receipts going to the Exchequer?  One of the reasons for the increase in the rate of VAT was to deal with a problem that had been identified because of the lack of investment in the water network in which the leakage rate was 50% or more.  Apparently, Irish Water will do the devil and all and it will not cost consumers anything for a few years.  However, a huge bill will then land on their doorsteps because Irish Water will borrow to do all of this work and consumers will pay not once, twice or three times but possibly four times.  There is a problem with the figures the Minister is coming up with and his intentions, as we still do not know the full extent of the cost involved.  How many times will the customers of Irish Water have to pay?  Will it just be a single payment or will they have to pay continuously through various other mechanisms such as the State subvention, paying for the borrowings of the company or through the passing on by companies of increases in commercial water rates?  At the end of the day, their customers are the Irish people.  How many more times does the Government intend to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund to keep this corporate monster afloat?</p></speech>

The water conservation grant is very welcome in rural Ireland and I am sure the Deputy is well aware of this across counties Laois and Tipperary and everywhere esle.  Many hundreds of thousands in group water schemes and with wells will have the opportunity to use the grant to service their wells or invest in technologies to bring water to their homes or buy water butts, for example.  The Deputy may be aware that the grant has stimulated thoughts about the development of a range of new products and services which people will purchase.  People are now more aware of the need for the conservation of water, which is surely a good development.  Deputies of all hues talk about the need to conserve water.  I have met a number of people who are defining technologies and services which they believe must be made available throughout Ireland.  The grant has been welcomed across the country and it will help to motivate people to think about technology and services they will use to conserve water.  It is not just customers of Irish Water who are thinking along these lines but also those in group schemes.  They have been the unsung heroes for many years when it comes to the professionalisation of water services.  I met representatives of group scheme operators on a number of occasions.  I also meet them organically in my work and they have consistently shown that water supplied through group schemes is of a high standard, which is credit to the dedication, work and effort of such schemes across the country.  Some of the finest water is to be found in very large schemes, which has been the case for many generations.</p>  <p>  The water conservation grant has been well received, particularly so in rural Ireland and by group schemes on the basis that they are being treated in the same way as everyone else, which is as it should be because they have been paying for water for many decades.  People living in rural areas know the value of water, the value of the technology used and the effort it takes to get clean water into their houses.  They know that it does not just appear out of the tap all of a sudden, that infrastructure has to be created for it to be supplied.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputies opposite will welcome this fantastic document which was put together by the food industry in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and a number of agencies working hand in hand from an environmental perspective with my Department.  It is a strategy that will absolutely grow the food industry hugely, to a level we have not seen before.  It will help to create 23,000 jobs which will be totally dependent on the supply of good, clean water.  All jobs in the food industry are completely dependent on the supply of good quality water.  I did not see anyone at the launch today which was attended by very many people who had an issue with the Government water strategy's.  They understand and respect the fact that we have to pay for infrastructure because if we do not have it in place, we will not be able to create these jobs and will not be able to support food production in rural areas.  They were happy about the fact that I, as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and those who would come after me would be in a position to provide water for their industry to ensure it would be protected and could recycle itself.  In 2025 there will be a requirement for a new strategy to ensure even further economic development.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned that there was an attempt to divide and rule.</p><p>I wonder if Deputy Murphy has ever visited County Roscommon.  Has he ever seen what those people have gone through?  I have visited it many time, I was there this week and I was also there three weeks ago.

There is a big division when tens of thousands of people in a county have boil-water notices because of lack of investment in infrastructure.  The people in County Roscommon do not see, necessarily from an intensity point of view, the same thing happen in many urban areas around the country.  Those people deserve to be supported.  That is why we have worked towards ensuring that thousands of them no longer have boil-water notices and are now getting what they absolutely deserve.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley also made reference to the rural water groups.  Subsidies and grants have always been given to the rural water groups to address deficiencies in their schemes even though, as the Deputy is well aware, the schemes are very well run.  I acknowledge he has said that on a number of occasions.  There are some good schemes not far from where he lives and where I live.  I met members of those rural water groups on a number of occasions.  They have looked for a multiannual programme of funding so that they can plan ahead, a request to which I have acceded.</p></speech>

The answer is &quot;No&quot;.  I have read into the record of the House exactly what is happening here, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey.  This is simply an amendment to allow for this payment to the Exchequer.  There is no seeing around corners.  There is no second step.  This is simply as it is stated.  There can be a level of paranoia around certain things, but there is no need for it on this occasion.  The amendment is to give legal force to a budgetary position set out in the Estimates.  From a transparency point of view it must be remembered that the accounts of the local government fund are published annually and are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  So this is fully transparent.</p><p>The Deputies opposite have questioned on numerous occasions the issue of LPT.  The LPT fund that is being put together is paid straight out to local authorities.  That has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>in here and the figures have been produced as well.  So there is no hole in the local government fund.  The amendment is simply as stated, to make a payment to the Exchequer.  It has already been flagged on numerous occasions.  There is no possibility of any second step, which Deputy Paul Murphy suggested.  This is exactly as stated.  I propose that the amendment be accepted.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 5 is also a technical amendment to provide for the collective citation of the proposed Part 8 of this Bill and the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2014.</p><p>Amendment No. 21 amends the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 by inserting a new provision, section 23A, into the 2013 Act.  This section introduces a legal requirement on the owner of a dwelling either to register with Irish Water as the customer or to notify Irish Water that they are not the occupier of the dwelling.  Where the owner is not the occupier of the dwelling, the owner shall be required to notify Irish Water of the name of each person with whom they have an agreement to occupy the dwelling and the date of commencement of any agreement.  This provision would not apply where the customer details have already been provided to Irish Water before the proposed legislation comes into effect.  This would mean there will be no additional requirements for customers who have already registered with Irish Water as part of its customer registration campaign.</p><p>This is an important provision to ensure that Irish Water is made aware of the person responsible for the payment of water charges in accordance with the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  The section provides that where the owner of a dwelling does not provide the necessary information to Irish Water within 20 days of the legislation coming into operation, or within 20 days following any change of occupation, then the owner shall be liable for any charges payable to Irish Water until such time as they provide Irish Water with the necessary information.  The provision of false information to Irish Water shall be an offence.</p><p>The section also provides that any agreement to occupy a dwelling which commences after the provisions come into effect, unless it expressly provides otherwise, shall be deemed to include a provision that the occupier is liable for any charges to Irish Water.  Any tenant whose tenancy is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act will be responsible for the payment of water charges.  This is in line with the principle that the user pays, as defined in the Water Services Acts, and will ensure that tenants are eligible for the water conservation grant.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 is a technical amendment.  It provides for the amendment of sections 9 and 10 of the Water Services Act 2007, relating to the prosecution of offences, to take account of the offence provisions introduced by amendment No. 21, which deals with the requirement to register with Irish Water.</p><p>Finally, I would like to address Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's amendment No. 11 to Government amendment No. 21.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's amendment proposes that the provisions outlined in the proposed section 23A be subject to review by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in regard to its impact on tenancy termination.</p><p>It is important to note that this section does not put a new obligation on tenants.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 defines the customer as the "occupier" of the property.  As such, the tenant is already liable for the charges.  It is a standard term and practice in residential leases that tenants should pay their utility bills, which would include water bills.  Accordingly, there is no basis to predict that a landlord would seek to evict tenants for not paying their water bill over and above the non-payment of any other bill.  In any event, tenants continue to have the same rights and protections under the PRTB process provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act, which must be gone through prior to any evictions.  It should noted that evictions are generally sought where there is non-payment of rent or anti-social behaviour.</p> <p> I do not see the Government's amendment having in any way, shape or form any adverse impact on the number of evictions sought.  Accordingly, I will not be accepting the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200034#GG00200"><p>I am very concerned about amendment No. 21 because in it the Minister is effectively turning landlords into enforcers and the landlord will be responsible for ensuring this money is paid.  This would include local authorities and voluntary housing associations, because it applies to the owner of the house.  In the case of a local authority, the owner is the local council and in the case of a voluntary housing association the owner would be Respond, Cl&uacute;id or S.T.E.E.R or a similar organisation.</p>  <p>  My greatest concern is for the tens of thousands of people on a low income who are renting privately.  About this time last year, around the time the Minister took up his position, we addressed the issue of the position of the Private Residential Tenancies Board in both the committee and this House.  The PRTB was a positive step forward because it put something in place where we had nothing, but it only had a staff of 31 or 32.  This made it very difficult to take a case through, hard to get the PRTB to take on the case and difficult to get it completed.  This is no fault of the staff there.  There are two main problems.  First, the existing legislation is extremely weak in regard to tenants' rights, although there are also difficulties for landlords and, second is the lack of resources available to the PRTB.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned that we already have people who are becoming homeless.  A typical situation is that a landlord wants to raise the rent, perhaps from &euro;500 a month to &euro;600 or &euro;700 a month, but he cannot raise the rent for the sitting tenant within 12 months of the previous increase.  What happens therefore is that the landlord serves notice on the tenant and the tenant has to move out.  If there is any hangover of a utility bill, that is deducted from the deposit.  I have frequently come across a situation, and this is what gives rise to my concern regarding this amendment, where the landlord will withhold some or all of the deposit for damage.  That might be justified sometimes, but much of the time it is not and the deposit is being retained for wear and tear.  The landlord will retain the deposit and use it to redecorate.  The problem in this regard is that the tenant has no way to raise another deposit for new accommodation.</p>  <p>  I having been dealing with the case of a girl named Edel.  She is stuck in private rented accommodation, but she cannot get a tenancy agreement or rent book from her landlord.  She is a very vulnerable person and the best I can come up with for her to show the local authority she is renting the place is to get her to keep the lodgment receipt from the bank showing she is lodging money in the landlord's account.  She should be on the housing waiting list and I will try to get her onto the local authority list in the next few weeks.  This girl has serious disabilities and a traumatic past.  I would not even try to describe a quarter of what she has gone through.  What she has been put through is horrendous.  She is from the Minister's county originally.</p>  <p>  This woman is not on the waiting list and is unable, therefore, to get rent allowance.  She is living on &euro;86 a week and her electricity was cut off the other day.  I raise this matter in the context of this amendment.  The electricity account was in the name of the previous tenant and because Edel cannot show she is now the tenant, she cannot get the account transferred to her name.  I have not been able to do that either.  She has no electricity, no rent allowance and has just &euro;86 a week left after lodging &euro;100 a week to the bank for her rent.  She is living on fast food and some of her neighbours are helping her.  This is a difficult and appalling position to be in.</p>  <p>  If this amendment goes through, it will cause another problem for her and many like her.  The media often mentions how common renting is throughout Europe, from housing trusts and other groups.  That is fine and dandy for them, because there is nothing unusual for people in Germany or Holland to be in the same private rented apartment or house for most of their lifetime.  However, it is a different story here.  It is like a mill churning, how quickly rental properties are turned over here.  Several tenants could occupy the same house over the period of a year here for various reasons.</p>  <p>  If, for example, Irish Water charges by the quarter, in the first quarter some tenant might leave the house on 1 March without having paid for the first quarter.  The landlord will not want to pay that bill.  Therefore, we will have a situation where, for example, Joe Bloggs leaves the house without paying and then Mary Bloggs comes in as the next tenant at the start of the second quarter.  She will end up carrying the bill for the first quarter, because that is what is happening in the case of electricity.  That is what this amendment will allow.  The landlord will not take on the shortfall.  If Mary Bloggs does not pay, when she goes to leave the apartment or when, six or 12 months down the line, the landlord decides to raise the rent and she cannot pay the new rent, she will be caught in situation where part of her deposit will be withheld to pay the charge to Irish Water.  This is a serious problem.</p>  <p>  I see the Minister shaking his head, but I can see no other way for this to work.  The fact is the different pay periods for the bills will not always correlate with the length of people's tenancies.  This is only one of the problems and I can think of ten more.  Will the Minister provide an answer in his response regarding the case of the girl I mentioned who has to produce her receipt from the bank into which she pays her rent?  I am aware this is a separate issue, but I would like to hear the Minister's response to it.  She is very vulnerable and should be on the housing waiting list.</p>  <p>  If a water bill is carried on to the new tenancy, the new tenant will feel hard done by and may not be able to afford to pay it.  The people most affected by this will be the people on low wages who are not on rent allowance or people on rent allowance who may be on social welfare.  Those worst affected will be people like the unfortunate person I have mentioned who is on social welfare but is not on rent allowance because of a technicality or because the landlord will not comply.</p><p>She cannot rent anywhere else.  The Bill presents a new set of problems for her, in addition to her existing problems.  If the changes are introduced they will lead to major conflict, pressures and tensions and add to the problems that exist already between some landlords and tenants.</p> <p> Tenants in this country do not have fixity of tenure.  The Land League sought a fair rent, fixity of tenure and the right to buy.  Land was the issue 130 or 140 years ago but we are still talking about the same issue in connection with housing.  People do not have any guarantee when it comes to tenure and there is no sign of it coming in the near future.  There was talk last year of beefing up the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and perhaps doubling the staff to 60 because the private rented sector has expanded and it is now a major player in terms of housing provision.  People have different views on that.  My view is that we are overly reliant on the private rented sector.  A new problem has landed on the doorstep.  The measure under discussion will especially cause problems for multi-unit complexes, but it will also cause problems in the case of single housing units within developments, in particular for people on low income.</p> <p> We had a debate in recent days about one-parent families.  I know many such families.  The Government has hit those lone parents who are working part time, who cannot get 19 hours work per week.  If they get 19 hours then they can resort to family income supplement, FIS, payment to support them.  Many lone parents are in private rented accommodation and they will be affected by the measures contained in the Bill.  The situation will be very difficult for them.</p> <p> Housing issues comprise the majority of cases in constituency clinics and they are also the most difficult ones that arise.  That is the case in my neck of the woods anyway.</p></speech>

One does not know where to send people.  Tenants will be in a difficult position because the landlord is the enforcer and he or she will lean on the tenant.  The responsibility will be carried over from one tenancy to another.  I have seen it happen with electricity bills and other utility bills such as gas.  The situation could give rise to all types of problems.  The meters have not come into effect yet.  If a stand-alone house with an address of No. 1 Bridge Street is rented out, when the meter is in use, what will happen if a tenant moves out in the middle of March?  It is unlikely that Irish Water will send someone to read one meter.  What will happen in such a case?  Then a dispute could arise over how many gallons of water had been used at the point at which the tenant left.  There is no provision for a new tenant to read the meter.  At least with electricity meters a person can open the box housing the meter with a little triangular key and read the meter but that is not the case with water meters.  I cannot read the meter and tenants in private rented accommodation will not be able to read them.  The situation will cause havoc in the private rented sector.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.594" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1197" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200035#HH00400"><p>With this set of amendments, in particular Amendment No. 21, we are getting to the heart of the Government&rsquo;s way of doing business, and why it is in effect ramming a new legislation through an existing Bill that has nothing to do with water charges.  The approach can be summed up in the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;.  The Bill is about scaremongering and using certain tactics to push up the levels of payment, by targeting people who are more vulnerable, partly as a result of the actions and lack of action on the part of the Government and previous Governments in terms of security of tenure for those who are renting.  The intention is to target them and attempt to force them or scare them into paying.  Of course the Government has learned from the best.  It is a pale reflection of the kind of bullying and terror being inflicted on the Greek people at the moment in an attempt to get them to vote in the way that the European establishment would like them to vote.</p>  <p>  In the first case, it is clearly discriminatory.  It adds a second obligation on tenants to pay the water charges.  One could ask why that is necessary.  Everybody is meant to pay the water charges.  It is the law that we must do so.  There is a significant campaign encouraging people not to pay, of which I am part.  I am not paying my water charges and I encourage others not to do so but everybody is already subject to the law which says people have to pay water charges, so why discriminate against tenants relative to homeowners and give them an extra obligation to pay?  What is the justification for that discrimination against tenants?</p>  <p>  Why is the measure needed?  If people were paying the water charges, would the measure have been introduced?  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has joined us in the Chamber only in the past couple of hours for the debate.</p></speech>

They were forced to occupy South Dublin County Council because they could not get any emergency accommodation that was suitable considering that Alan had 50% custody of his son, and they had been sleeping in a tent.  It was a disastrous situation which is illustrative of the broader problem and crisis we have in housing and that makes it especially disgusting that the Government would now go after tenants in terms of trying to bully them into paying water charges.</p>  <p>  That owners are being obliged to register or to hand over the name of their tenants is also discriminatory and unnecessary.  Corresponding obligations do not exist to the same level for home owners.  I also object to the fine of up to &euro;5,000 for filling in false information in a registration form.</p>  <p>  It is clear that what is at issue is scaremongering.  That is the only explanation of the proposed measures.  I do not understand why the Government cannot accept Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v amendments Nos. 11 to 21.  It seems reasonable that the measure would be reviewed by the PRTB and a report made to the Oireachtas after one year.  However, I would also like to explore the matter and question the Minister on the reality of how the system will operate.</p><p>The Minister said scaremongering is occurring and has implied that those of us who are campaigning against the water charges are scaremongering.  We are not interested in scaremongering.  We want to explain the reality of it, which is less scary than some of the headlines that have been generated around it.  The Government is out to scaremonger to try to force people to pay.</p> <p> If a landlord hands over a tenant's name to Irish Water, which is now a legal obligation, and if the tenant declines to register or pay, there will be no negative consequences for the landlord's relationship with Irish Water.  Irish Water will not pursue a landlord for water charges, given that they are the legal responsibility of the tenant or occupier once the landlord has fulfilled the obligation to hand over the tenant's name.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this is the case.  If so, and if the Bill is enacted, tenants can clearly tell landlords that while they are obliged to hand over the tenant's name, the matter has nothing more to do with the landlord but is a matter between the tenant and Irish Water.</p> <p> A number of leases already specify that the tenant is required to pay all utility bills, which can include water charges.  There have been no cases of tenants who failed to pay water charges being evicted.  The fact it could happen is scary, discriminatory, bullying and wrong.  However, it has not happened.  There is no incentive for a landlord to evict a tenant for non-payment of the water charges given that non-payment would have no negative consequences for the landlord.  Tenants should not be intimidated, if the legislation passes, and think they have two obligations to pay the water charges, one to their landlords and one to Irish Water, and feel they have to do it.  Landlords will not evict tenants who do not pay water charges given that non-payment has no impact on landlords.  The legislation is not retrospective.  Those who have existing tenancy agreements that do not specify that people must pay water charges will not experience any change.  They would need to have a new tenancy agreement with a new or existing private landlord for it to come into effect and to insert an implied clause into the tenancy agreement about the need to pay water charges.</p> <p> I would like the Minister to clarify the following point.  When a landlord complies with the obligation to hand over a tenant's name, it removes responsibility from the landlord for the water charges bill.  Irish Water will send a bill in the tenant&rsquo;s name.  If the tenant does not pay, at the end of the lease when the tenant moves on, the bill follows the tenant.  If a tenant fails to pay an electricity bill that is in his or her name, and moves home, the landlord has nothing to do with it.  The electricity supplier continues to pursue the tenant, given that the bill is in his or her name.  If the bill is in the landlord&rsquo;s name, the landlord has the right to deduct it from the tenant&rsquo;s deposit.  The same applies in this case.  Under the legislation, landlords will not be empowered to deduct water charges from people&rsquo;s deposits.  The Minister has threatened more legislation that may empower them.  I will believe it when I see it.</p> <p> The amendment is outrageous, discriminatory, bullying and bad behaviour by the Government against tenants, the more vulnerable sections of society who are more susceptible to pressure, because of the housing crisis, responsibility for which lies with the private market and this and previous Governments.  However, we will do our best to debate it here and convince the Government by the strength of our argument to withdraw it.  If the Minister does not do so and if the Government uses its majority to get it through, tenants should not be scared or intimidated by it but stick to the boycott.  It is very unlikely that a question of eviction will arise and if it does, the landlord is legally obliged to specify the obligation to pay water charges in the lease.  People can leave it to that point, and it is very unlikely that many, if any, tenants would come to that point.  Tenants should not be intimidated but should have confidence over fear, stand up to the bullies and continue to boycott the water bills even if they are in council, private rented or housing association accommodation.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 21 requires all households to register as customers of Irish Water.  This is the only utility of which I am aware for which registration is a mandatory obligation.  For electricity, telephone services and other utilities there is a choice.  I understand why there is no choice in this instance, given that there can be only one water service.  However, there is a major lack of confidence.  A recent survey of organisations people distrusted put Irish Water at the top of the list.  It is a big ask for people to register with a body in which they have no confidence.  The lack of confidence exists for a number of reasons, not least the ham-fisted way the Government has gone about this, even for people who are in favour of water charges.</p>  <p>  At least two pieces of legislation were brought through the House in a very flawed way.  This is the third.  While the T&aacute;naiste and others can try to brazen it out, it is not the way to do business.  A flawed process very often leads to a flawed outcome.  If this message did not hit home in the first and second pieces of legislation, I wonder if it is hitting home in this, the third piece of legislation.  There is no evidence to suggest it is.</p>  <p>  Every household will be affected by the legislation.  Households in rented accommodation will be affected more often.  There is a higher level of renting now than in the past, which is set to continue given the changes in how mortgages are funded with higher deposits required which would be difficult for people provide.  Included in the announced changes in local authority housing provision is a high level of private sector rental accommodation, whether by leasing, rental accommodation scheme or housing associations, which will dominate this.</p><p>The PRTB already faces a significant workload.  I know of people who have been waiting longer than a year to recover deposits which were withheld erroneously.  This is the biggest element of its workload.  The PRTB will be taking on a more sizeable role in future given the changing nature of tenure.  It will be required to deal with even more complaints due to this amendment at a time when it is already creaking at the seams.  When we make this kind of change, it has the biggest impact on those who are most vulnerable to the housing market.  These include people who are already struggling to pay rent.  A withheld deposit or even a refusal by a previous landlord to provide a reference can make the difference in the efforts by individuals to secure accommodation.  There will be unintended consequences for the more vulnerable renters, who unfortunately are an increasing cohort of society due to the precarious nature of work.</p> <p> People are required to register with an entity in which they have no confidence.  There are many reasons why their confidence has been dented, not least of which is the Minister's attempt to differentiate between those who will not and those who cannot pay.  I have tried to find out what that means.  Part of the reason why people are fearful is because they believe the monumental amounts of money required to build a first class water system will result in significant increases in water charges.  Full cost recovery will put people in a parlous position.  They see an organisation that appears to offer generous rewards internally.  That is a significant problem.</p> <p> The water charges are not seen as being presented in an honest manner.  I accept that in parts of the country, including the place in which I live and represent, water supplies are on a knife edge.  We urgently need to persuade people to conserve water but this system was not designed with conservation in mind.  The nonsensical conservation grant gives the impression of conservation but we could save much more money if people were more responsible with their water usage.  The Government is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear with Irish Water.  The Government's attempts to force people into a position where they feel they are unable to criticise that organisations will do nothing to restore confidence in it.  The sooner the Government understands it has to go back to the drawing board, the better.</p></speech>

I am fascinated with amendment No. 21, which provides that a property owner must register the property if he or she is getting a service from Irish Water.  What this means in practice is that if the property is the owner's principal private dwelling, for some inexplicable reason the he or she will have to register with a company with whom he or she has no commercial connection if he or she wants to get the grant.  One the one hand the Minister says this will be done de facto but, on the other, he is not including it in the legislation.  There must be some reason why he is saying people kind of have to register their principal private residence if they want to get the lollipop from the Government given that the legislation does not require them to register.  This is indicative of the muddled thinking behind the legislation.</p>  <p>  It has become obvious over the last two days that a considerable number of ordinary decent people, particularly those on low incomes, will get caught in the middle of the stand off between the Minister and the Independent Deputies who are advising people not to pay.  These two macho groups are using the people with whom I work on a daily basis as pawns in a power game.  The Minister arbitrarily declared that if people do not register by 30 June they will not get the &euro;100 grant.  On Sunday night a lady on modest means informed me that she had not registered with Irish Water.</p><p>She was on a group water scheme and had a septic tank but because she had not registered with an agency she need not have any connection with, the Minister will take &euro;100 out of that widow's pocket.  Her daughter lives nearby and thankfully I managed to contact her also.  I told her that since she has a well and a septic tank, she does not have to pay.  She still has to register, however, otherwise there will be another &euro;100 out of her pocket.  Due to all this conflicting information, there are hundreds of thousands of people in this situation around the country.  Given the Government's attitude in setting an arbitrary deadline, they will miss out on the grant.  They set this ridiculous condition that a person must register even if they get nothing from Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p> The other situation concerns people who have been told not to pay and tough it out.  The Minister is saying that if a person has not registered by 30 June they will be &euro;100 down.  That applies to the most vulnerable people in our society who have been listening to the propaganda not to register.  The State is a patient operator and does not mind, as long as it knows the money will roll in the longer term.  </p> <p> According to the legislation, a person who has not paid bills for water and sewerage services for two years, will have passed the magic &euro;500 threshold.  They will be brought to court as a result and the fines can be attached to their income.  The Deputies behind me may say that the State cannot bring everybody to court.  However, my experience of the more vulnerable people in my constituency is that when legal letters start flying, they get worried.  They have never been to court in their lives and do not want to go there.  In addition, the court may be 40 or 50 miles away, so it represents a big cost for them to attend.  They will wind up paying nearly &euro;600 and will have lost &euro;200 in grants.  Most people will not escape the payment because they will not want to attend court.  </p> <p> The same applies to those who get caught for the &euro;200 household charge.  They will have to pay an extra &euro;100 whereas those who paid &euro;100 in the beginning got away with it.  I have yet to meet any of those who advised the public not to pay water charges, who are willing to put their hand in their pocket and pay for them.  I have not seen that happen.  The Minister's clever pincer movement catches people in a bind that they think they cannot get out of.  Ordinary citizens are more likely to pay, rather than go beyond a certain point.  The people who tell them not to pay, do not put their hands deep in their pockets to make up the difference.</p> <p> The Government is laying down rules that will penalise those who have not registered by the end of June.  In addition, there is a clever pincer movement on top of that to make sure the Minister gets his money one way or the other.  I know the syndrome that the Minister is depending on.  If, through all of these machinations, the Minister gets the compliance rate up to 80% or 85%, he is aware that no matter how reluctantly people paid, human nature being what it is, they will say, "Well, if I had to pay, I am damned if a whole lot of other people are going to get away without paying".   Therefore, even those who have protested against water charges, once they sign up and pay, many of them will change sides and say, "If I had to pay, why should everybody not pay".  </p> <p> The meanest element of the pincer movement is the significant cut that An T&aacute;naiste has made to the funding for exceptional discretionary payments for those who cannot pay water charges.  A community welfare officer explained to me that the social welfare system makes payments on a rote basis.  There is a series of rules, including means testing and payment of social insurance contributions.  However, a person's actual circumstances are not taken into account in terms of how poor they are or how many bills they have.  The means test does not count those things.</p> <p> In the past, a community welfare officer was able to make payments on a discretionary basis, which was hugely important.  They were able to make a case based on need, taking everything into account outside the terms of fixed schemes that are always quite rigid.  In that way, they were able to help people in poverty and financial distress in a way that the more formalised part of social welfare cannot do.  </p> <p> In many years of dealing with constituents, I have noticed that for one reason or another, two people with the same income and household profile, can find themselves in dramatically different circumstances.  I have dealt with people on low incomes but who have huge savings because they are careful.  Other people cannot handle money and are eternally in financial distress.  That is part of the human condition. </p> <p> One of the biggest percentage cuts in the T&aacute;naiste's budget has been made to discretionary payments by community welfare officers.  We are talking about making payments on a staged basis, but when a person has no money and their income does not meet their outgoings, it makes no difference whether they are asked to pay today or tomorrow.  </p> <p> When I was running the co-op, somebody came in to buy something.  I asked them if they wanted to pay now or put it on the account.  They said if they could not pay there and then it would be unlikely they would be able to pay, so they paid.  This idea of putting it on the never-never for those who are stuck for cash is utterly meaningless.  That is why the Bill does not hang together.</p><p>As a result of the way this has been handled, the least well-off will be the hardest hit.  The Minister knows that it is in the housing estates which ironically are the places where &euro;100 would most come in handy that the lowest number of households will gain from the largesse of the Department of Social Protection.  It would be fine if the Government was going to write off the obligation, but it is going to wait in the long grass for two years and leave a sword of Damocles hanging over these people until it comes after them for the money.  When it does this, I do not see any group that could make up the money for the people caught up in this macho war between the two warring sides.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to stop and rethink, to reflect on who is becoming the ham in the sandwich and recognise that what is happening will hurt a lot of people a few years down the road.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies in the Chamber were present to hear about it.  It is an amazing plan and I am sure the Deputy will be encouraged when he gets a chance to read the proposals put forward by the sector across the food production industry.</p>  <p>  There is nothing unfair about the provision in the amendment as it is about providing certainty and clarity for the person responsible for paying the bill.  There is nothing discriminatory about it as it is the user who pays.  I hope most people will agree that the user should pay.  We have already passed the Water Services Act which provides for the payment of water charges and this provision is to assist in the efficient administration of the charges.  It promotes the user pays principle with which I presume everyone agrees.  It also ensures tenants can obtain the conservation grant, which is critically important.  </p>  <p>  The existing legislation requires the occupier to pay.  A couple of Deputies made the point that somebody coming along after someone else would be liable for the bill if it was not paid, but that is not the case.</p><p>That is simply not the case and it is actually the total opposite.  Deputy Stanley should hold on and stop shaking his head.  Irish Water will have to deal with whoever was the previous occupier.  This gives obligations in that sense to the landlord.

Local authorities and voluntary housing bodies already have transferred information on tenants to Irish Water and this is covered by the existing legislation.  I wish to make that point.  Just in case anyone thinks otherwise, it would be an offence to provide incorrect information to Irish Water under this section, including an incorrect date or details.  Dispute resolution options are also available through the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  In respect of the matter raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in 2015 non-customers are required to inform Irish Water that they are not users of the service.

The Government realises the concerns of citizens about affordability of charges.  For this very reason, as the Deputies are well aware, legislation was prepared at the end of last year to cap water charges at &euro;160 for a one adult household and &euro;260 for multi-users.  The capped charges apply until the end of 2018 with provision for a further cap to be set by the Minister of the time, whoever he or she may be.  A free allowance provided for children and the provision of meters allows people to beat the cap.  It is quite clearly a conservation measure.</p>  <p>  All in all, this legislation and this amendment is far from discriminatory, as one or two Deputies described it.  This is actually bringing a large degree of certainty to the situation.  It is providing a certainty that will ensure tenants are treated fairly and it will also ensure that it is clearly defined who is responsible for paying the bill.</p></speech>

He has not dealt with the central issue raised by me.  On the issue concerning long-term and short-term tenancies, Deputy Paul Murphy made a point, on which I disagree with him, that it will not become an issue between landlords and tenants.  It will become an issue in private rental accommodation in many cases given the short-term nature of tenancies.  The issue will arise given the precarious and short-term nature of tenancies in this State.  We are not Germany or Holland.  We do not have people in rental housing belonging to housing trusts for life or perhaps ten, 20 or 30 years.  It is common, and I have come across it often, to have several different tenancies of a house within the one year.  A problem will arise.  The tenant of a local authority or a voluntary housing association will wind up pretty much in the same situation as an owner-occupier.  Joe Bloggs will rent from the local authority and the information will be passed on by the local authority to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The local authorities and the housing associations will have fulfilled their responsibilities in that case so it will be a matter between the tenant and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The local authority or the voluntary housing association will be caught in the middle.  Their obligation, as set out in the Minister's amendment, is to provide the information.  A failure to do so leads to a penalty and I am sure the voluntary housing bodies or the local authorities will not allow themselves to get into that situation.</p><p>Assuming the landlord complies with the requirement, a problem can arise if there is a dispute between them given the short-term nature of tenancies.  The problem will be between Irish Water and the tenant in private rented accommodation in many cases.  The Government has not dealt with the issue of the meter reading.  Perhaps I am not explaining it very well, but if tenant A is in a house and surrenders the tenancy or is served notice to quite because the landlord wants to increase the rent or says he is going to sell the house or whatever else, and tenant A moves out, there is only a 1 in 91 chance that there will be a correlation between the date the tenant moves out and the date of the meter reading because there are 365 days in the year and four quarterly bills.  There is only a 1 in 91 chance the dates will coincide.  If tenant A moves out on any of the other 90 days in the quarter, the problem will be that the meter will not have been read.  This is where a problem will arise and that is only one of the problems.  I know and the Minister knows and I have seen landlords doing this already with electricity bills - they will put unpaid bills onto the new tenancy.  I have given the advice to people going into private rented accommodation to photograph the meter on the day they enter the property.  The Minister is waving his hand at me but they cannot do that in the case of Uisce &Eacute;ireann because the meter is in the ground.  One cannot read the meter.  It is not possible to read the one outside my door.  This is where a problem will arise.  The problem also is that if the meter has not been read and it is not due to be read for another month or two months, tenant A who is moving out cannot pay the bill, which means he cannot get his deposit back, but he needs the deposit to move onto the next property.  In my neck of the woods, landlords were happy enough to take the equivalent of a months rent in advance as a deposit.  Now they are looking for both.  Now they are looking for &euro;1,800 or &euro;2,000 in some cases.  This is causing a problem.  This will cause an added problem.</p><p>The Minister referred to this in his speech yesterday.  He said: <blockquote>The Government reiterated its commitment in May to legislate in these areas, principally, regarding liability for domestic water charges and the process of registering with Irish Water and in particular, clarifying the registration process in respect of landlord-tenant relationships.  Today, I am fulfilling these commitments through the amendments proposed to water legislation.</blockquote></p><p>The Minister was referring to this legislation.  He went on to say that measures announced in May to place a requirement on a landlord to retain a tenant's deposit until the tenant provides evidence that he has paid the water charges would be brought forward shortly in a forthcoming Bill.  Which Bill is the Minister referring to?  He might set that out for the House.  We would be interested to know what Bill the Minister will use to bring forward that measure.</p> <p> This is the crux of it.  Can the Minister see what he is suggesting?  He refers to a tenant providing evidence.  Even if a tenant is willing to pay, how can he provide evidence if he does not have the evidence?  These people will be caught in a see-saw situation.  Let us make no mistake about it.  It does not matter which way the Minister tries to explain it.  I foresee legions of these people joining the legions of people who are already homeless.  The Minister heard this in County Laois on the day he was there.</p></speech>

A total of 91 households presented as homeless in the first 90 days of the council this year.  Laois has a relatively small council.  I had four people in my office last week who were experiencing different types of homelessness.  Two came in on the Monday.  They are going to add to the numbers because of the hangover of bills, the confusion and the lack of evidence available to a tenant to show he has paid it.</p>  <p>  The Minister is missing another point.  Many landlords have put in prepaid meters.  It is not a bad system.  A tenant can go to a local pay point in a local shop and get &euro;10 or &euro;20 worth of credit and put that credit into the gas or electricity meter, just as a person does with a mobile telephone.  When it runs out, the person can go over by &euro;10.  That is useful.  It is a good help for people.  The most a landlord is ever left with is a &euro;10 hangover of the bill.  There is no great dispute and world war three does not open up over it.  The problem in this case is those involved do not have the means to read the meter.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will not dispatch meter readings here, there and yonder for the benefit of landlords.  I realise there is electronic means of reading them but the company is not going to do it and it is not easy to contact.</p>  <p>  The operation has been taken away from the local authorities.  When the local authorities ran the call centres, it was easy.  A person could ring up the local authority and ask for the water services section.  The man or woman at the other end of the telephone would know where the person was living and could identify the area.  The person contacted by the call centre person in turn would know this information as well.  This is different territory and I see difficulties arising with it already.  I hear councillors talking about it, even councillors from the Minister's party.  It is not as easy now as it was previously.  This situation will create another muddle.  In the middle of that muddle will be the casualties, the private rental tenants stuck in revolving door tenancies.  These people are moved on in a matter of a few months because landlords do not want people staying in tenancies for long given the nature of tenancy and rent legislation.  The Minister has not brought in rent caps.  He has talked about it again lately and we are getting near election time.</p></speech>

All this is on top of the crosses that people are already carrying.  It amounts to a crucifixion of people in the private rented sector.  The multitude of problems that people have to deal with already is more than enough.  We hear about it from them daily.  I lived in private rented accommodation at different times in my life.  Depending on who the landlord was, it was not so easy.  People are vulnerable.  The Minister knows and I know that as the demand for housing grows, the hand of the landlord is strengthened.  That is a fact.  The hand of the tenant is weakened and the tenant has few cards in his hand.  In fact they are stripped bare.  This will drive many tenants under and make it impossible for them to secure new accommodation.  The problem arises in that gap between a tenant either surrendering a tenancy or the tenancy being ended by the landlord and the period when the unfortunate tenant is trying to move on to another tenancy.  He will not have the deposit or the cash back.  I see what many landlords are doing, although not all of them.</p>  <p>  The Government promised another thing last year.  This was discussed at length in the committee.  The Government gave the impression that it would put in place some kind of mechanism to deal with deposit retention.  That would be welcome and it is urgently needed.</p></speech>

One suggestion was that it could be put into an account.  We would not get much interest on it at the moment, but the interest on the account could fund the operation.  I am unsure whether we could do that at the moment.  The fund could lend the money to Irish Water, because Irish Water is paying 3% on borrowings.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

There is an absence of strong legislation to improve the lot of tenants and provide for long-term and more secure tenancies.  There is an absence with regard to what I had thought the Minister would do in respect of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  None of us wants to see bloated quangos, but the PRTB has a staff of 30 or 31 and cannot be counted as a bloated quango.  It is grossly understaffed.  The creation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board was positive.  The 2004 Act is generally positive in that it sets out the rules.</p></speech>

However, it is not used and has not always been satisfactory.  The big problem is the delay.  It can take a year or two years for a case to get through the door, get under way and for progress to be made.  That is too long.  Sometimes within a year or 18 months the tenant in question may have moved two or three times.  It is chaotic.  In the case of a dispute over a tenancy 18 months ago, we may as well forget about it, move on and take the loss at that stage.  In the absence of beefing up the Private Residential Tenancies Board and changing legislation for more long-term and secure tenancies in this country, the Government should not proceed.  I maintain the Government should not proceed with this in any event, but to proceed with it in the current circumstances is lunacy.</p>  <p>  The Minister or whoever comes after him will be dealing with the problems of increased numbers of homeless.  The health service is the most important thing in the State.  It is about life and death.  The next most important thing is housing.  Last Christmas, the Minister put homelessness at the top of his agenda and the Opposition parties rode in behind him.  Some short-term measures were put in place.</p></speech>

They were not enough but they were welcome.  Any improvement is welcome.  The problem is that a roof over people's heads is the next most important thing.  We have to try to get people away.  Numerous people are attending general practitioner surgeries suffering from mental health issues that are exacerbated by two issues.  The first is a shortage of money and the second is the insecure nature of their accommodation.  I know one woman on the housing waiting list.  She is now housed with a voluntary housing association.  She has a condition called agoraphobia.  The fact she was on a waiting list and in insecure accommodation aggravated her condition and caused her more problems.  That is another issue that will compound the problems from which vulnerable tenants suffer.  This will catch people between moving out of a tenancy or losing a tenancy and their ability to get somewhere else.</p><p>Organisations such as the Simon Community will wind up mopping up big problems.</p></speech>

There are three steps he could have taken to make their position somewhat safer, but he never bothered with them.  </p>  <p>  A previous speaker raised the issue rent controls.  I became a Member one year ago, but many before me had been asking the Minister - I am sorry for boring him - to introduce rent controls to try to stop the escalation in the level of homelessness.  He is setting up a commission - the proverbial commission - to look into it.  Meanwhile, the level of homelessness has increased by 800%.  What has the Minister done?  He has introduced a provision such as this to make private tenants even more vulnerable and insecure.  We all know what he is doing; he is trying to drive up the payment figures for Irish Water.  He is bringing in this law to try to frighten people and hopes the payment figures will go up by the time he releases the information, if ever.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister must be aware from his civil servants that the number of private tenancies has escalated.  Since he took office, the number has increased by 52%.  In December 2013 there were approximately 450,000 private tenants.  There are now almost 700,000 because the Minister is forcing an increasingly large number of people into the private rental sector.  Therefore, the provision in the Bill is really important.  I want to send a message to people who are privately renting that they should not worry or be bullied by what the Minister is introducing today.  I will explain why.  Owners of properties - landlords - must give information on who is occupying their homes to Irish Water.  I was asked by somebody this afternoon whether the Minister could clarify the legalities regarding data and privacy, about which people are very concerned.  I would really like an answer to that question.  What I have said means that if owners do not provide the data, they will be liable for the charge.  If they do provide them, they are not liable and the person named as the occupier becomes liable.  That actually gives tenants the ability to take part in the mass boycott of the water charges, which is what my provisions are aimed at, without being put under severe pressure by landlords.  Landlords must give the information to Irish Water, which means that they will no longer be liable.  The charge is applied to the home of an owner, but if the owner can prove he or she is not liable, he or she does not have to pay.  Therefore, tenants can say and should be able to say to the landlord that it is a matter between them and Irish Water.  Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, some landlords are using whatever lame excuse they can to evict tenants.  He needs to clarify today in a very serious way whether tenants will be evicted on these grounds as a result of the legislation he is shoving through on a Thursday before the summer recess without any serious Committee Stage debate taking place.  It is important that he do so because I believe I heard him say in his initial speech that it was not the case.  He has a duty, as Minister, to reassure tenants.</p>  <p>  Tenants should not feel intimidated by this measure.  They should say to their landlord that the question of whether they pay Irish Water is a matter between them and Irish Water and that it is none of the landlord's concern.  The Minister agrees with this.  I am glad that we are in agreement on at least something today, which is a first.  What the Minister is trying to do is use this legislation to panic the living daylights out of people whom he knows are very vulnerable to get them to rush out and pay.  People have contacted my office to say their landlord has already raised this issue with them.  The measure cannot be invoked, as the Minister knows, because it is not now included in one's tenancy agreement.  It will be, or can be, included in a new tenancy agreement.  For most tenants, rents are rocketing and an Irish Water bill is the very last bill on their mind.  In Dublin, in particular, rents have increased by &euro;100 per week.  In Cork, Galway and elsewhere they have also increased.  Somebody said today that he or she did not know anything about what was occurring beyond the M50.  In Galway city 38% of people are reliant on the private rental sector.  In Cork the figure is 28% and in Dublin, 25%.  If one adds to these figures the figures for council and housing association tenants, one will realise they, collectively, comprise a very significant section of the population.  The much-heard clich&eacute; that it is in Irish DNA to own one's own home has been shattered since the Government came to power.  It is not actually building homes or allowing people to gain access to credit from the banking system.  Therefore, an increasing number must rely on private landlords.  It is critical that we send the message that people should not be intimidated by this measure and that landlords should not be using it.</p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to clarify whether the plan to steal from tenants' deposits which they should be getting back will be implemented before the summer.  There are only a couple of weeks left, but, given the way things are going, the Minister will probably bring in a new set of Bills in a couple of days.  Will it be invoked very soon?</p>  <p>  One cannot be evicted for not paying water charges.  If the Minister agrees, I would appreciate it if he could get this message out also.  If people are worried, I implore them to consult an information leaflet that others and I have drafted.  They can go to the Anti-Austerity Alliance, its Facebook page or website and get the leaflet.  It is a leaflet for tenants arising from the Government's new water charges legislation.  They should boycott the water charges until after the general election.  It is really important that we have very high non-payment figures to persuade a future Government to abolish the odious Irish Water and also the water charges.</p>  <p>  Given the increase in rent supplement and the Minister's steadfast refusal to introduce any legislation to allow people to gain access to increased rent supplement, for example, the introduction of a measure such as this is despicable.  The Minister is adding to people's stress.  When will the Government introduce "rent certainty", as the Minister called it, rather than rent controls?  When will it introduce such measure?</p>  <p>  The third thing that is needed in the private rental sector is an absolute end to repossessions by banks in order to sell houses on the open market.  People should be allowed to stay in their properties and continue to rent them, rather than landing on the street, sleeping in cars and ending up in hotels, if they are "lucky", at huge cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>If the Minister is going to make it more likely that landlords will evict people for not paying water charges, would he at least consider asking NAMA to do something?  NAMA owns 12% of the hotels in this country, none of which are in use for homeless people but could be used.  Is that not something to which the Minister should turn his attention?  </p> <p> Amendment No. 21 makes it compulsory to register.  Would the Minister recognise that by obliging people to register with Irish Water within 20 days of this Bill being passed, he is admitting defeat?  He claims that 70% of people have registered but, of course, we have not been able to examine that figure because many of the people who have registered are not Irish Water customers as the Minister knows and as Irish Water has acknowledged.  Even if that is the case and 70% of people registered after a bribe of &euro;100 where the Government gave away free money to people to sign up, it did not really work.  That awkward 30% who would not be bribed by the &euro;100 so-called conservation measure, which does not have any conservation criteria attached to it in order to receive it, still exists.  The only thing people have to do to receive the grant is to sign up with Irish Water so desperate is the Government to get people to do it.  That did not work because that 30% of awkward people who are sick and tired of this Government and austerity and who say "No" to bribery still exists.  The Government now has to bring in a law and statute that makes it compulsory for people to register within 20 days of the Bill being passed.  Will the Minister admit that he could not get people to volunteer so he now has to force them?  This is what this measure is an admission of.  </p> <p> I am beginning to wonder about the Minister's registration figures.  Registration does not equal payment because we all know people may register for the &euro;100 grant but it does not mean that they will pay the bills.  People may register because their landlord has pressured them or have even registered them.  That 30% cannot be forced to register so the Minister had to bring in a law today.  In light of the circumstances in which he is doing so, bypassing Committee Stage, he should admit defeat, that he has not been able to persuade the 30% and that he must legally force them to register.  Can the Minister clarify what the penalty for not registering is?  That was not made very clear and is really important.  Is it just a toothless law?  The Minister is saying people must register but I am not clear what the penalty is if they do not register.  Will we all be rounded up in dawn raids at 7 a.m. and whipped into Mountjoy Prison?  What is the situation because people deserve to know that from this debate today?  </p></speech>

There is a charge of &euro;260 for a household with more than two people.  What I have just spoken about is a case of ripping off youngsters who are going to college.  Something needs to be done to deal with this problem because &euro;130 multiplied by nine is &euro;1,170.  We need to make sure that landlords like these do not rip off these youngsters.</p></speech>

Other speakers have outlined the difficulty this creates for tenants who are obliged to register with Irish Water within 20 days of this legislation being passed and the question of whether the landlord has to register as well.  It also affects individual householders who have not registered.  Perhaps I am wrong but from my reading of it, the relevant section says that the person must register with Irish Water as a customer and confirm whether or not the dwelling is their principal private residence.  If somebody is obliged to register and confirm that it is their principal private residence, it has the same effect.  Basically, this is targeting everybody who has not registered with Irish Water regardless of whether they are landlords or tenants.</p>  <p>  It shows that the Government's policy has failed.  Its attempt to introduce a second charge for water services for citizens across the country is a failure when one sees that it has to act in this way, introduce it in such significant legislation and bypass discussion on Second and Committee Stages about the potential impact of legislation such as this.  It shows the complete failure of Government policy relating to Irish Water.  It shows all the citizens who have stood in principled opposition to the introduction of a second water charge that they are right to stand together and oppose this unfair and unjust water tax.  It is vitally important that the message that the citizens who are standing together against Irish Water are defeating the Government and Irish Water goes out here today from the House.  I call on people to continue to stand together in the face of the draconian measures that have been introduced by the Government.</p>  <p>  What will gall people across the country is the underhand way it has been dealt with and the way it has been slid in as an amendment on Report Stage when it should be amending legislation in its own right as a water services Bill.  The citizens know what the Government is doing and that they have it on the ropes.  Clearly, the roll-out of Irish Water has been a failure, people are refusing to pay the water bills and the boycott of water charges exists across the country because if this was not the case and if there was any sense in Irish Water and the Government that people were signing up to and paying this second water tax, the Government would be releasing figures on a regular basis showing the percentage of people who have paid and complied with the Government's demands relating to Irish Water.  It shows the success of the campaign.  People should take great encouragement from that.  It shows that this Government has been forced into doing things like this in an underhand way to impose a potential class A fine on citizens who take a principled opposition to its policy on this austerity tax and this further attack on citizens.</p><p>It shows also that this Government has not got a mandate to continue with the implementation of Irish Water and with the imposition of the second tax on citizens.  It has a huge impact on tenants and potential tenants.  In cases where householders decide not to register with Irish Water, being the owner-occupiers they cannot be evicted for non-compliance with this section and will at least have a roof over their heads if they refuse to comply.  However, tenants are in a very precarious situation, as if Government policy had not left them in a precarious enough situation with the complete and utter refusal to deal with the rent allowance and rent supplement and the refusal of this Government to introduce any measures for rent certainty and certainty for tenancies.  The Government hides behind the constitutional provisions when it says it cannot do anything about that.  It leaves tenants in a very vulnerable position.</p> <p> We will all take strength from the position we are in because we know that this is a Government that is defeated on this issue and we know that the days of Irish Water are numbered because the Government has to resort to this kind of tactic to threaten people and potentially to impose fines if they do not register with Irish Water within the timeframe the Government has set out in this legislation.  If the Government wanted to convince people of the argument and the need to pay this second water tax they would not need to introduce measures like this to hide behind and to force people into it.  People were concerned and were frightened by the Government's imposition of the property tax but they have decided that they have had enough.  They have stood against the water charges and they will continue with the boycott campaign against the charges.  The other side of it is that not registering is a form of opposition but not registering does not matter if a person is not going to pay.  The boycott campaign will continue and Irish Water will collapse on the basis that it cannot raise the revenue it needs to keep going.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 21 states:<blockquote><b>23A.</b>(1) Where water services are provided to a dwelling by Irish Water, the owner of the dwelling shall, subject to subsections (2) and (3)&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(a) register with Irish Water as a customer and confirm whether or not the dwelling is his or her principal private residence,</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>I take it there is now an onus on everybody to register with Irish Water.  While I cannot see it here, presumably the legislation provides for some penalty for not registering with Irish Water, because there is never a provision in a Bill without a penalty for not complying with that provision.  When the Minister is replying, he might outline the penalty for not registering with Irish Water.  The amendment further states:<blockquote>(6) A person who registers with, or notifies, Irish Water under subsection (1) and provides information which to his or her knowledge is false or misleading in a material respect commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.</blockquote>That covers a person who registers and gives information that is false, but it does not clarify for me what happens if they do not register.  Let us suppose I am correct that there is a penalty for not registering.  It would not make sense to have a Bill with an obligation but without a penalty.  This goes back to what I was saying about the macho war going on between the two sides here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200045#SS05700"><p>Where I am is that I think this should have been handled in a better way.  We have an arbitrary cut-off date for the grant.  The first thing the Minister could do would be to get his colleague and party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, to say that it is not too late to register to be eligible for the grant.  That is the first thing she could do.</p>  <p>  When the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, was here last night, I made it clear that I welcome one element of all of this, which is that people who were paying general taxation and motor taxation were getting the half-benefit or no benefit from the public expenditure on water and sewerage services.  I have been saying that for years.  Unlike some Deputies in the House, I do not have, nor have I ever had, a principled objection to water charges.  I have suffered personally from having to operate a well for years.  If we had a continuation of the same Minister in the House dealing with the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, would have known that I said all this last night, but I will repeat it for his benefit.  I said last night that I and all my neighbours with wells used to end up changing washing machines and dishwashers every few years because they used to get corroded from the type of water in our area.  We were still paying all the taxation that was funding all the water and sewerage systems of the country.</p>  <p>  There is fairness.  I remember the arguments we had with the former Minister and now Commissioner, Commissioner Hogan, on the famous Water Services (No. 2) Bill on septic tanks.  I always maintained that it was during that Bill that he said there would not be charges for water out, but he suddenly realised that all hell would break loose if people who got two services were paying the same amount as people who got only one service or no service.  I believe that part of this Bill is fair.</p>  <p>  However, the Minister could do a considerable amount to improve the Bill and make it fairer.</p><p>First, he could get rid of the arbitrary decision made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection that if one registers now or in a week's time, one will not receive the grant.  That is unnecessary and stupid.  Second, he should give a very clear directive that, rather than saying a never-never pay bill which does not solve the problem for those who are out of cash, there will be funding made available and a directive given to community welfare officers to the effect that, where they think water charges are putting a burden on household which cannot be carried, they will have discretion to make an exceptional needs payment.  Third, there are people who are being foolishly advised not to register and not to pay.  This vulnerable section of the community, many of whom are highly concentrated in local authority housing estates, will, I presume, wind up with fines for not registering.  They will lose the &euro;100 grant and receive a full bill.  The State is patient and in two or three years time the Minister will send a summons and seek an attachment of earnings order in court.  That is the game; that is the way it works.  At that stage, those who have told them not to register will not be outside the court or standing before them - most will not go to court because very few people like going to court - writing cheques for them and apologising, saying it was their bad advice that had cost them this huge sum of money.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-02a.846" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070200046#TT00300"><p>The Minister is adding to the problem.  He knows that this is going to happen and is planning for it to happen.  Why does he not do something about it?</p>  <p>  I have tabled amendment No. 11 to amendment No. 21.  The way the Bill is being produced is unusual.  I have never seen it done in this way in all my time in the House and I have seen Bills produced in many ways but one learns something new every day.  My amendment is reasonable.   Deputy Brian Stanley and others have raised legitimate concerns about the fact that we are not quite sure of the outworkings of the landlord and tenant provisions and the effect they might have on a tenancy.  We all know that the law of unintended consequences is a major concern for everybody putting legislation through the House.  The Minister should look into his own heart and say he recognises that unintended consequences are a major challenge when trying to steer legislation through.</p>  <p>  We have suggested the Minister include a statutory provision that this section and its impact on tenancy terminations will be subject to review by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, after it has come into operation and the report should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within not less than 12 months and not more than 14 months.  The idea is that we will not sail off into the sunset, having passed the legislation, and hear that it is having an effect without having obliged the State agency responsible for landlord and tenant law to make a formal report and an independent assessment on behalf of the State.  If there is an impact, the Minister could bring forward amending legislation to deal with the issue.  Otherwise it would fester on, be put on the long finger and people might suffer unintended consequences.  It would be a safety valve.</p>  <p>  If we were debating this Bill in the proper manner on Committee Stage, at the very least the Minister would say he would consider the amendment and respond on Report Stage.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is quite good at dealing with legislation.  I have arguments with him about other matters, but I grant that when it comes to legislation, he follows very good processes and takes on board amendments tabled by the Opposition, reads them and, in many cases, has come back and given a rational explanation for not accepting them or come back with alternative wording from the Parliamentary Counsel that gives effect to the genesis of the Opposition amendment.  Since the Minister does not have that option to come back, I ask him to accept amendment No. 11 to amendment No. 21 as being a reasonable provision that would provide a safety net to deal with unintended consequences in the case of landlords and tenants.  I hope he will give me some comfort about what he will do for a very vulnerable group who will get caught up because the legislation he is bringing forwards exacerbates the risks of fines, penalties and charges, as well as the lack of a grant when they are caught in the net.</p></speech>

On the interaction earlier between him and Deputy Jerry Buttimer, I have to say Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has always acted on behalf of all the interests of his constituency, regardless of age, colour, sexual orientation or religion.  He has always acted without fear or favour.  In fairness to Deputy Jerry Buttimer, he did say it was not part of Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s political ideology.</p>  <p>  The Minister and his colleagues in the Labour Party could have chosen a different course after the 2011 general election.  They could have occupied the seats opposite and engaged in the political rhetoric we have heard from Sinn F&eacute;in, some of the Opposition groups and the Independents in the recent past., but they chose not to.  They chose to put the country first.  Although we have made very difficult decisions and people have had to make great sacrifices, as a result of the courage of the Minister and his colleagues in the Labour Party, the country is in a much stronger place today than it was in 2011.</p>  <p>  There were six divisions between last night and this morning on the scheduling of the Report Stage debate; Members objected and wanted more time.  There is one member of Sinn F&eacute;in present, Deputy Brian Stanley.  There is no member of Renua present, even though it strenuously opposed and voted against the Order of Business today. </p></speech>

The amendment about the Bill&rsquo;s effect on landlord and tenant relations is an example of these concerns.  Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned the metering issue.  There are provisions in the leases signed by landlords and tenants on outstanding Electric Ireland bills and meter readings.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  There are standard and straightforward procedures and practices in place to deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s valid concerns.  Before the full details of the scheme were revealed, when fear and misinformation were allowed to fester in the absence of facts, there was anxiety about affordability and concerns about the fairness of the scheme.  The debate we had yesterday and again today feeds that anxiety.</p><p>There is a cohort of militant protestors, guided and incited by some of the Members present in the House, who have no regard for rule or for reason and do not represent the majority of people, either for or against the introduction of these charges.  We saw it here yesterday at Leinster House, where Members were intimidated and refused entry to the Houses of Parliament.  I met Senator Paschal Mooney, who was leaving yesterday afternoon to attend a hospital appointment.  The man was shaking when I met him on the plinth.  He was arriving back in from his car, having attempted to leave the campus after having been instructed to do so.  He rolled down his window to try to engage with the protestors outside and to explain to them he had a hospital appointment to attend, and it was the worst thing he could possibly have done because the intimidation only increased.</p></speech>

There are already systems in place to deal with that under existing landlord-tenant law and existing leases.  I do not believe it is an issue that will cause huge concern for tenants.</p>  <p>  I would urge tenants, landlords and home owners not to follow the advice of Deputy Murphy, Sinn F&eacute;in and some Independent Deputies by boycotting this charge.  I have seen what can happen.  Two ladies attended my constituency clinic in recent weeks who wished to avail of some grant assistance to work on their homes and they find that the property charge, which was modest initially, has now escalated.  In one case, the lady took the advice of her son not to pay the charge and she ended up paying considerably more than she would have paid if she had registered.</p><p>The same will befall those who refuse to pay the water charge.  A very reasonable charge has been introduced.  For a single person who registers, a fee of &euro;160 applies, minus the &euro;100 water conservation grant, giving a net cost of &euro;60 per year.  That equates to one ATM withdrawal in Greece.  It is a very reasonable figure and I urge homeowners and tenants to ignore the advice being presented by Opposition Members.  They should register and pay the charge.  Ultimately, they will end up paying it one way or another.</p></speech>

Landlords have been providing tenant details for Irish Water, in accordance with section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act.  The Data Commissioner is fully aware of this and Irish Water has been in ongoing contact with the commissioner about all of its activities to ensure it is in accordance with the Acts.</p>  <p> Deputy Ruth Coppinger put forward a novel proposal, demanding a guarantee that there would be no evictions as a result of non-payment.  If she had listened to what her colleague Deputy Paul Murphy had said, she would have received a response because he guaranteed that there would be no evictions.</p></speech>

It is standard practice in residential leases for tenants to pay their utility bills.  They include their water bills.  Therefore, there is no basis on which to predict a landlord will seek to evict tenants for not paying their water bills, over and above the non-payment of any other utility bill.  Tenants have the full rights of the PRTB process provided under the Residential Tenancies Act.  It should also be noted that when evictions happen, it is usually down to non-payment of rent or antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley and others raised concerns about tenancies.  Once it is established that there is a tenancy, the relationship between Irish Water and the tenant is for the duration of the tenancy.  Where it changes, the tenant has a number of choices.  The outgoing tenant can read the meter - the Irish Water website explains in simple terms how he or she can do this - or he or she can contact Irish Water to close the account or ask it for a reading.  The incoming tenant can also read the meter.  This is simple to do and the instructions on how to do it are on the website.  Ultimately, if there are problems, they can be referred to the CER, if not resolved satisfactorily.  There is a process to deal with issues raised.  The meters can be read by customers.</p></speech>

Student accommodation is generally classified as being part of the non-domestic sector; therefore, charges are made through that process.  I expect the model for charges in that sector to be examined for the future.</p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about class A fines.  This category of fine only applies to offences where false, misleading or malicious information on occupancy of a dwelling is provided for Irish Water.  There is no class A fine for not registering.  Deputies asked about non-compliance and what would happen if people did not register.  If they do not register, they will receive a bill and be fined if they do not pay it.  This is all documented.  Subsequently, through the legislation that will be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, tomorrow, a process will be in place to manage and deal with the debt.  Unfortunately, Deputy Paul Murphy will be away and not in the Chamber tomorrow to deal with that legislation.  I hope he enjoys his trip to Greece to see one of the biggest climb downs in the history of Europe.  It is true that nothing will happen initially, but something substantial will happen.  I do not always agree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, but he was right to ask about this issue.  With the misguided information Deputy Paul Murphy has given to many people on not paying, I am looking forward to seeing his cheque book come out in a couple of years when those who took his advice come up to ask how they are going to pay their bill. </p>  <p>  On the amendment brought forward by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who was not here when I spoke earlier, I have already said I oppose it.  It proposes that the provisions outlined in section 23A be subject to review by the PRTB.  Section 23A does not impose a new obligation on tenants; therefore, I will not accept the amendment.  Tenants retain all of the rights they have in the PRTB process provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act.  </p>  <p>  Some Deputies referred to the issue of deposits.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and I intend to bring forward legislation in the near future to protect people's deposits.</p></speech>

He is, obviously, unaware of some matters.  On the meters in place in Northern Ireland, he is, obviously, unaware that legislation is required to stop their installation.  I believe he is also unaware that Sinn F&eacute;in tried to introduce legislation to prevent them from being installed.  Some 30,000 meters were fitted, which was a waste of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

The Unionist Minister showed some interest in the Bill prior to the election and I hope he continues with it because Sinn F&eacute;in is anxious to get the legislation through.</p>  <p>  A system of charges was put in place by the British Government prior to the re-establishment of the Assembly and Executive in 2007.  We gave a solemn commitment that we would do our level best as part of a multi-party government - it subsequently became a five-party government - under power sharing.  The Ministers will be aware that the way the system works is different to here because of the different circumstances.  We used the influence we had to prevent water charges from being introduced.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Minister, Conor Murphy, succeeded in that regard and thus far, the situation has held up and the other parties, including the SDLP share our position.  The Social Democratic Labour Party, SDLP, is a sister party of the party of the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  It shares our position on the matter and we have worked very well together on it-----</p></speech>

Northern Ireland Water is not a perfect beast by any standards but the Minister should note that it is directly under the control of the Assembly and the Executive.  That is a far different arrangement to what was done by the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and the previous Minister, Phil Hogan.  They pumped money into Irish Water and continue to do so.  It is an entity over which we have no control.  The Minister of State criticised Fianna F&aacute;il about IBRC, banking bailouts and various other issues, including money going into institutions over which we have no control.  He has done the same thing with Irish Water.  The situation in the North is not perfect but at least the water company is a public body and it is under the direct control of the Minister and must report to him, the Executive and the Assembly.

Those who will get into trouble are those who move from one accommodation to another.  The Minister said it is easy to read the meters.  It is not.  I looked at the one outside my house and I will try to figure it out again but I have not worked out how to read it.</p></speech>

They are people who have been pinned to their collar and in some cases cannot afford to pay the water charges and in other cases refuse to pay on principle, but are part of the biggest social movement we have seen in this country for decades.  The irony should not be lost on the House and the public of Deputies opposite referring to anti-democratic behaviour at the gates of the Parliament.  Never mind the gates of the Parliament, let us look inside the Parliament and the way that this debate is being conducted.  The debate will be guillotined at 9 o'clock.  We will not get a chance to get through all of the amendments, but even if we agreed to stick to five minutes discussion on each and to get through them all, the point is that it is not proper scrutiny.</p><p>The point is that the amendments are not being scrutinised in any sense seriously.  By not allowing a committee to examine them properly, the Government is not allowing space to scrutinise them.  It is anti-democratic.  The introduction of water charges, in contravention of the Labour Party's mandate, is also anti-democratic.</p> <p> While amendment No. 21 places a legal obligation on everybody to register, the Minister's response is not 100% clear and I would like 100% clarity.  His response suggests, incredibly, that the Government is introducing a legal obligation that carries no penalty for non-registration.  I will deal with the penalties for non-payment, etc. later.  I am not sure if it is normal to have a legal obligation that carries no penalty for non-compliance.  Normally, laws go with sanctions for breaking them.  I am interested in the Minister's returning to the point, not referring to other penalties that may apply.  Although the amendment introduces a legal obligation to register with Irish Water, the amendments we have seen so far which effectively constitute a new Bill carry no penalty for non-registration.  I would like 100% clarity on the matter.</p> <p> It suits the Government to give the impression that water charges can be deducted from tenants' deposits.  However, I asked the Minister to clarify - he did not answer - that where the bill was in the name of a tenant, the bill would follow the tenant.  The bill cannot be deducted from the tenant's deposit.  The landlord will not take it, has no incentive to take it and legally cannot do so.  We need clarity on the matter before we vote on the amendments.  The exception is a circumstance in which the landlord has not handed over the tenant's name or where the landlord puts the bill in his or her own name in short-term tenancies of a few months.  In such a situation, in theory, it could be taken from the deposit under the tenancy agreement, but we need clarity.  Where a landlord hands over the name, which he or she would have an obligation to do under the legislation, the bill will be in the tenant's name and, from then on, the landlord will have nothing to do with it and cannot reach in and deduct it from the tenant's deposit.  As I suggested, the bill would follow the tenant without any reference to the landlord.  I would like an answer from the Minister.</p> <p> Incredibly, although nothing is incredible here anymore, the Minister claimed that, with others leading the non-payment campaign, who are proudly calling on people to boycott as a way to win, I am misinforming people about the consequences of not paying.  He should read what we write, our leaflets, articles and the new frequently asked questions on the legislation which we have published.  We are always explicitly clear about the penalties and consequences of non-payment.  I will outline them and if I miss any, the Minister should feel free to add to them.  We deal with people and the facts and show how the penalties and charges can be defeated.</p> <p> By declining to register, people will miss out on the &euro;100 conservation grant.  The grant is a con.  Although the Minister alleges that it will be paid for several years, I do not believe this.  It is something to get people into the system.  If the water charges remain, the grant will be discontinued.  We all know that it has nothing to do with conservation.  If the water charges are defeated, it will also be discontinued.  There will be no penalties for non-payment until approximately July 2016, when a household with one adult will incur a penalty of &euro;30 and a household with two adults or more will incur a penalty of &euro;60.  That is it.  The Bill about which we will talk tomorrow and next week-----</p></speech>

This means that it will take two years of non-payment before the first of two court cases could take place.  We are not hiding it from people.  We are saying that if the Government remains in power and committed to water charges, court cases could begin at the end of 2017.  There must be two court cases before attachment of earnings orders can be applied.  We are telling people we can defeat water charges, given that, before penalties apply, apart from the conservation grant which is a con, we will have something called an election.  We will have the unfortunate intrusion of democracy which has the European elites so scared as they consider the situation in Greece.  In a context in which a huge number of people are not paying, there will be immense pressure on all political parties in an election and the Government after it to abolish water charges.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael and the Labour Party abolished water charges previously and fair play to them for doing so.  It was not because they wanted to do it or due to a commitment to providing a free, decent public water supply for everybody in the country but because they were forced to do it by the pressure of non-payment and pending elections.  A future Government can be forced to abolish water charges and the election is the key time when it could happen.  People can boycott the water charges at least until the general election with no negative consequences.  Penalties will apply in July 2016.  Even if, after the general election, we have a Government that is intent on sticking with the water charges, we can defeat court action.  During the previous water charges battle there were hundreds, if not slightly more than 1,000, court cases to try to disconnect people's water supply.  However, they did not break non-payment.  The court cases became a focal point of protest and political pressure.  The people were not abandoned, as some suggested, and water charges were subsequently defeated.  Only a small number of people can be taken to court and if the others mobilise to defend them, this can become more of an embarrassment and point of political pressure against the Government.</p>  <p>  We do not misinform but inform people accurately, as a result of which they are not scared.  The inaccurate information from the Government, the headlines the Minister managed to get suggesting Irish Water could deduct payments from wages, social welfare payments and pensions, in the same way as the property tax, is the only thing that intimidates people.  It is why we have not seen the amendments until now.  The Government's aim is to keep a cloud over what is taking place, to give the lie that there is more of a threat than there is.  The truth empowers people.  It gives them the confidence to stand up to the bullying and scaremongering taking place.</p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to confirm the absence of a penalty for non-registration and that if a bill is in the tenant's name, the landlord cannot dip into the deposit, in line with the process for other utility bills such as those from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  </p>  <p>  I think I had another question which the Minister might have noted.</p></speech>

One of my colleagues printed off the meter reading process published on the website, which shows exactly how one can read one's meter.  Deputy Paul Murphy can use whatever language and sell whatever message he wants.  It is his own business and I cannot stop him, nor do I intend to.  He can say he is going to defeat this, that and the other and fair play to him, if he believes in it.  I believe in peaceful protest and have different views.</p></speech>

It is a fair point.  The purpose of the Bill is to clarify who will be liable for water bills by setting out the respective responsibilities of landlords and tenants.  If the landlord does not register the premises, he or she is liable for the bill.  If somebody does not register with Irish Water, he or she will lose the &euro;100 grant.</p></speech>

I presume people have already lost their &euro;100 grant because they followed his advice.  I will not call them a gang or a cabal.  His supporters or friends did not register and they have lost &euro;100 as a result.  They will get the default bill and they will not be able to beat the cap.  It could also cost them an accumulating fine and this can be dealt with under the debt legislation being brought through the House tomorrow.  Deputy Paul Murphy will skip that debate when he flies over to Greece to show solidarity with his friends.</p></speech>

He is leading people to the top of the hill and then he will blatantly abandon them.  I look forward to the day when he runs out of cheques to pay the bills of all the people who come to his door because of the advice he gave them.  It is all very well to say there is a possibility but the reality is that he is leading people astray by telling them they will never have to pay for something.  Unless he intends make a big climb-down to sit on this side of the House in order to change the legislation, which I do not believe he does because he cannot take responsibility or make hard decisions, what he promises will never happen.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that Deputy Murphy will abandon his people after he walks them to the top of the hill.  I am looking forward to the day when he has to answer for that.  We have to manage expectations and manage people in an appropriate and fair way.  It is irresponsible to lead people up the garden path.  The majority of us in this House believe that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy will not defeat this because it is the right thing to do for future generations and to provide an alternative model for water infrastructure.  It is the right thing to do because it allowed me to launch a programme for 23,000 jobs today.  It is the right thing to do for the people of counties Roscommon and Tipperary who have been on boil water notice for many years.  Did the Deputy ever sit down with the major industries which are water dependent?  I would like an answer to that question.</p></speech>

It is vital that tenants' deposits are protected for the right reasons, although there is a minority of cases in which it is the other way around.  This is why I intend to introduce legislation to protect deposits.  I have committed to such legislation and I am sure the Deputy will welcome it.  However, if a customer of Irish Water is a tenant, Irish Water will have to pursue him or her as such.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 11 inserts a new section 33 into the Bill.  This section provides for the amendment of section 10 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 to bring it into accord with the Fines Act, 2010.  It also designates proposed offences by collectors, punishable by fixed payment notice, and an offence of providing misleading, false information as non-indictable offences.</p><p>Amendment No. 12 inserts a new section 34 which, in turn, provides for the insertion of a new section 10B into the Waste Management Act to provide for the introduction of a number of fixed payment notices or on-the-spot fines for household waste collectors where they commit certain offences that constitute a breach of specified conditions of a permit.  Examples of permit breaches that would attract new fixed payment notices include a failure to carry a copy of the relevant waste collection permit in a waste collection truck, a failure to display a permit number on a collection truck, and deposition of waste at a facility other than the facility named on the collection permit.  The fixed payment notice is to be set at &euro;500.  As with other fixed payment notice arrangements beyond the legislation, if the person chooses not to pay the fine, the local authority can initiate a formal prosecution for the offence.</p><p>The fixed payment notice is being used on the basis that the punishment for a minor offence of a &euro;500 fine should be swift and proportionate and should not require a court case which takes up valuable local authority enforcement and court resources.  Other more serious breaches are not suitable for fixed payment notices and will remain indictable.  For example, where a collector breaches a condition relating to the requirement to operate a pay by weight system, its permit will automatically fall for review with the possibility of revocation.</p></speech>

There is probably no difficulty with some of the provisions, but it would have been very helpful to have had a decent Second Stage debate to discuss some of the issues being addressed by way of amendments.</p>  <p>  The waste industry has left a trail of destruction in its wake in some parts of the country and some of the problems have been very expensive to remediate.  There have been improvements during the years, but I still have very serious concerns about oversight, the industry and the ability of the EPA and local authorities to monitor waste management.  Essentially, remediation has cost an absolute fortune in some areas.  I have referred before to the waste mountain that grew on the outskirts of Naas.  It was only when it went on fire that it became an issue of national importance.  The fire service was on site for three or four weeks.  The then Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, more or less said the authorities had better go in and do what was needed, but there had been complaints to the EPA for years, in spite of which the waste mountain continued to grow.  It is costing in the region of &euro;40 million to remediate the problem and we do not know what damage was done to watercourses.</p>  <p>  There are similar circumstances in County Meath where groundwater was poisoned by dumping.  It caused serious health problems which cannot be quantified.  Therefore, it is really important that we get waste legislation right.</p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 11, it seems there is a reduction in the fine from &euro;5,000 to &euro;3,000.  Is this in line with the Fines Act?  Is it a new figure or a figure that has been varied?</p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 12, there is a fixed penalty.  The Minister referred to a failure to have a permit and a failure to be visually compliant.  I am all in favour of cutting down on administration if something can be done in a much more direct way.  In this regard, I have some proposals to make on parking fines in other legislation.  If a local authority does have to prosecute, will the fine be substantially more?  Will it encourage local authorities to commence court proceedings?  It can be so draining and expensive administratively to take the court route.  However, I accept the Minister's point that this is about ensuring compliance or, at the very least, visual compliance.</p></speech>

There is nothing that Deputy Catherine Murphy said with which I would not agree.  Her points were very relevant and pertinent.  In some ways, I have similar comments to make.  </p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister on the overall legislation, including this amendment.  He has been extraordinarily proactive and grasped very difficult issues in his Department.  He has done so with extraordinary deftness and success.  These are issues that, for the sake of the people, we have a responsibility to address.  Issues include providing clean water on demand for all citizens and having a proper waste management system.  Even if it is unpopular to implement proposals in this regard and it does not appear politically smart at the outset, we must do what is right.  Ultimately, that is what we are in government to do.  This Minister is an extraordinary good example in that regard.  Having served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann with him for five years, I am not surprised that his calibre is reflected in his ministry.</p>  <p>  I am in favour of the concept of the fixed payment on the grounds that it prevents unnecessary, cumbersome and expensive court cases.  It prevents the waste of the apparatus of the legal system which needs to be deployed elsewhere.</p><p>The fixed fine is a very good option.  It must deal with illegal dumping and misconduct by alleged contractors.</p> <p> We should lower the costs of waste collection at every conceivable opportunity.  We all know how burdened our people are and the sacrifices they have had to make over the past four or five years.  We should lower the cost of waste collection and processing while having a fit-for-purpose regime.</p> <p> I am interested in the concept of weight as a method of achieving recycling rather than a flat annual charge.  I am very hopeful this will produce good results.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's comments on this.  If people pay for waste collection by weight, they are more likely to recycle.  I am hopeful this would be the outcome.  I am not sure enough is done in composting.  It is an area of recycling that offers a lot of potential and I hope we could encourage that.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we are very lucky to have very effective waste management policies and very good local authorities dealing with it.  We have very good recycling centres.  The town in which I am privileged to live, Bailieborough, has an exemplary and well-run recycling centre that is well used.  That is the case throughout the constituency.  Recycling needs to be dealt with.</p> <p> The other area that needs effective action is illegal dumping.  If we encourage recycling, make waste collection as cheap as possible and avoid illegal dumping, the Minister would be remembered for yet another enormous success within the Department because this is a very real issue.  Illegal dumping is a threat to tourism and public health and is a crime against those who pay their charges.  There have been obscene and reprehensible examples of illegal dumping in some very scenic parts of County Cavan with detrimental effects on public health.  A very vigilant waste management policy is dealing with it and we have had a lot of success in that area.  Will the Minister respond to me about illegal dumping, the use of fixed fines and immediate processing to get people to comply and to regard illegal dumping in the same way they properly regard drink driving, as culturally unacceptable?</p> <p> We need fit-for-purpose waste collection and recycling systems, domestic recycling through composting and education in that regard.  There are many good developments relating to green flags in schools and developing awareness.  There are many examples of good things happening in our schools, communities and recycling centres, so there is much to be happy about.  However, we should never be complacent about these things.</p> <p> I am anxious that we progress waste management, get rid of the blight of illegal dumping and encourage recycling.  I am very taken with the concept of the fixed charge and I look forward to speaking on the new debt Bill in this regard.  The wasteful use of the courts is a pity when there are so many delays in proper cases, including criminal procedures, that should be going ahead.  Where possible, fixed fines should be used and debt collection should be by attachment order.  We should not waste prison spaces on debtors and the courts system on offenders in the waste area.</p> <p> This is good, reforming and courageous legislation.  That it is not always politically acceptable in the narrow, short-term and populist sense might be an indication that it is ultimately in the long-term good.</p></speech>

Who is the Minister targeting?  I assume he is not talking about large waste management companies with large contracts.  I had the impression on reading it that he might be directing it at smaller-scale clothes collectors and the preponderance of unofficial collecting of waste.  I am at a loss as to why we would lower a fine from &euro;5,000 to &euro;3,000.  If it is directed at companies, I would have thought something like &euro;3,000 would not be that much of a disincentive.  This question relates to amendment No. 11.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 12 concerns a fixed penalty of &euro;500 for people suspected of not having a waste collection permit.  Will the Minister differentiate between the two amendments and give us an idea of the kind of groups he is targeting?</p></speech>

I am not too sure these amendments get to the heart of the matter.  The heart of the matter with regard to waste is minimising what we produce.  If we can minimise the problem we are creating in the first place, we are putting lasting solutions in place.  We have not turned the waste hierarchy 360 degrees yet in that the first thing we start talking about is recycling.  Recycling, or at worst landfill, deals with waste at the end.  Recycling is only the second worst option but it is obviously a better option than just disposal or incineration.  We should be working the other way around.  It should be waste minimisation at source.</p>  <p>  A suggestion was put forward yesterday about universal-type bottles that could be agreed.  Every company that produces paper produces it in A4 size.  There are other good examples.  It would be good if we could make some progress on this and reduce the amount we are producing.  For some reason, much of the drinks containers that are disposed of are Coca-Cola containers.  I am not too sure why this is the case.  I know that a lot of Coca-Cola is consumed.  Most people who drink Coca-Cola dispose of the containers properly but many bottles and other containers are just dumped out of car windows all over the place.  One can see them on the slip roads coming off the motorways and local authority personnel have to pick them up.  Tidy Towns committees and residents' associations like the one in which I am involved also have to keep picking this stuff up.</p>  <p>  The Minister talks about a fixed fine.  In general, a fixed notice is okay but the problem I see is that a fixed notice of &euro;3,000 is a severe enough penalty for a small operator or someone who commits an offence under this section or section 10 of the 1996 Act.  It could be argued that it might be a bit over the top in some cases.  We have heard about and seen some terrible cases of dumping in all counties and waste being transported between jurisdictions</p><p>We all want to get on top of this and to stamp it out.  Amendment No. 12 proposes at subsection (1), paragraph (b): "the person may, during the period of 21 days beginning on the date of the notice make to the local authority concerned at the address specified in the notice a payment of &euro;500 in respect of that offence, accompanied by the notice,".  My concern is that the scale of the fine may not be appropriate.  It needs to be matched to the crime.  The fixed notice is a one-size-fits-all situation which does not always do justice.</p> <p> I refer to a further provision in amendment No. 1 at subsection (4) "Moneys received by a local authority pursuant to the giving of a fixed payment notice shall be lodged to the credit of the local fund maintained by the local authority concerned pursuant to, and in accordance with, section 97 of the Local Government Act 2001 and expended in accordance with that section".  Has the Minister any view at this stage of how that fund could be utilised in order to help the environment or to deal with environmental issues?  The flaw in the amendments is that they do not appear to take into account the scale of the offences or the scale of the operation involved.  I have come across some terrible situations relating to waste management and illegal dumps with the local authorities trying to undo terrible harm caused by many thousands of tonnes of waste - dangerous waste in some cases - disposed of in a very hazardous way and with the potential for causing pollution and causing pollution to water courses and aquifers.  We want to see this stopped as well as encouraging the public to be more vigilant.</p> <p> When I was in primary school which was a few years ago now-----</p></speech>

We were taught to be vigilant about litter and the Tidy Towns committees were starting to get bedded down at the time.  I recently attended the hoisting of a green flag in a number of schools.  We seem to come back to the point where the amount of waste being disposed of is incredible.  People throw waste out of car windows.  In one carpark I saw four separate piles of litter.  This is an occasional occurrence on weekend mornings.  A person will wind down the car windows and throw out the litter of takeaway containers and drinks containers onto the path.  The scale of that practice is not the same as a big operator who is dumping thousands of tonnes of rubbish in a serious and hazardous way over a lengthy period.  The mechanisms available to local authorities are very weak when they try to pursue these operators and to undo the damage.  I remember hazardous waste being dumped in a rural area very close to houses.  It took years to pursue that case-----</p></speech>

This was quite close to the Minister's county.  The same rules should apply everywhere.  The Administration in the North is facing the same challenges as the Minister's county council in Tipperary and Laois County Council.  This problem is not confined to a particular corner of the island but we must try to deal with it and get on top of it.</p>  <p>  The weakness in both amendments is the level of fine which may not match the scale of the offence.  What has the Minister in mind with regard to the moneys received by the local authority pursuant to the giving of a fixed payment notice?</p></speech>

It is in the Deputy's own neck of the woods.  That was a serious issue which is being dealt with.  There is a learning opportunity from that and other issues.  This is all the more reason to introduce this legislation.  We might argue about individual components but in the broad strokes I would expect the majority of people to be in favour of the legislation.</p>  <p>  The waste industry needs to mature and it needs to accept its responsibilities.  I refer to the fly-by-night operators, the  people not being responsible in the industry and the people who probably should not be in that industry or are behaving in a manner that shows they should not be in that industry.  Those days are over.  I have taken a very tough line with that industry because it was necessary to do so from what I have received.  The industry did not live up to what was expected of it and the standards it was meant to maintain.  I put the industry on very high alert that if they did not step up to the mark - I am still saying this publicly - that I will look at changing the system under which they work.  That option is open to me.  I will look at the issue of how permits are given and I will look at a lot more aspects as well.  </p>  <p>  This legislation is very necessary.  It will bring a level of maturity to the industry and it will ensure that we move in a direction whereby those who have invested in performing satisfactorily in the industry will be able to do so and those who do not will simply have to exit.  From a regulatory point of view we thought it important to ensure greater oversight as a result of many of the issues which are familiar to Members.  We are putting in place regional authorities across the local authorities.  There will be three regional authorities which will have oversight of enforcement.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley asked a specific question for which I compliment him as it is a good question.  He asked where the money that is collected goes.  It goes straight back into enforcement to ensure that we have greater enforcement.  It is all very well having this legislation passed but there is a need for proper enforcement.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about the fixed fines and whether they will be lower.</p><p>They are not coming down; they are being brought in line with the Fines Act.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p> Deputy Ruth Coppinger asked about the distinction between the fixed payment fines of &euro;500 and &euro;3,000.  By way of example, the &euro;500 on-the-spot fine would be for not displaying proper identification or proper discs.  They are similar offences that are minor in nature.  The &euro;3,000 fine applies to other offences such as if an operator is not adhering to anything included in the permit, for example, if it does not have a customer charter in place or is not adhering to the charging structure under the permit and similar offences.  We already have comprehensive legislation covering this area.  Obviously, we have powers to deal with people who commit these offences.  On indictment we have the capacity to fine offenders up to &euro;15 million and anything in between.  Therefore, we have the capacity to deal with them.</p> <p> I have said publicly that there are many problems with this industry and that it needs to mature to a level that has not previously been seen.  I firmly believe those who behave in an unacceptable manner should be dealt with.  My desire is to ensure enforcement is at a level to ensure that will happen.  That is why we are introducing this suite of legislation on waste.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about learning lessons and we have to do that.  In the Naas experience it was the community, through Clean Air Naas, that demanded intervention and it came at a very late stage.  Regarding the organisations that would have had responsibility, it is one thing to have good legislation, but, obviously, it needs to be enforced.  Who will issue the fixed payment notices?  It is included in the civil code.  Presumably, they will be issued by the local authorities.  Are there designated individuals?  Is it part of the local authorities' workforce planning to have such individuals?  Will they be chasing around after bin trucks?  How does it manifest itself?  If it will be done by the local authorities, they will distribute the work and will want the return on time.  If only a very small number end up being fined, it may mean that it will not result in fines actually being paid.  Different local authorities have varying staffing ratios which impact on their capacity to do things.  I have addressed this issue with the Minister in another forum.  For example, Kerry County Council has twice the number of staff Meath County Council has, even though more people live in County Meath.  I often use this example because it is a very good comparator.  Therefore, the ability to do the job may vary, depending on the local authority involved.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if the EPA has an involvement.  If it does, it can be very good on the technical side, but I question if it has the hands-on capacity required.  It may not have a role in this issue.  It has an expanded role in climate legislation, meaning that its workload has been expanded.  I ask the Minister to address the issue of enforcement.</p></speech>

That could be a major matter or involve a number of major matters in terms of non-compliance.  If there are major issues and the operation is of a substantial scale, a fine of &euro;3,000 will not frighten a large operator that could run it to the edge in the hope it would not get caught and if it did, it would not be the end of the world, given that it would be a fixed charge of &euro;3,000.  Its one-size-fits-all nature will not do justice in terms of what should happen if a contractor is found guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  I have noticed that all small waste collection operators have been squeezed out.  I know of one small operator who has managed to keep going, but he has another job also.  He undertakes waste collection in a very small way and has a permit from the local authority.  He provides a Friday evening and Saturday bag collection service.  Such operators are finding it very difficult to continue operating, with most of them having been squeezed out.  The operator mentioned is for providing segregation of waste, which we support.</p>  <p>  Legislation in the first instance on minimising the waste we produce has been very weak.  I have not seen evidence that we are trying to ramp it up in order that we deal with issue before waste is produced.  We could save money in having to dispose of it.  For environmental purposes, creating all of this waste is a waste of energy, as well as money.  It imposes a cost on householders and retailers in having to dispose of it.  A fine of &euro;3,000 for not adhering to the requirements of a permit or waste licence will not terrify the daylights out of the biggest waste operators in the State.</p></speech>

We have more of an issue with what might be classified as waste that has been removed from development sites.  This is becoming a serious issue in my area and others.  Much of this waste is covered under Article 37 where the developer decides to move from one site to another and makes a self-determination as to what the waste is.  There was an incident recently where material was brought from a development in town to the Kerdiffstown site that Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned.  However, there has been a very slow response from the local authorities and the EPA.  The EPA always washes its hands of it and gives it back to the local authority.</p></speech>
