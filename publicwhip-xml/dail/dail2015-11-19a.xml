    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900003#A00500"><p>Consistent with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, the pace of economic growth and greater than forecasted tax receipts this year have allowed the Government to allocate, on a prudent basis, additional amounts to expenditure in priority areas.</p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates volume 2015 set out total gross voted expenditure for the year of &euro;53.231 million.  This level of expenditure was based on the assumption of coming in below the excessive deficit procedure deficit target of 2.9% and the level of revenue forecast at the time of budget 2015 in mid-October 2014.  As detailed in the Expenditure Report 2016, published on budget day last month, the gross voted expenditure forecast outturn for 2015 was revised to &euro;54.875 million, with the Government expenditure ceiling changed to reflect this adjustment.</p>  <p>  This extra funding of over &euro;1.6 billion for gross voted expenditure this year has allowed the Government to target additional expenditure in areas experiencing increased demand and pressures.  Importantly, with Ireland moving to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact from next year, this additional 2015 expenditure has been fully taken into account when assessing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact obligations.  While at this stage the definitive amounts in respect of the Supplementary Estimates have yet to be finally determined by all Departments, it is expected that the aggregate amount will be consistent with the additional amount included in the forecast outturn that we set on budget day.</p>  <p>  The general government deficit target for 2015 under the excessive deficit procedure is 2.9% of GDP.  Budget 2015 set a deficit target of 2.7%, but based on the forecasts published on budget day, the new deficit we have set for this year is revised down to 2.1%.</p>  <p>  The backdrop to additional spending this year is 2015 tax revenues exceeding forecast by over &euro;2 billion, delivering a deficit of 2.1% of GDP, and the significant expenditure reductions required since 2009 to return sustainability to the public finances.  Therefore, the additional expenditure represents a responsible approach towards ensuring that public services are adequately funded to meet social and economic objectives, both this year and next year.</p></speech>

That is precisely what he has said here today.  "We have it so we will spend it," is the new mantra from Deputy Howlin in the run-up to the general election.  I indicated in previous debates the extra &euro;7.3 billion the Minister is pumping into the Exchequer over the past 13 months, between last year's Supplementary Estimates, this year's Supplementary Estimates, and the extra funding in budget 2015 that he did not expect a month before the 2015 budget, to try and win the next election.  The Minister concluded by saying that they have extra revenue so they can spend it.</p>  <p>  I am surprised that this Government has not learnt any lesson from the past.  Some might be critical of that policy on previous occasions, but after what we have been through, for this Government to come in here today and say, "We have it so we will spend it" is reckless and shows the Government has learnt nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900003#A00700"><p>The Deputy, as usual, is completely wrong.  The deficit we set for this year was a demanding deficit to reach the target of below 3% of GDP.  When we framed the budget for 2015 in October of last year, it provided for a deficit of 2.9%.  In the spring, we reduced that to have an even tighter deficit of 2.7%.  The actual outturn, including the additional expenditure that I have outlined, will be a deficit of 2.1%.  Nobody in their wildest imaginations four years ago would have thought that by the end of 2015 we would have a deficit of 2.1% of GDP.  In fact, we are outperforming other much more developed economies that have not gone through the economic crisis that we have had.  It is absolutely prudent to keep a tight focus on reducing the deficit to 2.1% but at the same time to respond to pressures in our economy to provide decent funding levels to health and other areas, such as education, that the Deputy would demand in normal circumstances.</p></speech>

We were told they were sacrosanct.  He has now increased them by &euro;1.6 billion.  He has increased the expenditure ceilings by a quick announcement on budget day.</p>  <p>  The Minister states he had an extra &euro;2.2 billion in tax revenue and that almost &euro;2 billion of it will go on additional expenditure.  The logic is that if one of the big multinationals had thrown in an extra &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion in corporation tax this year, the Minister would have spent most of that also, and still maintain the deficit, on increasing underline, base expenditure for this year and next year going forward.  The Minister is making the capital mistake of increasing baseline expenditure on the basis of once-off tax receipts that were received this year that he knows he cannot guarantee will happen in subsequent years, and he is back to the mantra, "We have it so we will spend it".  If that is the way Deputy Howlin wants to win the election, that is his call.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister has not given us the figure for the 13 Supplementary Estimates even though they are published on the Order Paper.  Health, Social Protection and Environment, Community and Local Government are not in the list.  I will bet, at this stage, that the Minister knows but is refusing to tell us because I asked him for the figures by Department and he has not given them.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il is against the provision of these, even though we are more than meeting the stringent targets we set ourselves in terms of our deficit.  We have a recovering economy and more people at work.  This is a sustainable income stream because, as the T&aacute;naiste indicated to the House yesterday, just below 2 million are at work.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is, like the European Commission, that every cent of that additional revenue should be used to retire debt and, therefore, our deficit should be eliminated entirely rather than give some relief to people under pressure.  I reject that view.</p></speech>

There is no such thing as a bonanza for anybody.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road agreement, HRA, included commitments to restore the pay of serving public servants who took an additional pay cut in 2013.  Following negotiation between public service employers, unions and associations, an extension of the HRA, the Lansdowne Road agreement, was negotiated and ratified by the public service unions. The FEMPI Bill includes the necessary legislative provisions to give effect to the terms of the agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions included in the Bill, which apply to all public servants, including elected public servants, the Government, in approving the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement, decided that Ministers and special advisers should not avail of the pay restoration and pension-related deduction, PRD, now provided for in the FEMPI Bill. </p>  <p>  The Government has decided on a highly progressive amelioration of the specific measures applied to the pensions of former public servants.  I have ensured that the proposals included in the Bill to reduce the impact of public service pension reduction, PSPR, will significantly favour low paid public service pensioners.  Specifically, the FEMPI Bill provides for a maximum part-restoration of &euro;400 in 2016, an additional &euro;500 from 2017 and &euro;780 from 2018.  That is for everybody; nobody will get more than that. The Bill also retains the increased rate of 28% PSPR applied to that amount of pension in excess of &euro;100,000 which was enacted by the Bill I brought before the House in 2013.</p></reply>

How will Mr. Brian Cowen, former Taoiseach, who is currently struggling manfully on a pension of &euro;134,000 fare or John Bruton, former Taoiseach, on a pension of &euro;126, 000?  What of "We have it so we will spend it", former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, on a pension of &euro;108,000?  All of these will be in receipt of a restoration of pension under the Minister's legislation, which is a disgraceful notion.  For him to try to pretend that this is progressive in any way is laughable and well he knows it.  What about Ivor Callely, who has a conviction for mobile telephone expenses fraud and who is on a pension of &euro;62,000, or Mr. Ray Burke, who has a conviction for tax offences, yet is in receipt of a pension currently of more than &euro;95,000?</p></speech>

It would collapse the Bill constitutionally.  The Deputy knows that but that does not stop her playing politics with it.  Accordingly, the proposed amelioration under the Bill of the PSPR will apply to all impacted retired public servants on a basis that is indifferent to the vocational background of the pensioner, as it has to be because that is the constitutional advice we have.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that during the debate last night, Deputy Healy made a passionate speech from the Opposition benches in which he said his advice was that pensions enjoyed preserved rights under the Constitution and any reduction, once we begin to emerge from the emergency, would collapse this Bill.  I have, therefore, taken a prudent and careful line.  The maximum restoration anybody will get on either a low or high pension will be the same but I have ensured that there will be a 28% reduction for those on the top pensions and that it will not be touched by this legislation.</p></speech>

I know the Minister disagrees with me on this point.  Those pensions are indefensible, and were always indefensible, but particularly so given the era of austerity that has been visited on people throughout the country, which was delivered by some of the very same individuals who are on grossly excessive pensions.  I do not know how anybody could justify a pension of &euro;134,000 for the Taoiseach who presided over calamity, crash and chaos but, my God, anybody who argues that this pension should be bumped up by a further &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 is truly demented.</p>  <p>  The advantage is clear.</p></speech>

Excluding Lansdowne Road agreement related costs of &euro;43 million, the increase in the allocation for the Department of Education and Skills is more than five times the figure mentioned in the Deputy's question.  This reflects the fact that in estimating the year-on-year change in educational expenditure between this year and next account needs to be taken of the non-recurrence next year of a 2015 cash cost of &euro;127 million in relation to an accrual in respect of pay and pensions.  This is set out in the documentation.</p>  <p>  The expenditure report for next year sets out that an additional &euro;24 million, as the Deputy rightly said, has been allocated to new measures.  In specific terms, the budgetary and Estimates decisions will provide for an additional 2,260 teaching posts.  These include 810 extra teachers to meet demographic pressures, 300 extra teachers to reduce the staffing schedule in primary schools from 28:1 to 27:1; 550 extra teachers to reduce the staffing schedule in secondary schools from 19:1 to 18.7:1; and 600 extra resource teachers for special needs education.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the available fiscal space, the share allocated to expenditure increases and spending pressures in other areas, the additional funding resources allocated to education represent a significant commitment by the Government to the development and improvement of the education sector.  This must by allied with the significant capital announcement of almost &euro;3 billion made by the Minister for Education and Skills during the week.</p></speech>

Page 3 of the Minister's budget document lays out in black and white that of the &euro;1.5 billion available at a time of fiscal and economic expansion and in the context of all of the cuts at all of these levels of education, the total amount for new expenditure measures is &euro;24 million.  This is in contrast with the figure of &euro;561 million for a reduction in USC.  Similarly, on the next page of the Minister's budget document, we see that gross current expenditure will increase by &euro;44 million, while gross voted capital expenditure will decrease by &euro;73 million.  The net impact on the Department of Education and Skills, according to the Minister's budget document, is minus &euro;29 million.  Why has the Minister done this in the context of a decision to allocate more than &euro;560 million through one tax cut?</p></speech>

There is a non-recurring pay cost of &euro;127 million which must be taken into account when making the comparison between the figures for 2015 and 2016.  This should be clear.  The Deputy's figure is wrong, as I have explained already.  We have protected education expenditure throughout the crisis.  With regard to capital expenditure, we have built more schools than the previous Government did in boom times because it was a focus.  We have protected the pupil-teacher ratio throughout the crisis and are improving it.  As I said, we will allocate 2,260 additional teaching posts next year.  This cannot be met from the sum of money about which the Deputy has spoken.  We must look at once-off expenditure items which occur in a single year and will not recur before a year by year comparison is made, but, of course, the Deputy knows this.</p></speech>

Class sizes have not been protected by the Government, as well the Minister knows.  I will ask the question one more time.  I accept the argument about one-off non-recurring payments and I did hear it.  Nonetheless, the Minister had &euro;1.5 billion available and education is the single biggest driver of economic stability and growth to ensure equality of opportunity for children.  Of the figure of &euro;1.5 billion, the Minister decided that &euro;24 million was enough to allocate to the education system, but &euro;561 million was an adequate amount to give by way of a tax cut.  Why does he believe he should only allocate an additional &euro;24 million from the figure of &euro;1.5 billion as opposed to more than &euro;560 million through one tax cut?</p></speech>

We have protected class sizes.  We did not worsen pupil-teacher ratios in any of the budgets we introduced.  Even in the teeth of the crisis we protected them and have now improved them.  With the very first easement of pressure on us, we improved the pupil-teacher ratios, the result of which will be an additional 2,260 teachers next year.  On the quality of the school environment which is equally important, on the capital side we have prioritised investment in schools.  We built schools in the worst of times.</p></speech>

The core of this fiscal rule is the medium-term objective to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms, whereby allowances are made for once-off temporary factors and the impact of the economic cycle on the public finances.  Compliance with the medium-term objective will require improvement in the structural budget at a rate greater than 0.5% of GDP each year until the medium-term objective is achieved. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is very well aware, the second pillar of the fiscal rules relates to the expenditure benchmark which supports the achievement of the medium-term objective by explicitly setting the rate, aligned to the estimated potential growth rate of the economy, at which aggregate public expenditure can grow, other than when the relevant expenditure is funded through discretionary revenue measures.</p>  <p>  From next year onwards, increases in overall general Government expenditure must be based on the requirements of these pillars of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  This is the law.  The ministerial expenditure ceilings for next year have been set in a context that will deliver on this objective.  From 2016, this means that additional resources in excess of these ceilings may only be allocated in a manner that is consistent with the pact.  Consequently, unplanned expenditure leading to Supplementary Estimates from 2016 may not be met by additional revenue arising from the economic cycle but rather would need to be met through expenditure savings, efficiencies elsewhere or additional taxes. </p>  <p>  The current estimates of the gross and net fiscal space for the period to 2021 were set out in the budgetary tables on budget day.  These estimates are not final but comprise forecasts based on the number of projections, including GDP deflators, benchmark reference rates and convergence margins forecast by the Department of Finance for each of the years beyond 2016.  The actual deflator, reference rate and convergence margin values used by the Commission to assess compliance with the rules each year beyond next year will be based on its estimates as set out in the forecast in each relevant year.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance documents on budget day indicated a &euro;500 million fiscal space would be available in 2017.  I have never seen a document produced by the Government on fiscal space which has ever turned out to be anywhere within &euro;1 billion of the actual mark.  We will take this remark as genuine in so far as it was made, in the full knowledge that nobody ever expects it actually to happen.  Will the Minister give us the actual rate for the growth about which we are speaking?</p><p>It used to be a ten year average and we are told it has changed.

His criticism is that we have done better than we expected every time we made a projection.  Had we erred on the other side, the country, as well as the Deputy, would have something even stronger to say.  We have been prudent and, perhaps, overly conservative in estimating the pace of recovery.  We have an additional &euro;2 billion in tax revenue over what we forecast for this year.  It is not once-off.  We are 70,000 shy of 2 million people at work.  Next year, we will have more than 2 million in work.  It is a permanent feature of the economy, please God.  As the Deputy saw in the plan we published last week, we intend to have an additional third of a million more people in work over the coming years.  This will generate additional revenue.  It is not once-off.  It can be used to deal with the expenditure pressures we have discussed.  The Deputy should not talk about windfall or once-off money.  The Revenue has indicated that the corporation tax is not a once-off.</p></speech>

The biggest element of the extra tax that came in this year was corporation tax, of which 80% comes from the multinational sector.  Nobody in the Government has any control over what cheque the multinationals feel like writing here to suit their global requirements.  Although it is out of our control, the Minister is factoring it into future plans.  When the figures came out, the Department of Finance officials said they could not fully explain them.</p>  <p>  Given the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, if France needs a Supplementary Estimate next year to deal with the crisis, is the Minister saying EU rules will not allow it to happen?  Is he saying if various European countries need additional funds to deal with the immigration crisis, the EU rules will prevent it from happening?  Let us be real.  Every expenditure ceiling the Government introduced here was made redundant the next time it was examined.  While there are rules, how flexible are they when push comes to shove?</p></speech>

Many corporations want to ensure they are very solid regarding it and it is a new and welcome paradigm in corporation tax payment.  Given that we are a very clear and transparent country regarding the rate of corporation tax we pay, more and more companies will decide to pay their corporation tax in Ireland, and it will be a permanent feature.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question whether the Stability and Growth Pact rules are flexible enough is very valid.  Like everything in the EU, it will be a matter for discussion.  The Deputy asked a very relevant question, whether France would be allowed to break the rules in order to provide for the security of the state.  Personally, I think France will do it.  We must address it at European level.  We want to apply the rules because they make sense but they must also be flexible enough to deal with issues such as those the Deputy has set out.</p></speech>

Public procurement is governed by well-established EU and national rules and guidelines.  The aim of the rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  EU directives on public procurement require that public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For works contracts, the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments, the threshold is &euro;134,000; and for the remainder of public bodies, the threshold is &euro;207,000.  The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors such as water, energy, transport and postal services is &euro;414,000.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website,<i></i>or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.</p><p>In line with this, the following national rules apply to below EU threshold procurements.  Supplies or services costing less than &euro;5,000 in value may be purchased on the basis of verbal quotes from one or more competing suppliers.  Contracts for supplies or services between &euro;5,000 and &euro;25,000 in value should be awarded on the basis of responses to specifications sent by fax or e-mail to at least three suppliers or service providers.  Goods and general services with an expected value of &euro;25,000 or more should be advertised on the eTenders website while for ICT procurements, the expected value is &euro;10,000 or more.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure they comply with EU and national rules in relation to public procurement.</p></reply>

The office is responsible for delivering shared services projects in the Civil Service and for the operation of Civil Service shared service centres.  As one of the key priorities set out in the public service reform plan, I established the Office of Government Procurement in July 2013.</p><p><font color="#181818">The Government, as part of the sale of the lottery licence and as set out in the National Lottery Act 2013, established the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery, which is under the remit of this Department.  The overarching function of the regulator is to ensure that the national lottery is run with all due propriety, the interests of participants in the lottery are protected, and the long-term sustainability of the lottery is safeguarded.  Subject to this, an additional function is to ensure that revenue for good causes is maximised.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  As I have stated previously, State agencies play an important and legitimate part in implementing and advising on Government policy and delivering public services, including economic regulation, consumer protection, road safety, industrial relations and a host of other services in support of citizens and businesses.  They are an established part of the modern state and will continue to feature prominently in the Irish administrative system.  It is essential that this occur in a structured and coherent manner, that it not repeat the unplanned and sporadic growth of the past and that agencies' impact and performance be understood, reviewed and managed.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  One element in the updated code of practice for governance of State bodies includes a periodic critical review ensuring that the ongoing business case for State bodies, including those newly established, will be subject to periodic scrutiny and assessment.</font></p></speech>

I asked the Minister the number of State agencies that have been established.  He made no attempt to answer that.  I am complaining to the Ceann Comhairle and I ask him to help me, as a Member, to get an answer on Question Time.  I asked about the number of agencies subject to a sunset clause but the Minister chose not to even deal with the issue.  To my first question this morning, on the Supplementary Estimates across various Departments, he made no attempt to answer.</p>  <p>  I have tabled a couple of questions today and there has been no attempt whatsoever to answer them.  What is the point in coming in here to listen to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform?  When I asked him about additional expenditure in Supplementary Estimates across Departments - some of which are listed on the Order Paper today but without figures - he made no attempt to deal with it.  On my second question, about the number of agencies, he has made no effort whatsoever to answer or deal with the issue of sunset clauses.  Frankly, it is a waste of time asking this Minister questions because he is refusing to answer them.  He either does not know the answer or is refusing to give it.  Answer the question.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle knows that, even on the second attempt to respond by the Minister, there was still no reference to the sunset clause issue.  The phrase has not come out of the Minister's mouth here today.  I expect that he will probably answer on the third attempt and I look forward to receiving that answer.  The Minister is responsible for public expenditure and reform and the public service generally.  He and the Taoiseach issued a document last year on how he was reforming the public service.  If he is telling me he is not answerable for the public service other than for the few officials in his Department, he should say so and change the title of his Department to reflect his responsibilities.</p></speech>

He knows the rules and normally asks questions seeking information in tabular form.  I will happily answer questions on areas for which I am responsible.  However, if the Deputy wants to ask specifically about legislation brought through this House to establish other agencies or bodies by my ministerial colleagues, he knows full well he must ask those Ministers.  That is how this House has always operated.  Therefore, let us not pretend the Deputy is in total ignorance as to how the House operates.  He is a wily enough operator and knows full well that what I say is the case.  I have answered in regard to the areas for which I have responsibility.</p>  <p>  The shared service centres will be a permanent feature of public administration.  They are proving to be very good.  The Office of Government Procurement will be a permanent feature of public administration.

Ireland's expenditure on public services is currently 16.9% of GDP while the mean in Europe is 21.6%.  We are actually near the bottom of the scale.</p></reply>

Reflecting these considerations, trends in public capital investment should preferably be examined over a much more extended time horizon.  In this regard, the ESRI which is regarded as the definitive examiner of these matters has reviewed investment levels in EU member states over more than four decades, from 1970 to 2013.  It has found that Ireland ranks third behind Sweden and the Netherlands in terms of state investment in national infrastructure as a share of GDP. </p> <p> The Government's capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investments 2016-2021, announced an Exchequer capital spend of &euro;27 billion in the next six years.  Supplementing Exchequer-funded investment with investment planned from the wider semi-State sector and PPPs means that total State investment will amount to &euro;42 billion in the next six years.  At the time of publication of the capital plan, State-backed capital investment, therefore, constituted a forecasted average of 3.5% of GDP per annum over the relevant period.</p></speech>

Research carried out by Michael Taaffe who, I understand, is a member of the Minister's party shows that we will run into trouble if we do not start investing more in infrastructure.  The Minister is well aware of the fact that there is a housing crisis and the lack of direct investment in social housing means that the crisis is not being dealt with.  We have to re-examine the problem because we will not solve it until we are prepared to engage in much more extensive investment in infrastructure.</p></speech>

Social housing was a feature of the budget I introduced 13 months ago.  At that stage we allocated in excess of &euro;2.2 billion for housing and re-established the spend on social housing for the first time in almost a decade.  The previous Government did not believe in building social housing, preferring instead to buy it from developers, but we have reoriented public policy to ensure we will build social housing.  The Deputy is uniquely equipped in the House to know that it takes a lead-in time to do this.  We have to acquire land, make sure it is serviced and obtain planning permission, ensure tenders and builders on site, all of which takes from 18 months to two years.  I agree totally with the Deputy that social housing provision is one of the most demanding social issues and it is a priority for capital investment.</p></speech>

The Government is not getting local authorities to build large numbers of social housing units, even though this is absolutely essential.</p>  <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Sean Fleming, the Minister said France might break the rules in order to deal with its defence and security challenges.  There is a housing emergency in Ireland.  The idea that we cannot borrow money off the books to invest in social housing because it is outside EU rules needs to be challenged.  It is outrageous that we are paying PPPs at a rate in the region of 15%, when the Government can access money at less than 2% when it sells Government bonds.  That could be done in order to invest in an extensive social housing programme.</p></speech>

It is simple to rejig local authorities back into providing housing because that capacity was hollowed out of them for the past ten years.  I spoke to housing officers, including those in our county.  There was an annual trawl to find the correct sites and make sure they were serviced.  There were a number of local authority estates to be built and so on.  All of this evaporated, but we are putting it back in place.  One of the first things I did last year was to remove any embargo on the hiring of key people at local authority level in order to do that.  Change will not be instant, but once things are back in shape local authorities will be a very regular provider of social housing.</p>  <p>  We are examining a variety of ways to deal with the issue, including but not limited to direct capital investment.  There is no shortage of money.  Rather, the problem is having the money spent on bricks to build houses.  As the Deputy said, we also have PPPs to supplement this and I have devoted a special purpose vehicle, with a total figure of &euro;400 million from the sale of BGE, for social housing.  We are developing ways to utilise this and ongoing discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are taking place.</p>  <p>  On fiscal rules, they are in place for a purpose, namely, to stop countries being profligate and destroying their economies by not having prudent expenditure profiles into the future.  In a way, the Deputies are correct.  The rules have yet to bed down and have to be tweaked and examined.  Whoever is in government after the next general election will have a job of work to do to address that issue.  We have already made submissions to the Commission on infrastructural needs that might be excluded from the fiscal space calculations.  It is a dramatic work in progress.</p></speech>

The Wild Atlantic Way brand has successfully grabbed the imagination of many visitors to Ireland and proved to be a very popular proposition for attract tourists.  The OPW manages in excess of 716 national monument and heritage sites, a significant number of which are located on the route to which the Deputy referred.  We are all familiar with sites such as Newgrange which attract large numbers and where the OPW provides a range of visitor services.  However, on many more sites in State care these services are not provided and the majority of the monuments are in their natural state in the Irish countryside, a significant proportion of which are to be found on the route of the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>  <p>  Understanding that a large proportion of visitors who come to Ireland want to experience cultural and heritage sites, the relevant agencies involved, namely, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the OPW, are working actively together on a plan to better promote the Wild Atlantic Way.  This project has as its objective the better promotion of the Wild Atlantic Way's heritage sites and will seek to promote them coherently within each of the six F&aacute;ilte Ireland zones which have been created for the purposes of marketing this important route.</p>  <p>  The three agencies are working to examine all of the Wild Atlantic Way sites to establish what is available for visitors at the locations concerned and how the sites might be made more attractive to tourists.  In broad terms, what is emerging through the study is that there is a series of "bundles" or "clusters" of sites which represent possibilities to enrich the visitor or tourist experience, drawing them into less visited parts of the country and keeping them there longer, with consequent benefits for local economies.</p><p>These offerings will be promoted internationally in targeted markets by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its sister organisation, Tourism Ireland.  The project is being actively pursued by the three organisations involved in an ongoing process that will continually be updated and redeveloped.</p></speech>

The Wild Atlantic Way route touches my county of Limerick, where we have OPW sites in the west of the county, in Askeaton, Adare and Newcastle West.  On the other side of the county and in the context of the Ireland's Ancient East initiative, we have sites in Kilmallock and Lough Gur.  Having holidayed at home this year, it seems the Wild Atlantic Way is really just a set of signposts, albeit an imaginative one.  That signage has succeeded in drawing people into parts of country they might not otherwise visit.  However, there are other sites close to roads used by hundreds of thousands of visitors, but these visitors may not even know they are there.  We need to box clever in this regard by, for example, using new technologies.  There is no doubt that when it comes to restoration and conservation, nobody does it like the Office of Public Works.  It does a fantastic job.  There remains a job to do, however, in telling people where particular sites are located and encouraging them to visit them.  In many cases, they are free to enter and the visitor experience is fantastic.  We must do more in the area of promotion.  I encourage the Minister, through the OPW and in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to avail of this massive opportunity, particularly in the counties through which the Ireland's Ancient East route will pass.</p></speech>

The success of the Wild Atlantic Way took all of us, even F&aacute;ilte Ireland, by surprise.  It was a good idea which was marketed very well.  In the aftermath of The Gathering, it was a question of finding the next big idea and that big idea has been extraordinarily successful.  We now need to consider how we can capitalise on it.  Identification, notification, postering and proper preparation of sites are all essential and that work is ongoing, as I indicated.  I would welcome suggestions the Deputy might have in this regard and will pass them on to the OPW.</p></speech>

They have seen increases in the number of visitors, including in my area.  Staff have told me that one issue the office could look at is that of new technologies.  For many visitors arriving in the country, one of the first things they want to do is download an app showing local visitor attractions.  The provision of that type of application might be a more cost-effective way to go than riddling the country with more signs.  Having said that, the Wild Atlantic Way initiative has, as I said, been innovative in its use of road signs from County Cork to County Donegal.  That could be very easily enhanced by the OPW.  There is a great willingness on the part of local authorities which will all be knocking on the Minister's door to seek an increased allocation from the local government fund to become involved in these initiatives.  There is a great deal of potential in the case of the Ireland's Ancient East region which includes the Minister's county.  Having used the Wild Atlantic Way route through County Donegal during the summer and having spoken to people there, it clearly has made a massive difference o a lot of local communities that heretofore did not have the benefit of this type of tourism product.  I realise Newgrange, Dublin Castle and places like them are at the pinnacle of the OPW's portfolio, but there are hundreds of fantastic sites around the country with excellent guides who are only waiting to greet visitors on behalf of the OPW.</p></speech>

Ensuring there is proper road-sign planning and signage and developing a sophisticated app are not mutually exclusive endeavours.  We need to do both.  Some people like to plan their tourism route in detail, in which case an app would be very useful.  Others are more opportunistic, will see a sign and decide to visit a place.  We do not want people to sail past particular locations because they do not know there is a monument or heritage site of some significance on that route.  If people have a spare hour or half an hour, they might decide to have a look and could well discover a gem.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for mentioning the Ireland's Ancient East initiative.  It is less developed as a concept than the Wild Atlantic Way and more work needs to be done on it.  It is a little higgledy-piggledy in terms of its connectivity, for instance, but I am confident that tourists will embrace it.  Ireland's unique selling point is its heritage, culture and tradition which one cannot find in some sun destinations and other places with which we are competing for the holiday euro or dollar.</p></speech>

The terms that should apply in the case of redundancy of public servants are set out in Collective Agreement: Redundancy Payments to Public Servants, which was agreed between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in June 2012. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for deciding whether to offer a voluntary redundancy scheme in a particular agency rests, in the first instance, with the agency and its parent Department.  In the event that these bodies consider it appropriate to offer voluntary redundancy, sanction for the financial terms of the scheme should be sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is expected that agencies will make sure they are satisfied that the non-financial terms of any scheme are in compliance with any legal requirement and that they will seek legal advice to the extent appropriate to the circumstances of the case.  The advice of my Department is sought on myriad issues, but I am not aware of an instance of the nature referred to by the Deputy being raised with my Department in recent times.  If the Deputy has a specific instance in mind, she might let me have the details and I can arrange for further inquiries to be made.  </p>  <p>  I understand section 13 of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 render void a provision in any agreement which purports to exclude or limit the application of any provision of these Acts, although case law provides that section 13 does not preclude employers and employees from compromising a claim under the Acts, provided the employee has given "full and informed consent".   I further understand the Labour Court has held that in order for a settlement or compromise agreement to be upheld, the terms of any waiver must be construed strictly against the party from which it emanated, any agreement to waive statutory rights must be supported by adequate consideration and the waiver should arise from an agreement reached after meaningful negotiations and professional advice has been sought and given.</p></reply>

Consequently, it is not for me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to set out a separate policy for public sector contracts.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure contracts are awarded to compliant businesses through the standard procedures contained in the procurement process.</p>  <p>  The public works contracts make provision for certain contractual remedies where a contractor's or a subcontractor's workers have not been paid in accordance with statutory requirements.  The contracts also permit deductions to be made from payments in accordance with the legislation governing taxation.  Health and safety legislation is also underlined and enforced throughout the contract enshrining legal requirements as conditions of contract to ensure serious health and safety breaches may be relied on as breach of contract leading to termination.</p>  <p>  These are in addition to the remedies contained in law which are enforced by the appropriate statutory bodies which possess the necessary powers to investigate and to bring proceedings.</p></reply>

I have put down several questions recently to line Departments about their role and the role of the OGP in awarding contracts.  A line Department will say it is working in consultation with the OGP while the OGP says it is working with the line Department.  There is a circular flow with everyone involved but nobody willing to say who is responsible.  This is an issue that will have to be sorted out.  I do not mind who is responsible as long as somebody is responsible.</p>  <p>  It is ironic that we spent years discussing the Construction Contracts Act to ensure contractors would be paid.  The Minister dealt with it for years and then fobbed it off to his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash.  However, it is still not implemented which is a shame.  The Minister of State was to appoint a panel of adjudication which was to go to the Public Appointments Service.  I have been informed he has breached the law by picking a chairman unilaterally without having appointed a panel.  I am told this could be subject to difficulties down the road.</p></speech>

That responsibility has moved to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I will talk to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, to check about its status, which the Deputy raised again.

Social clauses have been included in the contracts we have done under the stimulus package.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Government supports the use of social clauses in a manner which can address issues such as social exclusion, long-term unemployment or provide enhanced opportunities through the provision of training.</font></p><p>While Government is convinced of the merit in using social clauses in particular circumstances, contracting authorities should not be compelled to use them on every contract since their deployment may disproportionately impact on SME's bidding for public contracts.  They are used to best effect in a targeted fashion to tackle the identified causes of inequity or deprivation.</p><p>In order to ensure that social clauses do not discriminate, it is best to use general categories of beneficiary, for example, long-term unemployed, trainees and target the social benefits through supply-side activities such as training and job-matching services.  Targeted social clauses are likely to be most effective in cases where they are actively supported by supply-side actions and by monitoring and evaluation processes taken by the public body with the relevant policy remit.  The inclusion of social clauses imposes additional costs to the State and suppliers in meeting the requirements and demonstrating and verifying compliance.  It is imperative that such provisions are enforced and independently verified; do not adversely affect value for money; do not place additional costs on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and are only applied to contracts of a minimum scale so that they do not disadvantage SMEs.</p><p>Unemployment in the construction sector increased in inverse proportion to the decline in activity from 2008.  In response, Government set out a range of actions in Construction 2020 aimed at increasing activity and has introduced a number of stimulus packages to increase activity and employment in the sector.  Social clauses are included in the various contracts awarded under the PPP element of the &euro;2.25 billion package announced in July 2012.  These clauses require a minimum percentage of the time required to deliver the contract to be undertaken by those recruited from the ranks of the long term unemployed and apprentices.</p><p>The operation of this clause has already been successfully piloted and local Intreo offices have worked closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative.</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement is currently developing guidance on the inclusion of social clauses more broadly in tender and contract documentation.</p></reply>

As the tragic events in Paris last week have starkly illustrated, international co-operation and mutual assistance between police authorities in member states and outside of the EU is becoming increasingly important.  Criminals and terrorists do not operate within the boundaries of any international borders and it is absolutely essential that measures to tackle criminality and terrorism also operate across these borders.</p>  <p>  This Bill amends the existing Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act of 2008.  That Act already gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework relating to the provision of mutual legal assistance.  This Bill is necessary in order to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act.  These are international instruments which have already been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for a number of enhancements to existing legislation.  It provides for Ireland to provide assistance to other member states in the form of special intervention units to assist another state, on request, in dealing with crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat such as terrorist incidents.  Assistance can take the form of the provision of equipment, expertise or direct assistance in the territory of the requesting member state, if requested.  Any specialist units would operate under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting member state but would only be able to operate within the limits of their own national powers.  As the recent tragic events in Paris have shown, we cannot know whether we may be asked in the future by another state to provide such assistance and it is important to have a legal basis in place to enable us to respond to such requests.  </p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for the strengthening of the role of Eurojust in exchanging intelligence information about criminality in the EU.  Eurojust is an EU agency based in The Hague dealing with judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  The Bill will also allow fines imposed by courts in one member state to be collected in another member state where the person concerned resides in or is a citizen of that state.  This provision will apply to any fine imposed which is appealable to a criminal court.  </p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their support for this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900012#K00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015.  For many decades health insurance has operated alongside our public health service and has grown and developed.  Health insurance in Ireland is based on a core principle of community rating.  All policy holders are charged the same premium for a particular plan which is adjusted to reflect any loadings applicable under lifetime community rating, irrespective of their age, gender or health status. </p><p>This system of health insurance requires intergenerational solidarity whereby younger and healthier people effectively subsidise older and less healthy people.  The understanding is that these younger people will themselves be subsidised by later generations when they reach old age or suffer ill health.  The risk equalisation scheme is essential to the operation of community rated health insurance.  Its purpose, and the purpose of this annual update to the scheme, is to ensure that health insurance is affordable for older people and those with a chronic disease and not just for the young and the healthy.  </p><p>Risk equalisation is a process that aims to neutralise in an equitable manner differences in health insurers&rsquo; costs that arise due to variations in the health status of their members.  The risk equalisation scheme is designed to protect community rating and make it easier for older and less well people to afford health insurance.  The scheme operates by compensating insurers for some of the additional costs of insuring older and less healthy members.  Insurers receive risk equalisation credits for insured members funded by a levy payable by health insurers on all contracts written.</p><p>Amending legislation is required each year to revise the support provided under the scheme.  The last 12 months saw a number of changes to health insurance.  In July this year, VHI Healthcare was regulated as an authorised company by the Central Bank of Ireland in line with the regulatory position of the three other health insurers.  This is a significant achievement by VHI and it is a vote of confidence in the health insurance sector and the improved economy in which it operates.  </p><p>To be able to continue to offer affordable health insurance to older and sicker people, health insurers require a steady influx of younger healthy people.  It is clear that the economic downturn had a significant negative impact on the number and age profile of the insured population.  The number of policyholders fell from just under 2.3 million at the end of 2008 to just more than 2 million in 2014.  In response to the decline, the Government introduced two important initiatives from May of this year.  These are lifetime community rating and young adult discounts.  These measures work to secure the future viability of community rating and protect access to affordable health insurance.  </p><p>Encouraging more people to take out health insurance at younger ages helps to spread costs across all policyholders and ensures affordable premiums for all insured people.  Without these necessary measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and higher insurance premiums.  Under lifetime community rating, late entry loadings apply for those aged 35 and over who buy health insurance for the first time.  This is applied at a rate of 2% per year.  Some 74,000 people avoided loadings by taking out health insurance before the deadline of 1 May 2015. </p><p>Young adult discounts are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to the age of 26.  This new approach helps to ensure the smooth phasing in of full adult rates and eases the effect of dramatic price increases experienced when student rates no longer apply.  The vast majority of policies now held by consumers aged 21 to 26 years offer young adult rates.  These rates range from 51% of the full adult rate at age 21 to a 100% rate at age 26.</p><p>These two measures aim to increase the number of younger people with health insurance as well as retaining those who already have policies.  I welcome the significant growth in the number of people with health insurance over the past 12 months, which saw an increase in membership of 100,000.  I want to keep health insurance remains affordable for all those who wish to avail of it.  </p><p>As a necessary support to community rating, I am committed to making risk equalisation schemes as effective as possible in a way that promotes fair and open competition.  The risk equalisation scheme has operated in Ireland since 1 January 2013.  The scheme is funded by stamp duties levied on health insurance policies payable by open market insurers for each policy written.  The money generated is used to pay risk equalisation credits to take account of the higher costs of insuring older and sicker people.  Currently the scheme provides credits based on age and gender and a utilisation credit based on an overnight stay in hospital of &euro;90<font color="#0082BF">.  </font></p><p>From 1 March 2016, the credits payable in respect of age and gender for those aged 65 and over on policies written from that date will be increased.  However, I propose to set credits for the 60 to 64 age group at zero, which will also come into effect from 1 March 2016.  It is not only older people who have high claims so I remain committed to developing a refined health status measure in the risk equalisation scheme using data based on diagnosis related groups, DRGs.  This will require the collection and coding of all hospital activity data for both public and private hospitals under the system overseen by the Healthcare Pricing Office.  Structural and legal changes will be required over time.</p><p>The immediate priority for the Healthcare Pricing Office is to provide the main technical support for implementation of activity based funding, ABF, in public hospitals.  The conversion year for the new funding system is 2016, which will see hospital budgets translated into ABF allocations for the first time.  In the meantime I want to improve the health status measure that we do have.  In addition to the overnight credit of &euro;90 I propose to expand the setting in which utilisation credits will be payable to include day case admissions.  These will be paid at a lower rate of &euro;30.  This enhancement to the scheme will increase the support provided for less healthy people of all ages.  Providing a utilisation credit reflects the fact that 30% of hospital inpatient activity for insured members is now carried out on a day case basis.  It will also incentivise clinically appropriate treatment on a day case basis, freeing up overnight accommodation for those who need it.  </p><p>Under the scheme, health insurers receive risk equalisation credits from the risk equalisation fund to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members.  The credits are funded by stamp duty levies payable by open market insurers for each policy written.  The stamp duty levies are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the fund which is administered by the Health Insurance Authority.  </p><p>In previous years, it has been necessary to increase significantly the stamp duty on all policies in order to fund the rising costs of an older and less healthy population of insured people.  Last year, in order to make health insurance more affordable, I took the decision to reduce the stamp duty rates for non- advanced products by &euro;50 per adult and &euro;20 per child to 60% of the rate for advanced products.  At the same time there was no increase to the rates for advanced products.  I am pleased to confirm that the levy on the lower-level products will be reduced again in 2016 to 50% of the rate for advanced products, down by &euro;38 per adult to &euro;202 and down by &euro;13 per child to &euro;67.  There will be a slight increase of &euro;4 per adult to &euro;403 for advanced products and a reduction of &euro;1 to &euro;134 in the case of children.</p><p>The decision to set credits at zero for those aged under 65 was taken primarily on the basis that retention of credits for this age group would have led to an increase in stamp duty by approximately &euro;34 for everyone holding health insurance.  I believe the credits and levy rates proposed for 2016 strike a fair balance between the need to sustain community rating and the need to ensure that younger people continue to avail of health insurance.  The credits proposed by the Health Insurance Authority do not fully compensate for the cost of insuring older and less healthy people.  The risk equalisation scheme benefits all consumers by encouraging insurers to compete on the basis of value for money, customer service and product design, rather than competing on the basis of risk segmentation.  This approach supports a fair and open competition, giving those who wish to avail of health insurance access to a range of affordable policies from which to choose regardless of their age or health status.</p><p>I turn now to the Bill.  The main purpose of this Bill is to specify the amount of premium to be paid from the risk equalisation fund in respect of age, gender and level of cover from 1 March 2016 and revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2016.  The Bill provides for consequential amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  A technical amendment to the Health Insurance Acts is also included.  I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 1<i></i>defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 amends section 6A(1) of the principal Act by the proposed amendment of three definitions.  In section 2(1)(a), the proposed amendment replaces the current definition of hospital bed utilisation credit or HBUC with a definition of &quot;hospital utilisation credit&quot;.  The scheme provides for a HBUC as a proxy for health status.  Currently, health insurers receive a retrospective payment of &euro;90 per night for an overnight stay in hospital by one of its members.  The proposed amendment will expand this credit to include day case inpatient admissions.  The HBUC payment will be replaced with a hospital utilisation credit.  Under this, credit insurers will receive a payment from the fund for day case inpatient admissions and for inpatient admissions on an overnight basis on all policies written on or after 1 March 2016.<br/><br/>Section 2(1)(b) proposes a technical amendment to the definition of private hospital accommodation.  The amendment reflects the enactment of section 55 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, where private patients incur a hospital charge in respect of inpatient services provided in a public hospital.  Section (2)(1)(c) amends the definition of &quot;relevant amount&quot; to include day case inpatient admissions in the calculation of the hospital utilisation credit.<br/><br/>Section 3 amends section 11C of the principal Act.  It provides for 1 March 2016 as the effective date for revised risk equalisation credits to be payable from the risk equalisation fund.<br/><br/>Section 4 amends Schedule 3 of the principal Act.  It provides for the amounts payable from the risk equalisation fund for the hospital utilisation credit in respect of health insurance contracts renewed or effected from 1 March 2016.  Schedule 3 will now contain two amounts, one for the provision of inpatient services on an overnight basis and one for the provision of inpatient services on a day case basis.<br/><br/>Section 5 replaces Table 2 in Schedule 4 of the principal Act with effect from 1 March 2016.  The applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund for certain classes of insured persons are revised.  Section 6 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  It specifies the applicable stamp duty rates from 1 January to 29 February 2016 and from 1 March 2016 on.  Section 7<i></i>provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill.<br/><br/>Given the other events of the week, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the broader issue of health reform and the move towards universal health care.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to introducing a system of universal health care in the State.  That means access to affordable, quality and effective health care for everybody in a timely manner and in a way they can afford.  Our preferred funding model is to use a system of health insurance whereby everybody will be insured.  We must look at different models, including single-payer and multi-payer models, to assess how that can be done best in the years ahead.  However, it is clear that if we are genuine about achieving universal health care we must put the building blocks in place first.  If a new service is to work, it must be built on sound foundations.  This will require four foundation stones - Healthy Ireland and the public health agenda; sufficient capacity to satisfy unmet demand; the expansion and development of primary and social care; and reformed structures, ICT and financial systems.<br/><br/>When considering vision and policy for the future we should always start with Healthy Ireland, the Government-led programme to improve our personal and public health.  It is the best way to ensure that we all live longer and healthier lives and the best way to tackle rising health costs in the long term.  We have made great progress on smoking and now we must have a similar focus on alcohol misuse, obesity and physical inactivity.  Last week I launched our sexual health strategy and I look forward to publishing our first public health legislation on alcohol in the next few weeks.  It will go to the Cabinet next month.<br/><br/>For too long health and wellness programmes have been seen as important but not critical and have, therefore, often been overlooked when additional resources were being allocated.  We must change that by making a commitment to increase the total budget for Healthy Ireland and the HSE health and well-being programme every year by more than the average increase in health spending.  Important evidence-based initiatives, including the extension of screening and the childhood vaccination programmes, cannot wait until some point in the future when every immediate issue has first been dealt with.  The same applies to programmes such as smoking cessation and other public health campaigns and programmes.  The required additional funding could be sourced by ring-fencing the proceeds of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks or excise on cigarettes. <br/><br/>With the current staffing levels of specialist doctors, general practitioners, GPs, midwives, specialist nurses, allied health care professionals, critical care beds and other capacity, no system of universal health care introduced immediately or in the near future will be able to deal with unmet demand.  We must get a clear fix on the workforce requirements across the health service now and into the future.  I have initiated a process to prepare a clear plan within 12 months.  We must then work to fund it and implement it over a number of years.  We must also reassess the number of acute hospital beds we require.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, statistics indicate that the number of hospital beds we have is low relative to other countries but this does not take into account private hospitals to which half of the population have access.  OECD numbers also indicate that we use our public hospital beds relatively efficiently, with a short average length of stay.<br/><br/>No matter how much one reforms the service, unless the necessary resources and capacity are in place, there will always be long waiting times and potential overcrowding.  An under-resourced system of universal health care which puts everyone on a lengthy waiting list, albeit everyone waiting for the same length of time, does not have much appeal.  At the same time, no matter how much money one has, it will never be enough if one does not spend it well and efficiently, hence the need for the organisational and financial reforms which we are undertaking.  On a positive note, in 2015 we secured the first budget increase in seven years for the health service.  We anticipate that the service will spend &euro;700 million more this year than it did last year.  A further increase was secured in the recent budget for next year.  The increases have allowed the health service to take on or regularise 4,000 more staff and to fund new treatment programmes.  None the less, it is still operating with approximately 10,000 fewer staff than was the case at the peak, and since then our population has grown and aged further.  Based on a clear vision and a solid commitment to adequate resources, we can put in place the foundation stones of a reformed service.<br/><br/>The key challenge for the Government is to find a way to deliver universal health care at a cost that is affordable and sustainable.  This cannot be achieved without refocusing our health service from a hospital-led model of care to one that is more preventative, a less acute model that is grounded in more comprehensive and developed primary and social care.  We must continue to strengthen and enhance primary care provision in Ireland through the ongoing development of comprehensive chronic disease management programmes.  We are already showing form in this regard, with better asthma care written into the new contract for children under six years of age and a new diabetes contract for GPs, alongside better access to ultrasound and a GP minor surgery pilot.  Nearly 14,000 children have registered for the asthma cycle of care since the middle of this year and 37,000 patients have registered for the diabetes cycle of care.<br/><br/>I look forward to concluding discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on further extending the scope of, and access to, general practice in the new year.  As part of the new contract, I hope to see more GPs encouraged to provide expanded services such as chronic disease management, minor procedures and first-line investigations like 24-hour blood pressure and cardiac monitoring.  However, I have no wish to see GPs becoming <i>de facto</i>public servants, entirely dependent on the State for their income.  Their autonomy and business-orientated approach are among the factors that make general practice work.  As part of the negotiation with GPs, the State will seek to continue the implementation of GP care without fees on a phased basis, with the next phase bringing in all children up to 12 years of age and thereafter children up to 18 years of age.<br/><br/>In July this year, we took the first step in realising timely access to safe and quality health care for everyone with the extension of GP services without fees to 270,000 children under the age of six and an enhanced and better funded service for 150,000 children under six who already have a medical or doctor visit card.  The second step came in August with the inclusion of another 36,000 people aged 70 or older.  Of course, we should never make the mistake of thinking that primary care is just about GPs.  Dentists, therapists, nurses, community midwives and psychologists play an increasingly important role.  For example, we identified in the recent budget the importance of prioritising resources for speech and language therapy.</p><p>Community pharmacists are enthusiastic to do more and to manage patients as well as dispense prescriptions, and we should aid them to do more, for example, to manage minor ailments, administer more vaccines and do more medicine management and monitoring.  We need to develop social care provision so that people, especially our elderly, can stay in their homes or supported housing with care for longer rather than in nursing homes.  Modern technology will allow more people to stay at home for longer and nursing homes should enhance the level of nursing and medical care they provide to avoid unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p> <p> To deliver reform it is necessary to be clear about the architecture one is seeking to build.  The HSE is far too large and far too remote from the front line.  It has been successful in some of its national functions, such as models of care, national clinical programmes and the national ambulance service.  However, the centralised command and control model is not conducive to good management of hospitals or community services.  It makes accountability almost impossible and will have to be dismantled over time and replaced with new structures that will devolve more decision-making to the level of the hospital or community and ensure greater accountability.</p> <p> International evidence demonstrates that well-designed commissioning approaches and payment systems may have the potential to increase transparency, drive efficiency and encourage the provision of quality integrated care at the lowest level of cost.  A new health commission could be established based upon a re-shaping of the existing responsibilities and expertise in the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, but also, crucially, with the input of new people who bring additional skills.  The commission would purchase services from hospital groups and community health organisations.</p> <p> The development of commissioning will require the establishment of the health care pricing office on a statutory footing, although it already exists on a non-statutory basis.  It will be independent of commissioners and service providers in order to develop objective pricing mechanisms and determine standard national prices.  It will also require the extension of coding and costing beyond the hospital walls to allow, where appropriate, more to be done in primary and social care settings.  Most important of all, it will be necessary to drive the introduction of activity-based funding, ABF, for public patients in public hospitals, while also developing a complementary system of case-based charging for private patients in public hospitals.  The conversation year for ABF is 2016 and hospital budgets for the first time will be based on this principle.  It means money will follow the patient or service user, and hospitals and other health care providers will be funded for the work they do and the outcomes they deliver, rather than being funded on the basis of historic budgets.  It will mean that hospitals and community health care organisations are incentivised and paid more to do more work, whether that involves more hip operations, more home help hours or more dermatology clinics.</p> <p> In my view, linking spending to activity is the biggest single reform that will make the most difference for the better in our health service from the point of view of patients and taxpayers.  Much work has already been undertaken and more can and will be done over the next five years on this crucial initiative.  However, the commissioning approach will only work if the new health service is capable of responding to the introduction of stronger incentives.  Therefore, a major reorganisation of health care delivery structures is underway, with the aim of strengthening local responsibility, accountability and responsiveness.  This involves the transformation of all HSE and voluntary hospitals into seven major hospital groups, each of which will develop a strategic plan describing how they will operate as a cohesive entity which delivers safe, high quality and cost effective health care.  I am strongly of the view that hospital groups should be truly autonomous to the extent that any body or organisation funded mainly by public money can be.  The hospital groups, or trusts if one prefers, should also have the authority and freedom to make collective agreements, manage their own assets and payroll and negotiate independent contracts to recruit managers and specialists outside of the constraints of public sector rules, which in many ways are tying the hands of the health service when it comes to recruiting the right people.</p> <p> Voluntary hospitals have made a valuable contribution to the development of health services in Ireland down the years.  I value their ethos and history and, where their financial affairs are in order, it is our intention to retain their boards and governance.  Where earned, their autonomy will be expanded, provided they fulfil contracts or service level agreements with their hospital group or trust.  Voluntary hospitals may come together to lead their hospital groups.  In others, new governance arrangements will be required at group level and in some they exist already.  The groups are now in place and the CEOs, chairs and management teams are appointed.  However, we will need to put this on a legislative basis by 2018.</p> <p> Service delivery reform also involves the restructuring of all health services outside the acute hospitals, that is, primary care, social care, mental care and health and well-being, into nine community health care organisations, CHOs, with the aim of providing the maximum proportion of care to people in the most appropriate settings in the communities where they live.  These CHOs have been established and their chief officers appointed and their development now needs to be driven forward.</p> <p> A crucial element in the reform programme must be investment in information and communications technology.  Partially as a result of past failures, but also because of competing demands, investment in ICT in Irish health care has fallen behind international standards and developments in the private sector, including general practice, pharmacy and private hospitals.  The recently announced capital plan will allow us to start catching up on ICT modernisation, including a new financial management system, facilitating the provision of important and timely information.  I look forward to a close collaboration with the private sector in the development and full utilisation of this technology in the period ahead.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900014#M00200"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill.  We have always been very supportive of the concept of lifetime community rating, solidarity and intergenerational support.  This is a key aspect of our philosophy in the context of how we develop society and support the various cohorts and age groups in society, but also in the context of private health insurance.  Lifetime community rating and intergenerational solidarity are critical components in this regard.  It is about encouraging people to take out private health insurance so there is a buoyant market where younger, healthier people contribute to the costs associated with supporting older and sicker people.  It is a very simple philosophy.</p>  <p>  On the one hand, the Minister speaks about health insurance, universal health care and the previous Government policy of universal health insurance.  On the other, we have the views previously expressed by the Minister and others, including the Taoiseach, with regard to community rating and risk equalisation, which were fundamentally opposed by Fine Gael for a long time.  As a result, I find it hard to understand what the Government envisages for the future, either in the context of the private health insurance market or the public health system.  The speech the Minister delivered today is the one he delivered at the Institute of Chartered Accountants recently but it does not leave me any clearer on what commitment the Government is making about the public health system and how it will be funded, supported and expanded in the years ahead to meet the critical demands that will be placed on it in terms of the demographic changes in our population, in particular the increase in population, as well as the advances in medical technologies and medical procedures.  While the Minister does talk about hospital groups and hospital trusts being more integrated within the regions, I am still unsure the Government actually knows what road it is taking in regard to the public health system.</p>  <p>  The Minister then throws in the issue of outside consultancy companies or others coming in to manage parts of our public hospital system, which means they will be able to deviate from, for example, the strict pay and conditions in the public health system and across the broader public service.  While I accept that should always be looked at in terms of whether it could bring advantage, it can certainly bring a lot of disadvantages if the Government is beginning to farm out certain areas of the public health system to private operators.  This would begin to lead down the road of privatisation and, in that context, we would be very concerned about the undermining of the public health system.</p>  <p>  To take the Bill itself, there is nothing in it we would not support in general and in principle.  As I said, it deals with the concept of risk equalisation and lifetime community rating.  Of course, lifetime community rating only comes about in a voluntary health insurance market and, until Tuesday morning last, we had assumed it would be a compulsory health insurance market in the context of universal health insurance.  Of course, the cat was out of the bag some time ago when the Government started to develop this concept we have been proposing for some time in regard to lifetime community rating.  In the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, I and many others said that once the Government had acknowledged lifetime community rating, it was effectively abandoning the core policy that had been proposed by the Government, which was compulsory universal health insurance.</p><p>There is no need to have an incentive to join the health insurance market if it is compulsory.  I would say that deep down, the Minister was trying to wiggle his way out of this particular universal health insurance model for some time.  He was probably looking for a timely time to do so.  I suppose the expectation was that the election would be over at this stage and he could have kept the cat in the bag until afterwards.  That has not transpired, however, and the Minister has been flushed out in doing what is a genuinely massive U-turn on a core principle of funding our public health system.<br/><br/>We are no wiser as to what type of system will follow on now.  In the meantime, however, we know for sure that our public health system is underfunded, underresourced and is meeting massive daily capacity challenges.  If one looks at our public health system, one can see that staff face a huge difficulty every day in trying to deliver care while patients try to access care.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the number of hospital beds available.  For years I was told by the previous Minister that there were sufficient beds and that it was not all about beds.  He also said that changes in admission or discharge policies and day-case procedures would all help to reduce the demand on beds.  I accept that but the bottom line is that there is a capacity issue in our public hospital system given the lack of beds.  There is also a capacity issue in the step-down area.  A critical issue, which is always forgotten in this debate, is that of intensive care unit beds.  We have to accept that ICU beds constitute the workhorse of any modern medical system yet, <i>pro rata</i>, international comparisons show that we are light years behind.  It creates huge difficulties in terms of theatre time and getting throughput for elective and emergency surgeries.  <br/><br/>All the planning that goes into assessing and diagnosing patients, as well as preparing them for treatment, including surgery, goes out the window when something happens due to the pinch-point of a complete lack of capacity in intensive care unit beds.  That is a key issue if we are to reduce the daily chaos of waiting lists and emergency department trolleys and yet it has almost been forgotten in the debate on our public health system.  We may pretend that things are improving but until that particular issue is addressed in a meaningful way in all major hospitals, we will have the continual problems of waiting lists and cancellations of elective surgeries.  That is because when there is any unexpected increase in demand, it all falls apart.  This happens in January each year, for example, and in other key periods of the year when there is a spike in demand for hospital services.<br/><br/>While the Minister is looking at grand plans, he might also look at the pragmatic and practical steps that need to be taken to ensure patients can access health care in a timely fashion.  The ratio of staff to ICU beds is extraordinarily high but it is also very necessary.  That fundamental area must to be examined.<br/><br/>As the Minister outlined, the Bill makes a number of changes to credits and levies in health insurance products.  It revises the rates recommended by the Health Insurance Authority and this will take effect from 1 March 2016.  The Bill also provides for an increase in risk equalisation credits for those aged over 65 years, based on age, gender and level of cover.  Meanwhile, credits for insured people aged 60 to 64 are set at zero.  The Bill also provides for a change to the proxy health status measure by expanding the circumstances where a utilisation credit is payable to include &euro;90 for each overnight stay in hospital and &euro;30 for day-case submissions.  In addition, there will be a reduction in stamp duty on products not providing advance cover for an adult from &euro;240 to &euro;202, which is a reduction of &euro;38, and from &euro;80 to &euro;67 for children, which is a reduction of &euro;13.  That is all very welcome.<br/><br/>We are trying to enhance and stimulate the health insurance market by encouraging people into it or, at least, not discouraging them from joining up.  In that context, however, we do not want to encourage people to join private health insurance by starving the public health system.  It is not a case of the public health system versus the private health insurance market because their work is complementary.  Those who avail of private health insurance reduce the capacity in the public health system.  We certainly do not want a situation where we are forcing families to take out private health insurance because they fear that without it, they cannot access services.<br/><br/>The obligation on any government or political party is to ensure that we have an adequately funded public health system.  If people wish to take out private health insurance, they should make that choice of their own volition instead of being afraid that if something happens, they will not be able to access diagnostics or treatment.  The latter concept must be changed.<br/><br/>The Minister cannot pat himself on the back for saying that there is an increase in the numbers taking out private health insurance.  There are many reasons people do so and there may be many circumstances for such an increase.  These reasons include the life-time community rating, which is an incentive for people to take out private health insurance.  In addition, the economy is picking up so people who had previously cancelled private health insurance are returning to the market.  <br/><br/>Another issue which must be addressed is that more than 400,000 people are waiting to see a consultant.  People are afraid that if anything happens to them or their families, they must have private health insurance.  The notion that starving the public health system and driving people into private health insurance is a reasonable decision by the Government is simply anathema to basic decency.  People should take out private health insurance by choice and not due to the waiting lists for inpatient or outpatient day-cases and the alarming consequential causes, including delayed diagnostics and treatment.<br/><br/>While we await new proposals from the Minister on how he intends to fund the public health system in the years ahead, in the short to medium term he has a few fundamental issues to address.  All the grand changes he is proposing across the board may or may not come to anything.  Regardless of what policies he sets in train for the coming years, they will be ineffective if he, or his successor, does not address the fundamental issue of resources in key areas of our public health system and we will be continually debating people waiting on trolleys for inordinate lengths of time, as well as those who are unable to access diagnostics, treatment or therapies.  The Minister has acknowledged that is happening every day of the week and he even pointed out that things could get worse before they improve.  We cannot just wait for reform.  We must have some commitment to resources and fund the key areas of difficulty.<br/><br/>The Minister has said it is not always about throwing money at problems, and he is correct.  The fair deal scheme is one example of where it was obvious that there would be major problems.  Some people simply could not access beds while others were waiting up to 20 weeks to get a nursing home bed.  That was directly down to a lack of resources.  The Minister placed a cap on that beyond which people could not access private nursing home services.  Resources are required to fill the vacuum in key areas where there is an obvious demand.  The Minister starved the fair deal scheme of funding needed for many people across the country.<br/><br/>The Minister has made great play about the number of consultants who have been recruited and there is movement in that regard.  It is slow in many cases, however, and it seems almost impossible for the HSE to attract people with certain skill sets into this country.</p><p> This is an issue that must be addressed.  I said this years ago when the former Minister was on a populist campaign talking about cutting salaries here and there.  Everybody had to share pain but the idea that we would drive people we need abroad does not stack up.  I am not advocating for consultants who are well able to advocate for themselves but we must retain a special cohort of expertise in our health services.  The Government has failed to do that and now faces the consequent difficulties.  </p> <p> The Government took the same approach to nurses with its graduate grade.  Nurses who qualified and went to work in the health service worked for sums that were far less than those who had only qualified a few years previously, for no logical reason other than what seemed to be a populist view that the Government was challenging the public health system and taking it on.  What the Government was doing was dismantling the cornerstone of the delivery of health care.  We need doctors and nurses in our health system and by discouraging them or encouraging or forcing them to go abroad, the Government undermined the ability to deliver services.  </p> <p> Speech and language therapy is another key area involving our best and brightest.  There are inordinate delays in accessing speech and language therapy.  Parents are simply at the end of their tether trying to access assessment, diagnosis and therapy.  They are waiting inordinate lengths of time.  The Minister will say, and it has been said in replies here and elsewhere, that priority is always given to people but a parent whose child may have speech and language challenges wants an assessment first and then wants to be able to access therapy.  However, as things stand they cannot do so.  For a three, four or five-year-old child, a waiting list of a year is a long time in their formative years when they need access to therapy.  In key areas where professionals are required to deliver health care, the Government has been very slow in trying to ensure we do not have a haemorrhage of people - a drain of the best and brightest.  </p> <p> At the same time, one could argue that the Government has been  handy in recruiting at management level within the HSE.  We would like to see a re-balancing of that so the issue of front-line staff - those who are delivering health care in our emergency departments and wards and throughout the broader health system - must be addressed quickly.  I know the Minister is saying that the Government is recruiting extra nurses and this is welcome but if you look at what is required in terms of manpower, the manpower surveys, or the workforce requirements as they are now called, that are taking place will show that there is a dearth of certain specialties within our health system which is causing huge difficulties.  </p> <p> The Minister will say that this will all cost money and it does, which is why we must prioritise.  Very often one will hear Opposition parties, organisations and advocacy groups simply campaign for additional resources.  That comes with a cost, which is why we need to have a genuine debate among ourselves about the political campaign that will be held over the coming months.  How much are we willing to pay for health services?  What type of health service do we want?  Every day of the week, we are being told that Fine Gael will consistently cut taxes, including taxes for the highest earners.  The Minister will then come along and tell me that we intend to do so much in the years ahead.  I find it difficult to square that circle because a simple mathematics exercise would highlight the fact that this is not a credible position to hold.  If we are to be committed to a public health system, we must commit ourselves to funding it and funding it in a way that allows people to have confidence in it as opposed to what is happening at the moment, namely, forcing people to take out private health insurance out of fear and concern for themselves and their families.  Private health insurance should be based on complementary services as opposed to not being able to get services in the public health system.  </p> <p> The Minister spoke about the various other areas of the health service that need to be addressed to arrive at a situation where we do not have continuous chronic overcrowding in our emergency departments and where people present in hospitals unnecessarily.  He referred to primary and community care and the GP being central to that.  He also spoke about public health nurses, community care workers and other specialists who work and provide care in the community.  Everybody has bought into the primary care strategy and the philosophy behind it, which involves caring for people in the community and in the primary care setting.  The Minister spoke about the need to encourage GPs to specialise in the areas of chronic disease and minor procedures.  This is outlined in the primary care strategy.  Of course, it needs resourcing, support for GPs and additional training for them and for other health care professionals working in the community.  It requires extra resources in terms of personnel.  </p> <p> We have a situation where public health nurses, who are very valued contributors to the delivery of care across the country, are no longer able to carry out their functions because there are not enough of them.  If we are to be honest with ourselves in terms of GP care, the primary care setting and caring for people in the community and the home, we must admit that the key link, of having public health nurses available to ensure there is a link between the GP and the primary care and home care settings, has been completely starved of any resources.  It is being severely undermined at a time when it is greatly valued by those who benefit from it.  Traditionally, public health nurses would support people who do not have medical cards but we now find that they are under so much pressure they cannot see people for a number of days.  Services like changing dressings and administering medication are simply not deliverable in the way they should be.  If we are talking about grand plans, how they function on the ground is critically important.  We need a key analysis of our public health nurses, the role they play in the community and that link between discharge from hospital to the home or community care setting and preventing people from having to visit hospital in the first place because of the inability of the primary care setting to support a person in the home.  </p> <p> GPs are under huge pressure.  We now see delays or GPs being unable to see people on a same-day basis.  Traditionally, that was part and parcel of the health system.  Most health care is provided by GP services throughout the country.  There was always the comfort that a person could access his or her GP in a timely fashion.  We now see delays in terms of being able to see a GP on a same-day basis.  This is an indication of pressure points.  If the Minister wishes to bring in the concept of chronic disease management and minor procedures in the primary care setting at GP level, which is the right thing to do, he must accept that capacity must be enhanced and increased.  This requires support for GPs and nurse specialists coming into the community.  </p> <p> When one looks at the demographic pressures we are facing and the profile of our population, and this goes back to health insurance, one can see that we will have two huge challenges in the years ahead.  There will be a pensions issue, which we have acknowledged is a concern and will be a huge challenge for the State in terms of how it is to be funded.</p><p>The National Pension Reserve Fund was established and has been raided a few times to fund essential short-term measures.  We have to start accepting that we must replenish the fund quite quickly in order that we will not end up funding pensions from current expenditure on a continuing basis. </p> <p> We are not doing anything near what is required to enhance capacity in the way of bricks and mortar, personnel and supports in the community for elderly people.  The Minister seems to have a very weak commitment to increasing home help hours to prevent people from going into hospital, step-down, community or long-term care facilities.  Elderly people have to wait a long time to access home help support.  A person deemed to be in need of home help is told to wait some time before accessing it.  An 85 year old cannot afford to wait some time for such help.  A person deemed to require home help should receive it immediately.  Otherwise he or she cannot stay at home or will need other supports that may not be available and can very quickly end up in a long-term care or an acute hospital setting.  Priority must be given to trying to maintain as many people as possible in their homes and the community care setting, but I do not see this happening in the short term.  </p> <p> The Minister has committed in the capital expenditure programme to enhance community care settings around the country, but that has been delayed for several years because of the Health Information and Quality Authority's requirements for the licensing of public nursing homes and inspections and qualifications.  We need to accept that we will need more capacity as time passes to ensure that will happen.</p> <p> We need more community geriatricians and nurse specialists to visit nursing homes and save bringing a patient from a nursing home to a hospital.  The number of geriatricians is very small and people working in this area say it is very difficult to get a specialist out to make a diagnosis.  General practitioners are very often brought out and may come from the co-operative such as South Doc or West Doc.  They may not have the necessary expertise or confidence to make a call because they may be locums and not know the patients involved.  Very often an ambulance is called and the patient is taken to hospital.  The Minister should consider bulking up the geriatric expertise available in the community setting in discussions he holds about primary, community or home care services. </p> <p> The Minister referred to technology.  Ireland is at the cutting edge of software development and design.  There is a huge opportunity for the country to be at the cutting edge in using technology to care for and monitor people at home.  We have to start being very creative and imaginative in that regard.  People still fax information.  There should be real-time information sent by public health nurses who visit patients back to the GP who could feed it to hospitals.  With the creation of the individual health identifier, this concept needs to be embraced very quickly to enable the health system to assess and plan a patient care pathway and identify the resources required if a patient is to be discharged from hospital to home or the community care setting.  A real-time response and flexibility within the workforce to deal with these demands should be considered.  We can be creative and imaginative in that regard.  It is being done in other countries.  Technology could help to break down the silos in which the health system sometimes works.</p> <p> We welcome the Bill but not the complete confusion in government about how to fund the public health system in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Other amendments in the Bill apply to the principal Act, the Health Insurance Act 1994, and include definition changes, while others apply to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  In the context of where health services are, Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the passage of the Bill. </p>  <p>  There is an irony in the timing of Second Stage of this legislation in that it coincides with the Minister for Health&rsquo;s memo to the Cabinet this week on the unaffordability &ldquo;now or never&rdquo; of the multi-payer model of universal health insurance, UHI, his party&rsquo;s and the Government&rsquo;s central plank of their health policy.  Proposed by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy James Reilly, the Fine Gael UHI plan was front and centre of that party&rsquo;s manifesto in the run-up to the last general election in 2011.  It was subsequently adopted as Government policy in the programme for Government adopted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  From the outset I described it as unworkable and unaffordable in placing our health and very lives in the hands of for-profit insurance companies.  While mine was not the only voice, we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, have been consistent opponents of this proposition for almost the past almost five years of the Government and previously.  </p>  <p>  The blind adherence of the former Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and the Taoiseach to the proposed funding model raises serious questions about their competence and suitability to hold high public office.  It was not just me as an Opposition spokesperson on health who spelled out the dangers of the course the then Minister, the Taoiseach and their Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues in government were planning to take.  Their lauding of the multi-payer system in operation in the Netherlands attracted expressions of caution from within that country, including from less expected sources.  The director general of Nefarma, the Dutch pharmaceutical industry lobby group, Michael Dutr&eacute;e, in addressing the 2011 annual conference of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association stated health care in the Netherlands under the multi-payer system was based on cost, not need.</p><p>The Dutch introduced their model of private-public health care, with private insurance companies competing to access public health services in 2006.  By 2011 the cost of an ever reducing basket of services had increased by almost 10%, with the cost of unincluded, uncovered services increasing by 50%.</p></speech>

For example, on an average mortgage of &euro;200,000, they are paying &euro;4,000 more than somebody living in France or Germany.  We have called repeatedly on the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to get the banks to reduce these rates but, unfortunately, to no avail.  Other than AIB which dropped its rates by 0.75%, no other bank has reduced its standard variable rate mortgage.  The banks' response has been as inadequate as that of the Government.  The mantra from the Minister is that competition will fix it.  He has encouraged people to switch banks, but competition alone will not solve this ongoing crisis.  Only 712 mortgage customers switched banks in 2015, allegedly from a pool of 100,000.  That in itself represents the weak, competitive nature of the mortgage market in Ireland and also illustrates that the Government is suggesting a solution that it knows is not working.  Even the Central Bank accepts that there is a problem, while the Minister has washed his hands of the matter.  That is unfair and unjust on families who are paying &euro;4,000 more per year than their European counterparts.  He said he wanted to wait and see if competition between the banks would decrease the rates offered.  Obviously, that wait and see approach is not working and I contend it will not work.  It is even harder to stomach when people read that the Exchequer is enjoying unprecedented profitability, with various windfalls, while families are struggling to pay this extra &euro;4,000 on top of what should be their normal mortgage repayments.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe it is fair that banks are charging Irish customers a rate that is up to 2% higher, or &euro;4,000 more per year, on their variable standard rate mortgages?  Does she agree with the Central Bank that this is a major problem?  Can she honestly say she agrees with the wait and see approach to the issue adopted by Government for close on 12 months?</p></speech>

Last year the average increase in rent was 9.3% - it was 9.7% outside Dublin.  Rents have returned almost to the level they were at the peak of the housing bubble.  Individuals and families throughout the country are already struggling to keep a roof over their heads and yet the Government is unwilling to intervene in the market unless, of course, it is to give tax breaks and incentives to developers.  There are no breaks for ordinary families.</p>  <p>  The Government promised rent certainty and rent control.  All the Minister, Deputy Kelly, could deliver was a two-year rent freeze, which in reality is just a delayed rent review.  It has also resulted in an immediate increase in rent for some.  The Government promised investment in social housing.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, boasted of a tenfold increase in social housing build, but let us be clear that is a tenfold increase from 20 houses.</p>  <p>  This is a case of far too little and much too late.  The reality is that the Labour Party has sided with Fine Gael against struggling families.  For families who had hoped to own a home, that hope is fading.  Labour promised not to introduce, ironically, water charges, but it did that.  Today we hear that the Government intends stopping local authority tenants from having the right to buy their homes if they have not paid the water charge.  That is some record.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party's approach to housing is like its approach to water charges.  It folds and adopts Fine Gael policy.  It has failed tenants, it has failed families and its policies have created incredible hardship.  Is it not now time to go back to the drawing board and deliver what it promised, which was rent control, rent certainty and security for tenants?  Is it not time to revisit the things it promised to block, specifically water charges?</p></speech>

The heart of the Government's housing proposal is to build more units through a variety of mechanisms.  This is under way as we speak in every part of the country.  Is it under way as quickly as I would like?  Frankly, no.  It has taken us a long time to, for instance, regenerate the housing departments in various local authorities that had gone out of business largely because the previous Government relied entirely on rented housing.</p></speech>

This morning there are three factory super trawlers fishing off the Donegal coast.  One vessel has a Lithuanian flag, another vessel has a Dutch flag and the third vessel has a German flag.  All of the vessels are more than likely owned by a single Dutch company.  They have been happily fishing away while small inshore Irish fishing vessels cannot get quota and are not allowed to fish at all.  They are forced to stay at home in ports all around Donegal.  Everyone in the Irish fishing community knows that the EU stole our fishing stocks when we joined the EU in 1973.</p></speech>

Today, more than 1.1 million tonnes of fish are caught in Irish waters every year and less than 20% of that is caught by Irish fishermen.  The Government's only response to the situation is to encourage foreign vessels to land their catch in Irish ports, hoping they can be processed here, rather than trying to undo the wrong that has been done to our fishing communities over many years.</p></speech>

Some of this company's vessels have been exposed for fishing illegally in recent years, catching fish to order and falsifying logbooks in order to under-declare their catches.  Since January this year there has been a ban on discards for the pelagic fishery, meaning that those vessels can no longer dump fish at sea for which they do not have quota.  The Lithuanian factory trawler, <i>MFV Margiris</i>, only has a quota for horse mackerel in Irish waters, yet from talking to fishermen I know that it is practically impossible at this time of year to catch only horse mackerel when fishing off the west coast.  One catches mackerel as well at the same time.  Either they are dumping the mackerel at sea, which is illegal, or they are processing them on board and keeping them, which is also illegal.</p><p>If that was not bad enough, as I speak, a County Donegal fisherman is watching from his home as these vessels tow away his crab pots and take away his livelihood from him and his family.  Will the T&aacute;naiste immediately order the Naval Service to intervene to save this fisherman's livelihood and allow him to be able to maintain an income for his family?  I have been in contact with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and because of the weather conditions off the west coast, it has stated it is unsafe to board these vessels to inspect them at sea.  Will the T&aacute;naiste order these vessels to a safe harbour now in order that they can be inspected by Irish authorities?</p></speech>

In keeping with standard practice for all vessels, it is being monitored continuously by the Naval Service.  The vessel is operating within the Irish exclusive economic zone.  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, any EU vessel can fish in any region's EU waters where it has a quota.  This vessel has a quota entitling it to fish for species such as scad horse mackerel within EU waters and it is authorised to conduct fishing activity in this area.  As with all vessels, it must record its catches and assess them against quotas in compliance with EU sea-fisheries legislation.  The <i>Margiris</i>, and all vessels operating in Irish waters, are monitored continuously by the Naval Service through the fisheries monitoring centre at the naval base in Haulbowline using satellite vessel monitoring, the automatic identification system and the electronic reporting systems.  The authority is committed to ensuring that EU quotas are fairly and sustainably managed continuously.  This year, with the support of the Naval Service, there has been a prioritisation to implement the new landing obligation by all vessels operating within the Irish zone.</p></speech>

It would be a simple matter for the Government to tell the Naval Service to intervene with that vessel and to stop it from destroying the livelihoods of Irish fishermen.

The response simply is not good enough and this issue must be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  In addition, the online pressure group, Uplift, has created a petition with more than 30,000 signatories condemning the actions of such supertrawlers off the Irish coast.  All along the coast, fishermen are sickened because they must sit at home and watch these vessels continue to fish in front of their homes while the Government is standing idly by and is allowing this to happen.  Last summer, a Danish vessel in the Irish Sea had penalty points imposed on it by that highly effective agency, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  However, the Danish Government refused to add those penalty points to the vessel's licence.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, moneys for education services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on are necessary and welcome.  We should not, however, in this of all years, proceed in the absence of a debate in this Chamber because this is the last year of the Supplementary Estimates process.  Year-on-year budgets are introduced and Supplementary Estimates are later provided to plug identified gaps.  What the Government proposes to do in the budgetary cycle when the Supplementary Estimates process is no longer available to it is a serious matter that requires debate and it would be remiss of us as parliamentarians to let it pass.</p>  <p>  On the Planning and Development (Urgent Social Housing Supply) Policy Directive 2015, I can only assume that it refers to the modular housing proposal.  Again, it is a new departure in social housing provision.  We are told that it is an emergency measure, around which many of us have got our heads on the basis that providing modular housing versus bed and breakfast and hotel room accommodation is the lesser of two evils, but it is far from the ideal solution.  The concern is that this will become the face of social housing provision in the State.  Again, this matter is worthy of consideration and debate in this Chamber.</p></speech>

The additional funding which, as the Deputy correctly said, amounts to over &euro;1.6 billion in gross voted expenditure in 2015 has allowed the Government to target additional expenditure at areas experiencing increased demand and demographic pressures, particularly the education system, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other important sectors.  The Supplementary Estimates do not include the proposed health or social protection spend because at this stage we do not know what the final PRSI receipts for the year will be.  In the case of my own Department, we are not a position to accurately predict what the Supplementary Estimate will be, but we do know, for instance, that, as has always been the case, the Christmas bonus will be paid from it.  There is also a timing issue in the making of pension payments on New Year's Eve rather than the following day.  I can tell the Deputy what the likely spend will be, but until such time as the PRSI receipts and more information on the November returns have been received, we will not know what the definitive outturn will be.  Approval is being sought today for 13 Votes, with an aggregate value of &euro;472 million, &euro;175 million of which is being allocated to the Department of Education and Skills, from which &euro;50 million will be provided for the summer works programme for schools.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being allocated an additional &euro;35 million, which I am sure will be welcomed on all sides of the House.  An additional &euro;100 million is being provided for public transport, which I would have thought would be welcomed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is receiving an additional &euro;50 million to provide for further expenditure on regional job creation measures, which, again, I am sure will be welcomed on all sides of the House.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is receiving an additional allocation of &euro;65 million.  </p>  <p>  The Supplementary Estimates were announced in the context of the 2016 budget.  If Sinn F&eacute;in wants to have a debate on the matter, I do not have any problem with it, but I suggest the Deputy take up the matter of the arrangement of that debate with the Whips of all parties.  We should proceed with thee Supplementary Estimates because they provide for the allocation of additional resources for garda&iacute;, schools and the public transport system.</p></speech>

Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that as a result of this many local authorities may be forced to withdraw from the process of agreeing to a budget?  The Government has directed all local authorities to agree to a budget, regardless of whether this requires them to increase property taxes or commercial rates, despite the fact that there was a commitment from the Government to overhaul the commercial rates system.

The presentation by the IFA was very impressive, particularly the focus on finding ways of identifying and labelling machinery.  As was stated at the committee meeting, we must remember that as well as the people doing the robbing and causing stress directly, there are other people helping to sell on the stolen goods and livestock.

When the operation was eventually closed, the quality of life in the locality improved.  In recent months, however, to the shock of the local community, the council, without any consultation, entered into an agreement with a foreign company which could see the construction of a monster gasification plant in the heart of this rural community.  We have had debates in this House on incineration and fracking and there is legislation on some of those areas.  Is any legislation proposed to deal with gasification?  There is no national policy to protect communities, like that in Gortadroma, from the environmental effects of gasification.  I am calling for a debate on this matter and clarification as to whether any legislation will be brought forward to protect communities.</p></speech>

Will she give a more specific date as to when it will be introduced in the House?  Her colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, has had a Bill providing for such a reduction for some time.  I know that she is an advocate of reducing the bankruptcy term.  Many are waiting for it to happen such as entrepreneurs who want to get back into business.  As an avalanche of house repossessions is coming down the tracks, such legislation would give those affected some hope, too.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion and many public meetings in communities on the problem of burglaries.  We have received a response from the Government which is far from adequate.  While some of the measures announced are welcome, some do not go far enough.</p><p>This legislation proposes the National Roads Authority provide proper CCTV coverage of junctions in the major road networks.  Recently, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was mandated and resourced to purchase high powered vehicles to patrol and police motorways.  We know from Garda intelligence that the motorways are being used by roving criminal gangs to travel from Dublin city to remote and isolated rural parts of the country to engage in crime, theft and burglary.  The provision of CCTV cameras at motorway junctions would be a major asset in curbing and detecting crime.  We know that the motorways are so well patrolled, they could be picked up in time.</p><p>In addition to the provision of CCTV cameras, there are other measures which we have previously introduced in this House.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be brought back up to 14,000.  It is currently languishing below 12,500.  Quite simply, the Government has kept the moratorium on recruitment in place for far too long.</p></speech>

There is no reason its complement could not be increased threefold.  The Government&rsquo;s measures to protect the elderly do not go far enough.  It has not introduced any robust legislation to provide suitable custodial terms for vicious assaults perpetrated against the elderly members of the community.  Burglaries continue to increase under its watch.  Thankfully, we now have an independent barometer of crime rates through the Central Statistics Office.  However, it is showing that headline crime trends are, unfortunately, moving in the wrong direction, but the Government has failed to do anything about this.  We are also calling for a national directorate to help voluntary organisations involved in crime prevention such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert.</p>  <p>  It is with this in mind that we have launched this Bill to provide for CCTV coverage at motorway junctions.  It would be within the remit of the National Roads Authority to install CCTV systems, maintain them and link them with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be a valuable tool in the prevention and detection of crime.</p></speech>

By 2011 the cost of an ever reducing basket of services had increased by almost 10%, with the cost of unincluded and uncovered services increasing by 50%.</p><p>Mr. Dutr&eacute;e raised the prospect of health care costs in the Netherlands doubling over the subsequent ten or more years, painting a picture of the Dutch people paying at least 25% of their annual income on health care, making the Netherlands the dearest country in the world for access to basic care, even more expensive than the United States of America.  Was anyone in Fine Gael or the Labour Party listening?  Was the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly or the Taoiseach taking any of this on board?  </p> <p> There were countless other voices.  Indeed, there was a parade of caution but regrettably, it was clearly a case of "carry on regardless" and what a carry on it has been.  Con men and their fellow traveller con artists have fed the Irish public a fallacy over the past five years.  The current Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar has been hedging his bets on universal health insurance since taking over the health portfolio from his Cabinet colleague, Deputy Reilly, but it took the blunt honesty of the ESRI and Dr. Maev-Ann Wren's determination to call it as she saw it, to wrest an acceptance from the Minister that the truth must out.  Now we know that the Government's health plan is not viable, never was and never will be.  </p> <p> The Minister, attempting a soft landing for his embarrassed Fine Gael and Labour Party fellow Ministers, has said that he has requested further research on universal health insurance.  What of An Taoiseach?  Yesterday, in the course of Leader's Questions, the Taoiseach exposed his continuing personal comfort with the universal health insurance multi-player proposition when referring to the ESRI analysis.  He reluctantly confirmed, after advising he could argue certain points, that the Government would not proceed with "that model" of universal health insurance.  That he is wedded to a form of health insurance as the paying mechanism for health care is beyond question.  The Minister for Health, despite his preference for referring to universal health care as distinct from universal health insurance, is as committed to a universal health insurance model as his Taoiseach and political master.  </p> <p> What Ireland and its people need is a system of health care services delivery paid for by fair and progressive taxation, accessible on the basis of medical need - and need alone - which is free at the point of delivery.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to such a system.  We are committed to ending the discriminatory and immoral - I emphasise immoral - two-tier system that fast-tracks those who can pay, leaving the less well off to languish on waiting lists, many in pain and all suffering anguish as they wait and wait.  A day will yet come when the shared view of the two-tier system of health care services and the piggy-backing of private practice and private access on our publicly funded health services will be one of shame.  All political parties, civic society organisations and churches of all denominations should be vocal in their condemnation of what is happening in our health services today.  They should all be committed to achieving a single-tier public health system of which we can all be proud.  No-one who claims to believe in equality or who claims to be a republican can take any other position.  </p> <p> While I have indicated that my party will support the passage of this Bill, I again urge the Minister to park any further review of universal health insurance and to stick firmly to universal health care and how we can develop that through a fair and progressive taxation system.  That is something that all elected opinion should be able to rally behind and collectively ensure the delivery of within the earliest timeframe possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900025#X00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015.  The Bill raises the question of equity of access to health services in this country.  We currently have a two-tier health system where ability to pay is key to timely access to services but what we need is a system based on medical need and which is free at the point of delivery.  That concept is becoming more widely accepted and should be at the core of the delivery of our health services.  Professor Brian Nolan of the ESRI said recently that the two-tier system is now widely regarded as problematic from an equity perspective.  In the same vein, Ms Suzanne Quin, senior lecturer in social policy at UCD said that a policy which enables those who can afford it to access alternative paths to what they see as being a more comprehensive, superior quality and faster service is hard to justify on grounds of social justice while Dr. Samantha Smith of the ESRI said that health services should be delivered according to need.</p>  <p>  This is an enormous issue for our health service.  We need a service based on medical need which is free at the point of delivery.  Related to that is the provision of health services as close to the patient as possible, the funding of those services and their quality.  The provision of health services as close to patients as possible should be a key priority.  All services should be provided locally to service users where possible.  I accept that specialist services always have been and will continue to be necessary and that patients will have to travel to regional centres and specialist hospitals to avail of them.  However, 95% of services can and should be provided locally in local general hospitals such as South Tipperary General Hospital.  </p>  <p>  I wish to refer in particular to the provision of inpatient acute psychiatric services in County Tipperary.  The decision to close the service was taken by the previous Government through the former Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, while the implementation of that decision was carried out by the current Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  That decision and subsequent closure was made against the advice of advocates, general practitioners, consultants and the entire mental health community in County Tipperary.</p><p>We now have a situation where there is no inpatient acute mental health service in the whole of County Tipperary.  People in the south of the county must go to Kilkenny for services and those in the north of the county must go to Ennis.</p> <p> The inpatient service in Kilkenny is the one I know best and it is particularly dysfunctional.  South Tipperary patients are being absolutely disadvantaged in having to travel to Kilkenny for the service.  The service should be and could be delivered locally.  I have regular contact with families who tell me it is very difficulty to get admitted to the inpatient services in Kilkenny.  When a person is admitted, there are questions around early discharge and follow-ups are not carried out by the same consultant.  This is unacceptable.  A strong case can be made for inpatient services to be provided in Tipperary.  Will the Minister examine the situation again and put in place, as requested, a small inpatient unit for the county?  Eight or ten beds would be adequate. </p> <p> The community-based teams are not staffed properly.  They are deficient, in particular, in respect of paramedical staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers.  Despite the best efforts of the staff, who provide a good service, they are hampered by the lack of fully-staffed community-based teams.  </p> <p> Will the Minister provide additional funding and staff for the general hospital service?  In particular, I speak about South Tipperary General Hospital.  The hospital has lost about 20% of its budget, which is about &euro;12.5 million, and approximately 100 staff members.  As a result, members of staff are working under huge pressure on a 24 hour basis.  They have done tremendous work, given the hospital is running at a capacity of approximately 120%, but the situation simply cannot continue.  Staffing levels need to be urgently addressed and, in particular, additional nursing and support staff need to be put in place.  </p> <p> The lack of funding and resources creates a particular problem in the accident and emergency unit.  People are on trolleys for long hours and often for longer than 24 hours.  The service urgently needs to be sorted out.  We were promised an additional ten step-down beds.  These beds are urgently needed to address the difficulties in the accident and emergency unit.  We also need to open additional beds in the hospital to cater for the overflow from, and difficulties in, the accident and emergency unit. </p> <p> The hospital needs capital development.  A phase two development for the hospital is on the books.  I urge the Minister to provide the capital investment required for the phase two development of the old part of the hospital.  The new endoscopy, surgery and theatre services provided a number of years ago were an excellent development and are working very well but the older part of the hospital requires urgent attention and capital funding.  Will the Minister make moneys available for the phase two development of South Tipperary General Hospital?</p></speech>

However, the pain I get in my head is minor compared to the pain and hardship felt by people who have to wait for hours, if not days, on trolleys.  It is minor compared to that suffered by people who are waiting in chronic pain for more than two to two and a half years for operations.</p>  <p>  I mentioned a lady in my constituency who is looking for a hip replacement to the Minister a while ago.  This lady rings me regularly.  She is in absolute dire and chronic pain.  She cannot move.  This woman worked very hard all her life.  She is told there is an 18 month waiting list but, as she points out, it took her approximately six to eight months to get on the list.  The 18 months clock only started ticking then.  She asks me what she is supposed to do for the next 18 months given she cannot move.  This is the suffering that is going on.  We then have the shambles in child mental health services and the chronic under-resourcing of residential care for people with disabilities.  The list of chronically under-resourced health services goes on and the people who the health service is supposed to serve continue to suffer terrible hardship.</p>  <p>  Is there a connection between the pain I get in my head when I think about risk equalisation, risk equalisation credits and lifetime community rating systems and the labyrinthine systems surrounding the competitive private health insurance industry?  I put it to the Minister that there is and it has now been exposed by what one might argue is an unlikely source.  It is certainly not a radically left source.  The source is the ESRI and its report on the universal health insurance model, a model the Government claimed it was going to deliver and claims it had been working on since it was elected.</p>  <p>  The ESRI has blown out of the water all of the main contentions this Government put forward about the merits of universal health insurance.  It has confirmed all the key criticisms of those of us who opposed that vision and model and said it would not work.  By extension, it has confirmed the private health insurance industry is simply not the way to deliver the sort of health services people who are sick and in pain need.</p><p> Trying to trawl through the complexities of this stuff is a pointless and futile exercise.  All of it is unnecessary; it is waste.  We are developing a complicated system to guarantee the private profits of a parasitical, profit seeking, health insurance industry that does nothing to deliver the health services people need.  It is purely parasitical.  The ESRI confirms this when it indicates that the &euro;300 million margin that is taken by the private health insurance companies is one of the major reasons, if not the major reason, that the universal health insurance model the Minister had championed is simply not workable, will be too expensive and will not deliver for the patients.  That is due to their profit taking.  This confirms what we have been saying to the Minister and his predecessor for four years.  When the Minister's predecessor made grand announcements about how the universal health insurance model would begin to be rolled out from January this year and would be completed by 2019, that it would provide a better, more efficient and cheaper service, reduce the cost of health care and so forth, we said the opposite would be the case.  All the international evidence, and this is confirmed by the ESRI, showed that it would be the opposite and that it would make health care more costly and would not deliver the goods in terms of services.</p> <p> If we are honest and apply ideological commitments to competitive insurance markets and competition in the health area, is it not blindingly obvious that the private health insurance industry must take &euro;300 million in profits, it must have a big administration for sending out bills, it must pay big executive salaries to the top people in the private health insurance companies and it must advertise?  One cannot move without encountering private health insurance advertising.  It is everywhere.  It is on advertising hoardings, radio stations and television.  That costs big money.  The people who take out private health insurance are paying for it.  Ordinary citizens are paying for these advertisements, the executive salaries, the profits and for the huge billing, none of which contributes anything to front-line services for the people who are waiting for two years for an operation or for days on a trolley.  Is it not obvious that this is simply waste?</p> <p> That is the reason we find it difficult to get our heads around a Bill such as this.  The legislation is trying to manage an irrational and parasitical system.  Risk equalisation is about keeping the private health insurers in business so they can make money.  It is about luring them in.  The Minister and I debated this issue on a television programme and I was one of the few people who were very critical of the Minister.  I am not throwing language around loosely but I believed the measures introduced by the Minister meant the Minister was effectively acting as a tout for these private, for-profit health insurance companies.  He was saying to people that if they were over a certain age they would be penalised unless they had already taken out private health insurance.  That was scaring people into taking out private health insurance, a huge amount of which then goes into waste on advertising, billing and executive salaries.  I forgot to mention the private consultants.  A sum of &euro;400 million per year goes from the private health insurance companies into the pockets of private consultants.  That is waste.  To top up their already substantial public salaries they receive an extra &euro;400 million from the premiums paid by people for private health insurance.</p> <p> What does one get for one's private health insurance?  I have never taken out private health insurance, and I never will, because apart from not believing in a two-tier system in which one pays to jump queues, it is clear one does not get anything for it.  The big news that must be conveyed to the people who are terrified into taking out private health insurance is that one gets nothing for it.  If one has a heart attack one ends up on a trolley in the same way as everybody else.  That is the truth.  One might move a little faster in the queues for some operations, but not for others.  I have much anecdotal evidence that people sometimes get things faster in the public system in some areas, even though they will still have to wait for months, than they would in the private system.</p> <p> Has the Minister or the Government even quantified any of this?  I have mentioned the amount of money that goes to private consultants from the private health insurance system.  Do we know how much it spends on advertising?  Would it not be useful to find out how much is wasted on advertising and billing administration?  I asked about this with regard to the public health system last October.  I tabled a parliamentary question seeking the annual cost of collecting fees in public hospitals for the last four years, including administration costs, the cost of debt collection agencies and legal costs.  The Minister did not know the answer so he passed the question to the HSE.  The HSE has passed it on to the hospital groups because it does not know either.  How are we to have an efficient health system when the Minister does not know how much this stuff costs?  How are we to accord him any credibility?  Fine Gael is supposed to be the party of efficiency, yet the Minister does not even know how much this stuff is costing us.  It is an absolute waste.  Money is going on this stuff and even on the parliamentary questions that go back and forth in an effort to gather information about it.  We would not have to ask them if the money was not going on this but into front-line health services.</p> <p> International evidence shows that what I and other Members on this side of the House have been saying for the last four years is right.  The cost of health insurance in Holland went through the roof under the model the Minister was pursuing.  In the United States, billing costs account for over 30% of overall health expenditure.  Please do not tell me that is efficient.  That is the inevitable result of believing in competitive markets and competitive private health insurance being an integral part of a health system.  It is simply parasitical.  We can argue the toss on the efficacy of markets.  There is not much strong evidence.  The only evidence I am ever quoted about the efficacy of markets is Ryanair, God help us.  Whatever about the airline industry, and it is debatable in that case to put it mildly, it just does not work in health care.</p> <p> The other argument I hear, and I listened to a debate on the radio about this, is that if we had our way all the doctors would leave the country because we want to cut their wages to &euro;100,000.  There has already been emigration of some of our consultants, nurses and so forth.  It was pointed out to me today that the consultants in the NHS are only paid &euro;70,000.  The Minister can shake his head, but that is what I was told.  Perhaps he will give me the figures.</p></speech>

I still contend, even if, as the Minister is suggesting, they are going on strike for better pay, what they are looking for would still leave them earning considerably less than what consultants are getting here.  If we add in what the consultants are getting in private practice, given they are paid by the public purse and, then, as I mentioned, get &euro;400 million from the private health insurance companies, they are earning pretty good money over here.</p>  <p>  The reason they are leaving is because the health service in a mess.  When the bag I carry my computer in burst, and I had to get another bag for the computer, coincidentally, I found an article written by Senator John Crown three or four years ago in which he made exactly this point.  He said the reason doctors are leaving is not primarily to do with pay; it is to do with the mess in the health service.  The international evidence shows this.  Now, the ESRI is confirming that the Minister's model is basically null and void.</p>  <p>  What is the alternative?  The alternative is the national health service model.  It is a one-tier system, with health care based on medical need, free at the point of delivery.  Why would that be more efficient and cheaper?  It is because there would not be all the waste, with excessive money going to private consultants through private health insurance companies, and all of the advertising, the billing and the unnecessary administration.  The money could just be focused on the health service.</p>  <p>  Would it still cost us, given this is the other thing the Minister will say?  It would cost us.  The ESRI suggests that in order to deliver the Minister's model, we would need between &euro;500 million and &euro;2 billion extra.  I would say we still need that and probably a bit more - probably &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion - and we would certainly need to reverse the cuts that have been imposed in recent years, when the Government cut the budget from &euro;17 billion to &euro;13 billion and axed 10,000 staff and thousands of beds.  That would need to be reversed and we would need more investment in a number of areas.  One way or another, we need more money in the health service.  However, if we did not have all of this profit-taking by private health insurance companies, the unnecessary and excessive money going to private consultants, and all the administration, billing, advertising and so on, that money could be directed to front-line services where it would be more efficiently spent.  In addition, I, the Minister and ordinary members of the public would not have a pain in the head, never mind the pain we may be feeling in our bodies, when we think about the health service, because it would be simple.  We would not have to think about it; we would just go and get the service as we need it.</p>  <p>  Instead, we have this unbelievable, labyrinthine, shambolic, chaotic, failing system that even the Minister now has to acknowledge is failing and has to be reviewed.  Four and a half years after the big promises, we are going to review it all again.  I suggest that the review is a fundamental, root and branch abandoning of the privatised, private insurance model of delivering health care.  We need to move to something that works, which, whenever it has been done, is the national health service model.  That is what we need.  The sooner this Government or any Government cops on to that, the better.</p>  <p>  Of course, we can pay for that by just making those at the top pay a little bit more tax.  To be honest, I think everybody would be willing to pay a bit more if they knew they were going to get a health service that works.  The Government needs to make those at the top pay a fairer contribution towards the provision of the services we need for a civilised society.</p></speech>

The &euro;6 million he gave for the new accident and emergency facility at the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar means work is progressing there in a very satisfactory manner.  Another issue I have raised with him time and again is the development of step-down facilities at St. Joseph's hospital in Longford.  It would take great pressure off the services at the Midland Regional Hospital if this were to happen.  Hopefully, the Minister will have news on that in the not too distant future.</p><p>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015 is important legislation as it seeks to ensure that our older citizens and people with illnesses can afford health insurance and are not discriminated against by insurance companies in favour of younger, healthier people.  Throughout my time in the House, I have always found that the foremost theme associated with health care debates is equality.  This Bill relates to equality of insurance.</p><p>Risk equalisation was introduced in Ireland as a way of levelling the playing field between younger and older health insurance customers.  While there has been a long-running debate about the benefits and negatives of risk equalisation, I find that the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  For example, without risk equalisation, there is no incentive for insurance providers to cover the needs of older or less healthy people.  Indeed, like car insurance, premiums would be heavily risk-related on the age profile of consumers and no real equality would exist.  Therefore, I find myself in full agreement with comments made by the Department of Health about risk equalisation.  The Department is on the record as stating:</p><blockquote>The risk equalisation system protects the right of older people to purchase health insurance at a reasonable rate.  Without it, the competition in the market is distorted because insurers with a majority of senior citizens are at a significant disadvantage.</blockquote><p>I came across an interesting statistic while researching this legislation.  On 1 July 2015, there were 118,000 people with health insurance aged between 60 and 64.  If this legislation is enacted, the age at which credits are payable will rise from 60 to 65.  This will benefit insurers, like VHI, which have a much higher proportion of older customers than other insurers.  Therefore, not only is this legislation about ensuring equality for the consumer, it is also about ensuring equality for the providers of insurance and creating a better market for both the consumer and the supplier.</p><p>The issue of stamp duty charges is another important aspect of this legislation.  The reduction in stamp duty charges on non-advanced policies will make it cheaper for insurers to provide these products to customers.</p><p> The corresponding stamp duty levy will be reduced on products not providing advanced cover for an adult from &euro;240 to &euro;202, which is a reduction of &euro;38.  For a child, it stands at &euro;80 and goes back down to &euro;67, a reduction of &euro;13.  While this is to be warmly welcomed, it must be pointed out, as some Deputies have already, that the vast majority of people have advanced policies and these have only been adjusted by 1%.  We can all agree that 1% is very unlikely to have an effect on the prices for insurers or consumers.  I would like to see this particular area of the legislation being urgently addressed.</p> <p> There are two further points I would like to make.  The first concerns the reduction in the Health Insurance Authority levy.  The levy is set to be reduced to a rate of just 0.01% of insurers' premium income for the years 2015 and 2016.  This will result in savings for insurers of &euro;2 million in both years.  After that, the levy will be set at 0.09%, which is a substantial reduction on the current levels of 25%.  Second, I wish to pay a special tribute to Mr. Pat McLoughlin, with whom I worked closely on the old Midland Health Board.  He produced two reports on private health insurance.  I remember reading his first report, which was published in the run up to Christmas 2013.  This report outlined a scheme of life-time community rating and discounted rates for young adults.  I am pleased to see these recommendations are being acted on by the Minister and I look forward to reading Mr. McLoughlin's second report, which has just been published.</p> <p> I have touched on a few brief aspects of this legislation.  As I stated at the outset, this Bill is all about equality, particularly for our older citizens.  The major aim of the legislation is to make health insurance as affordable as possible, reducing the chance of a spike in premiums and ensuring that insurers who have a much higher proportion of older customers are also treated with fairness.</p> <p> Now is the right time to try to take a new approach towards health insurance and we are doing so with the legislation before us.  In addition, we are widening the scope by making it as equal as possible.  The Minister and his officials are to be commended on this progressive and reforming legislation.</p></speech>

He has accepted the findings of an ESRI report on the particular UHI model which was being considered.  It was found to be unaffordable and, therefore, the Minister will not pursue it.  This is about taking stock and it is a practical and reasonable position to take.  All the while, the Minister has confirmed his commitment to equalising universal health care, thus bringing a two-tier system to an end.  However, as well all know, this will not happen overnight.  It is not like declaring war.  One cannot declare universal health care; it is something that has to be knitted and weaved together.  One must put the foundation stones and the building blocks in place first.  Reasonable people know it is more than just about having universal health insurance to provide universal health care.  It is also about addressing issues such as capacity, resources and the management of those resources.</p>  <p>  I welcome some of the reforms the Government has already undertaken on the path towards universal health care.  These include free GP care for under-sixes and over-70s, as well as pushing forward with free GP care for under-12s.  In addition, the development of primary care centres will handle chronic illnesses in the community rather than being treated in accident and emergency departments.  If such conditions are not controlled and managed at primary care level, it can result in blocking acute hospital beds.  </p>  <p>  Hospitals groups have been established to achieve excellence of treatment by creating a confluence of expertise and sharing resources between hospitals in those groups.  I also wish to compliment the Minister for additional funding for the fair deal scheme for nursing home care.  In October 2014, 79 people in County Mayo were waiting to get into nursing homes.  I was acutely aware of it, with many people contacting my office.  Some people had to spend their own resources, which they simply could not afford to do.  A year later, only four people were on the waiting list which is now down to two to four weeks.</p>  <p>  There is continuous recruitment of nurses, doctors and consultants.  I was listened with amusement to Deputy Boyd Barrett who mentioned the high cost of consultants.  As we all know, however, wages and salaries paid to consultants, doctors and nurses here are not as attractive as in other countries.  To compound that, is Deputy Boyd Barrett actually suggesting that we should tax them more and use it to pay for the health service?  He is not in the real world at all; he is talking about a fantasy land with oppressive rich people.  We need to get these consultants, doctors and nurses because they make for a good health service.  We also must compete in an international market because our graduates are much sought after.</p>  <p>  Community services catering for those with dementia and Alzheimer's will require additional resources in future.  In addition, we must take care of the carers because invariably such medical conditions are progressive, so those affected require care on a 24-7 basis.  Some &euro;27.5 million was pledged for the provision of integrated dementia services, which was to be co-funded by the Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies.  I am concerned, however, because there are approximately 48,000 people with dementia and Alzheimer's in this country.  Some 63% of them are being cared for in the community, which in effect means in their own homes.  This money is, however, predominantly being spent in big centres of population, so only 500 families might benefit of the 30,000 people who are living with dementia at home and being supported by a community care policy.</p>  <p>  I understand that only 56 of those packages have been authorised, despite all that funding.  I am concerned because in County Mayo, we have an estimated 1,835 people with dementia but I am not aware that any of this funding is going to the county.  The county has an ageing population and a proportionately higher number of older people compared to other counties.  Given the projected figures for a rising number of people suffering from dementia, there will be an increased demand for such care services.  I would like to know what the regional spend is in this regard and how much is being spent in County Mayo.  The Minister may not have the answer to hand but it is important because there are many dementia patients in County Mayo.</p>  <p>  Caring for the carers means that as well as having integrated care packages, we should also provide respite for carers.  I am particularly concerned about a 12-bed respite care facility, Marian House in Ballindine, which is run by Western Alzheimer's.  It provides respite for 510 families in Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.  There is a waiting time of between eight to 12 weeks for them to get respite.  It is tailor-made care for people with Alzheimer's.  HIQA has been into that facility and has said it must have &euro;500,000 worth of works carried out to the premises, or it will have to scale down or possibly shut down in March 2016.  What assistance is available to such respite care homes under section 38?</p><p>I urge that assistance be made available to them.  I understand that they deal with the HSE.  There is no service within the HSE that is comparable with the service provided by Western Alzheimers.  It is doing a job where a gap in services provided by the HSE has been identified.  It would be very much to the detriment of Mayo, Roscommon and Galway if such a service was to close.  It would put huge pressure on these families, which are often put to the pin of their collar emotionally and financially in caring for their loved ones in their own homes.  </p> <p> The Minister may not be in a position to take any of those questions now or answer them in a fulsome way but I ask for a fair distribution of funding for integrated care packages tailor-made for people with dementia throughout the country - not just in Dublin or Cork.  Some of that funding should come to Mayo and the west.  I ask the Minister to look at respite care and the problems facing Marian House in Ballindine and take it up with the HSE.  I am very concerned about it.  There are a lot of volunteers in the community whose families have benefited from the service provided and who give passionate and strong testimony about the invaluable service and understanding provided by Western Alzheimers.  I would like to see it continue.  A lot of local fund-raising goes on as well but I do not know how it can possibly manage &euro;500,000 between now and then.  It needs some help and I am asking the Minister to take up this issue.</p></speech>

I am opposed to the Bill because I am opposed to the special protection afforded to private health insurance companies which profit off the backs of citizens in this country.   The Government&rsquo;s priority has never been to establish access to health care based on need as opposed to the ability to pay.  Instead, it has gleefully pushed the two-tier model left behind by flawed governments of the past.  Despite a nationwide call for a more compassionate health care system that does not abandon our elderly in the accident and emergency department corridors and that does not discriminate on the basis of ability to pay, we continue to bolster the health insurance industry.  The Government&rsquo;s inability to govern has meant a disintegrating health care system.  Its failure to respond adequately to the health needs of the nation is shown by policy after policy that not only fail desperately but cause real damage to people's health in our country.  While successive governments established the unfair two-tier system, this Government has pursued it, bringing inequality in access to health care to an unprecedented level.  It was this Government which was responsible for implementing a permanent risk equalisation scheme in 2013 when the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 commenced and it has since failed time and again to govern on the health issue.</p>  <p>  Despite an increase in health expenditure arising from this year's budget, health spending levels are still below pre-crisis levels by at least &euro;1 billion.  Free GP care for those over 70 is not sufficient to meet the health needs of elderly people.  The correct Government policy would have been to assign free medical cards to those over 70 covering a range of community services, including hospital visits, dental services, prescription medicine costs, hospital care, optical and aural services, social work services and other community services.  The Government also increased hospital charges, introduced new drug charges for medical card holders and increased charges for prescription items.  These were all introduced in response to the so-called economic crisis.  The Government's increase in drug charges was another step away from universal health care.  The Mapping the Pathways to Universal Healthcare project in 2014 showed that Irish citizens paid &euro;599 million more on prescription drugs and hospital charges than they did in 2007. </p>  <p>  The Minister's imposition of a deadline last May for those under 34 years of age to acquire health insurance is another failed policy and another step away from universal health care.  Anyone over the age of 35 who cannot afford private health insurance will be discriminated against on the basis of their age and inability to pay.  In 2012, the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, introduced a target of nine months for hospital appointments.  In 2014, the Minister doubled that target to 18 months and admitted even that it was unambitious.  There are now more people waiting for outpatient, inpatient and day case hospital appointments than there were in 2012.  This is a sad indictment.    Furthermore, the Minister also failed in his suggestion that private companies could be allowed take over the management of under-performing public hospitals under future health service reforms.  Is this the real model we are going to see in respect of the Minister's universal health insurance policy where hospitals will be handed over to private companies and a licence to print money is granted to them?</p>  <p>  The Minister has also proposed that newly formed hospital groups should have the freedom to make collective agreements and negotiate independent contracts with staff "outside of the constraints of public sector rules in the way semi-State companies do now".  Should they should also in his view be allowed to put the running of those hospitals out to tender because that seems to be way he will pursue the privatisation of health services?</p>  <p>  At least one positive element emerged this week with the Government abandoning the plan to introduce universal health insurance with a multi-payer competing model.  This model, which is based on the Dutch model, would have been disastrous for us.  It would have seen the complete handover of control of the operation of our health service to the private sector.  Perhaps that is something Fine Gael would like to see but it would have been a disaster and I welcome the fact that it has been abandoned.  However, I am very worried that we will see an underhand development whereby the hospitals I mentioned earlier will be handed over individually on a piece-by-piece basis to private operators who can profit from them.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of this Bill which is another step away from universal health care by expanding on the lifetime community rating model which will only exacerbate the inequality of our two-tier health system.  It privileges the access of private patients over public patients and is a step backwards on the road to universal health care, propping-up the profits of private health insurance companies and our two-tier system of health care.  </p>  <p>  What have all these disastrous policies done to people across Ireland?  They have increased inequality in our health system through propping up the private health care system.  What we need is a universal health care system.  This can be brought about by establishing a fully functioning primary care model.  People's health security is depleting and their health is in jeopardy.  It was the Government's policies over the past four to five years that increased the costs of health care and reduced access for those who need it, which has left the prevalence of illness in this country still nowhere near under control. </p>  <p>  The first Healthy Ireland survey provides up-to-date figures on the extent of illness in Ireland.  Previous health research was cancelled due to austerity measures so this is the first data available since 2007.  The nationally representative survey of 7,539 people found that 28% of the population has a health problem or long-standing illness, 19% are limited in their daily activities due to ill health and 43% had a health issue in the past year.  The Irish Cancer Society published The Real Cost of Cancer Care, a  survey of 409 people that shows the real costs of having a prevalent disease like cancer.  A total of 35,000 people will be diagnosed with cancer this year.  The survey found that the average additional cost of cancer was &euro;862 per month and 40% of those surveyed did not have a medical card.</p>  <p>  Regional health inequality has further marginalised people in rural constituencies.  There is now a significant shortfall and geographical disparity in the supply of GPs and health inequality is becoming an increasing problem.  We are witnessing a declining proportion of GPs working in rural areas, particularly in County Donegal.  It has declined from 33% in the early 1990s to 22% in 2005.  In County Donegal there are 48 to 57.7 GPs per 100,000 of population.  The Government must recognise the peripheral nature of counties like Donegal in order to retain GPs in rural areas and restore the rural practice allowance to maintain GPs in our counties.   </p>  <p>  It is clear that we must move away from a privatisation model towards a universal one based on the need of services.  The only way to achieve this is through the development of a primary care system with universal health care at its core.  However, primary care has been talked about for over a decade now with very little results.  Research has consistently proven that primary care is the best system, both in terms of equal access and cost effectiveness.</p><p>Strong primary care is associated with better population health, lower rates of unnecessary hospitalisations and relatively lower socio-economic inequality.  Countries with strong primary care spend less on health care.  However, Ireland's is the only EU health system that does not offer universal coverage for primary care.</p> <p> Once again, the Minister is pushing further away the idea of a universal, single-tiered health service, which guarantees access based on need, not income.  How can the promotion of greater uptake of private insurance and ensuring the structure of life-time community rating in our health system be seen as a step towards universal health care?  Increasing the numbers of people with health insurance contradicts the notion of universal health care. </p> <p> Today, there is still no right to health care in the Constitution or through any statutory provision even though Ireland is a signatory to Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which recognises "the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".  Unless we recognise and vindicate that right, we will never provide a universal health care system in this State.</p></speech>

The Bill promotes what the Government sees as a cost-effective private health insurance market without moving to a clear timetable for the introduction of universal health insurance.  It makes clear in one sense that mandatory private health insurance is still the Government's goal.  The taxpayers who are being incentivised to purchase private cover already fund the health system.  The one third of their salaries taken in tax pays for the provision of hospitals, doctors and nurses.  The Government is attempting in this Bill to dupe them into not realising that private health cover is effectively double taxation.  That approximately 300,000 people have left the private health insurance market since 2008 speaks volumes.  Many who managed to hold on to it are struggling to do so.  They are terrified by the prospect of ridiculously long waiting lists, particularly for non-life threatening illnesses.  None the less that has the potential to make their lives miserable.  Almost 1,000 people have been waiting for over two years for outpatient appointments at the University Hospital Waterford, despite numerous promises from the Minister for Health and his predecessor that these waiting lists would be tackled.  I and many others believe that people are not signing up for the privilege of a private room in a hospital as private cover guarantees the insured in many hospitals in Europe.  For most procedures, regardless of the level of cover, the patient will be put in a ward in a public hospital, like it or not.  I have spoken to many in the past few months who had the top level of health insurance but that did not matter.</p>  <p>  Many of the 100,000 who bought private cover over the past 12 months to beat the new deadline that would have made it more expensive as they got older did so as their confidence declined and they had a sense of panic about what was happening in the public system.  They did not sign up because they thought they were getting a bargain, as many Ministers and Government public relations attempted to portray it to the media.  Many have no choice but to have private health insurance because they know the consequences of going through the public system, with waiting lists for elective surgery or to see a specialist or consultant.</p>  <p>  Some of the previous speakers said that consultants are not getting the money they should get.  This is probably one of the few countries in the world where consultants do not work weekends or do shift work.  It is outrageous.  If a person has a heart attack at the weekend in Waterford, he or she is sent to Cork or Dublin because at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., there is nobody there, apart from a consultant on call and a patient is lucky to get him or her.  I do not know what the opinion polls show but when people analyse what is happening in the health system after this length of time and all the money supposedly spent, they will realise that they are afraid to turn up in a hospital because they may have to wait to be looked after.  I have brought two or three examples to the Minister&rsquo;s attention of the dire consequences of not having a specialist on duty.  In one case, a man who had four stents complained of chest pains but as there was no consultant, he was seen by a doctor in the accident and emergency department who took approximately 30 minutes to get there, through no fault of his own.  The coronary ward was full and he could not get into it.  The man died.  While I am not saying he would have survived had there been a consultant in the hospital, he did not have the chance he deserved.  There are people waiting in the long grass on this issue.  That man's family, who have appeared on "Prime Time", were not necessarily supporters of mine or anti-Government.  I do not know what their politics were but it is a big family and they are aggrieved and in a state of shock and turmoil because of what happened to their father.  This is serious in many hospitals.  I can only speak for what is happening in the hospital in Waterford.  Nothing is being done despite all the promises made about regeneration of the hospital services with 24-hour coronary care.  That has not happened and will not happen this weekend when somebody might have a heart attack.</p>  <p>  There is a generation of people with private health insurance who are already financially crippled by the universal social charge, colossal mortgages, property tax, and the list goes on.  As far as I can gather from this Bill, and the Minister can correct me, it will not guarantee that the cost of insurance will go down at all.  It will go up and insurers can put it up if they wish but there is no guarantee it will go down.  Insurers will be allowed to retain discretion on whether to introduce higher rates.  The health insurance levy went up 149% in the past five years.  The Minister says he hopes to create a culture of competition between private providers.  That is not good enough because he and I know that will not happen.  It will go up and it is unlikely that it will go down.  If it goes down momentarily, it will go back up. </p>  <p>  Another disappointing aspect of the Bill is that it does not address pre-existing conditions.  These will not be covered for up to five years by a private health insurer.  If a person wishes to upgrade, and no doubt many will because the entry level provides very basic cover, insurers will be allowed to restrict cover for any medical condition that existed prior to the previous level of cover for at least two years.  That should be reconsidered.  I do not know what it means but it is terrible.  Bringing forward the Bill is the Government&rsquo;s attempt to create a sense of urgency and panic, coupled with the problem of waiting lists and the overall decline in the public system.  It is scaremongering many young people into purchasing health insurance that they cannot afford.</p><p> It is all very well for those of us in opposition to be critical, and the Minister is right to say that at times we can be critical and do not offer alternatives.  Some of us do but some of us just posture.  I do not make derogatory remarks against any Minister or member of the Government but on the issue of health, we are nearing the end of 2015 and the start of 2016 and while there is no question that the previous Government bears much of the responsibility for what happened in the health service, the Minister is completely wide off the mark in that he has not listened to people who work in the health service or to people like myself and other Deputies who are inundated every week with calls to our constituency offices and who meet people in our constituency offices who are strapped for cash and cannot get even the basic care they need.  The quality of life in any society is based to a large degree on the standard of education and health and while I am not speaking about the issue of education, we cannot but say that the health service is in meltdown.  If one speaks to any people who have been in hospitals around the country, they will say that the health service is in a critical state, with waiting lists to try to get access to the service.  In a western country if we cannot depend on a consultant to help save someone who has a heart attack on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, that says it all.</p></speech>

Despite that privileged position, and despite the long run-in it had in terms of the change brought about by EU deregulation of health insurance, it failed to accumulate the reserves required of the private sector and now requires a subsidy from its competitors to stay afloat.</p>  <p>  My purpose here is not to criticise the VHI, of which I have been a member for over 50 years, and will remain one.  I want the VHI to survive and prosper but I worry that we may be subsidising it for inefficiency, therefore losing all the possible benefits of competition.  I realise that is due to the almost impossible task of trying to extract the extra cost of its carrying older people from, for instance, knowing the extra cost of carrying those older people if we had full competition.  Consequently, it behoves us as legislators to inform ourselves and be constantly vigilant about a risk equalisation scheme and its accompanying stamp duty levy.</p>  <p>  When it was first introduced, the levy on every insured person's premium was &euro;160; I believe that was in 2009.  Since then the total amount paid in levies by insured persons of all insurance companies is over &euro;2.5 billion.  It would not be accurate to say that has been the price of competition but it has been the loss to consumers of the potential benefits of competition.  I am aware that is due to the fact that existing providers were sucking up all the young health insurance seekers.</p>  <p>  When we interfere in the market for good reason, which we all know is to protect the investment in VHI over the years and to ensure that it will have money to pay for older people like myself and the Ceann Comhairle, we must be sure that competition has brought at least some benefits to all those insured.  We rely totally on the Health Insurance Authority to guarantee the benefits of competition.  It is its job, in addition to advising on the risk equalisation payments, but I wonder if equal attention is given to both objectives.  I do not know that and I wonder if it is even knowable.</p>  <p>  One of the important measures in this Bill, which I welcome, is to change what is considered to be the measure of health status for the purposes of determining the levy and the risk payment, and including day cases as well as hospital nights as an indicator.  The Minister said earlier that 30% of hospital activity now consists of day cases, so it should be included, and I agree it should incentivise more efficient use of our hospitals.  However, how is it expected that it will have no significant impact on the levy?  I read a quote from the Department that it did not expect this to have any impact on the levy.  I do not understand how that can be the case.  I appreciate that excluding the age cohort from 60 to 65 will have a mitigating impact on the levy but will it be enough to offset a one-third increase in the number of cases?  In, say, two years time when this is bedded in, I wonder if we will be able to say that it has had little impact on the consumer price of health insurance.  Increasing the age threshold for risk equalisation payments will benefit the provider with most older people.  If there is any possibility that these payments have any element of subsidising inefficiency, this change means we run the risk of increasing and reinforcing that inefficiency.</p>  <p>  There is one other aspect of the legislation which I very much welcome and believe is a measure to reduce the danger of subsidising the form of monopoly over and above the necessary subsidy required by the different age profiles.  That is the move towards creating diagnosis groups in an effort to get a more refined measure of health status.  I understand that this cannot be introduced until better data collection methods are available but it at least demonstrates an awareness of the dangers of looking mainly at the different age profile.</p>  <p>  I am not opposed to any of the measures in the Bill but I want to reiterate my concern about the possible pitfalls of risk equalisation and its impact on competition.  I would point to a number of reasons that should concern all of us and why they should continue to command constant vigilance by this and future Ministers.  First, since the liberalisation of the market kicked in, several new operators have come and gone and only this week we heard that another operator is to sell on.  The only provider still standing is the one which is the major recipient of the levy.  I do not know if there is any causal relationship between those two facts but we have to ask if there is such a relationship.</p>  <p>  Second, many people mentioned the report published this week on universal health insurance.  It is taken as a given that it is not as imminent as we previously thought.  That makes it all the more important to ensure that the system of health insurance we do have works as efficiently as possible for consumers who are paying dearly for it, and will continue to pay dearly for it.</p>  <p>  Third, in the context of the many people in recent years who left insurance and the young people who chose not to take out insurance during the worst of the recession, two measures were introduced to bring them back in.  One was a reduction in premium for very young entrants to entice them back in and the other was a late entry loading for anyone who had not taken out insurance before the age of 35.</p><p>This was done with very good reason, which I perfectly understand, and what is more, it is working.  When we consider that the purpose of setting up this whole complicated and arcane risk-equalisation scheme was to ensure community rating, in other words that everybody would be charged the same, I do not know if anybody else sees the irony in the situation where saving community rating means doing away with it for these groups.  So we will now be charged differently from everybody else.</p> <p> I know it is working, but the point I am making is what a tangled web we weave when we interfere in or try to second-guess the market.  I accept completely that compensating for different age profiles is a very difficult task, but that is not to deny the need for it for the moment.  Presumably, eventually the age profiles will themselves equalise and we will not need a risk-equalisation scheme.  We really need to monitor this scheme extremely carefully and ongoing vigilance is absolutely necessary.  To the extent that the measures in the Bill will help to ensure the scheme works as efficiently as possible for consumers, I very much welcome it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900033#FF00200"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and the broad support from most parties for the Bill.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that some of those who spoke against the Bill and intend to vote against it have got the wrong end of the stick.  They seem to suggest that the Bill is designed to support or subsidise the health insurance industry.  That is not the case; the purpose of the Bill is to underpin community rating, which prevents health insurers from charging older people, people with poor health status or sicker people more than they charge anyone else.  That is why I am somewhat confused over why people might oppose the Bill.</p>  <p>  I can understand that some people who believe in a public-only system may wish to abolish health insurance altogether.  I do not agree; I believe people should be allowed to spend their own money on their own health if they so wish, as we allow them to do in all sorts of other spheres.</p>  <p>  A fully public system based on need and not ability to pay would still require some level of rationing.  All health services have some level of rationing, some level of waiting lists or some level of exclusion criteria because certain interventions are not cost effective.  Are we really suggesting to people that they must accept that they cannot use their own money on their own health?  I do not agree with that.  In a free society if people want to spend their money on their own health, their children's education or whatever, they should be allowed to do so.  That is why I think the debate about a single-tier system versus a two-tier system misunderstands the reality of health care.</p>  <p>  Even in countries with extensive and advanced national health services, for example, the United Kingdom, people still have health insurance, where 10% to 15% of people take out insurance through BUPA which allows them to skip queues, have the consultant of their choice or have their treatment in a private hospital.  Unless we were to outlaw private medicine and outlaw health insurance then we need some sort of legislation to underpin it and regulate it.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that health insurers cannot discriminate against older people or people with poor health status.  I would have thought that on that basis, those who purport to support equality and social justice should be supporting the Bill and not opposing it, unless it really is their contention that they wish to make it illegal for people to spend their own money on their own health should they so wish and to outlaw private medicine altogether.  I am not aware of any democratic country that has ever done that.</p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Bill is to specify the risk-equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duty levies, from 1 March 2016.  The Bill will set credits for the 60 to 64 age group at zero, while increasing the credits payable for those aged over 65.  The Bill also provides for an improvement in the health status measure under the scheme by expanding the setting in which a utilisation credit will be payable to include day-case admissions.  This increases the support provided by the scheme to all less healthy insured people.  In response to Deputy Mitchell, it does not affect the levy because the levy is set in law.  It may affect premiums, which is a different thing.  However, I do not think it should have a major impact on premiums given that it is a relatively small measure.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a utilisation credit for all day-case admissions to hospital increases the support provided under the scheme for less healthy people of all ages.  The credits provided are set at low enough levels to retain the incentive for insurers to minimise hospital stays where appropriate and to implement the most cost effective, clinically appropriate treatment pathways.  The reduction in stamp duty for non-advanced contracts supports the provision of lower cost entry level products and will support the sustainability of the market.  These changes, coupled with the ongoing increases in employment which is a key driver in the demand for health insurance, will support the market and everyone wishing to avail of private health insurance.</p>  <p>  A particular issue was raised on overcompensation and profit.  Overcompensation arises if an undertaking, a health insurer, that is a net beneficiary of the risk equalisation system makes a profit that exceeds a reasonable profit over a three-year period.  Reasonable profit is defined as a return on equity not exceeding 12% per annum on a rolling three-year basis, using approved accounting standards and having regard to the European Union framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation.</p>  <p>  The avoidance of overcompensation is a fundamental part of the risk-equalisation scheme.  In recommending the level of credits to be provided to insurers, the Health Insurance Authority must have regard to the aim of avoiding overcompensation or excess profits.  The authority is also required to assess whether the risk-equalisation scheme overcompensates any insurer.  Once a year, by 1 May, insurers are required to provide the authority with profit and loss accounts and balance sheets in so far as they relate to Irish health insurance business.</p>  <p>  The authority assesses if any insurer has been overcompensated by risk equalisation, enabling it to earn in excess of a reasonable profit.  If the authority determines under the Health Insurance Acts that an insurer, which is a net beneficiary of the risk equalisation scheme, has been overcompensated, a draft report is issued to the insurer.  The authority will then take account of any submissions received from that insurer before making a final determination on overcompensation.  If the authority determines that overcompensation has occurred, it issues a report to the Minister and the insurer concerned stating the amount of the overcompensation.  The insurer must then refund the amount of overcompensation to the risk equalisation fund.  No overcompensation has occurred to date under the scheme.  To the end of 2014, profit as a percentage of earned premium in the market is 3.3%.</p>  <p>  I again thank the Deputies for their contributions and their broad support for the Bill.</p></speech>

I will let him off and will not go back to where we ended up last night.  It is obviously difficult to pick up a slot midway through having made half the points last night and having to conclude them this afternoon.  The point I was making when we adjourned last night was that to allow dances is appropriate, but that exemption should only be dealt with in a spirit of accommodating religious liberty.</p>  <p>  The problem we have with this issue is as a direct consequence of the undue influence of the Catholic Church in the provision of essential State services and a legacy issue with that in terms of hospital care, education and so on.  Everybody needs access to schools and hospitals.  The religious ethos of an organised religion or its believers should never be allowed to interfere with a citizen's right to health or education.  That is the starting point of this.</p>  <p>  For example, Savita Halappanavar's husband, Praveen, should never have been told in a Galway hospital that this was a Catholic country and that his wife was not entitled to a termination of pregnancy.  It should have had nothing to do with the provision of services in a State-funded hospital.</p><p>Section 37 exemptions have been given, which have allowed the Catholic Church to discriminate in cases where it believed an employee was not upholding the ethos of the school or hospital.  In certain instances, that is appropriate.  If it was an entirely Catholic-funded institution and the job was, for example, to teach the Catholic religion, there would have a basis for discrimination but in any other situation, it would not.</p> <p> While I welcome the Bill and the fact we are beginning to discuss discrimination, it does not go far enough.  What we should be saying is that educational and medical institutions, which are funded by the State, should be taken out of the remit of section 37 altogether.  Those institutions have a wider role in society.  They are funded by the taxpayer and equal access should exist regardless of religious beliefs.  In a hospital, there is no occupational reason only a person of faith could do a medical or administrative job.  Similarly, there is no occupational reason in State schools.  It is linked to the provision of chaplains or spiritual advisers in those institutions, which should be a matter for the religions and not be funded by the State.  The Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is aware of work done by Atheist Ireland in this regard.  It has highlighted the case of institutes of technology, which were established on an entirely secular model and have no religious functions, and yet we know hundreds of thousands of euro in taxpayers' money is being used to fund Catholic chaplains in a number of the institutions.  That is simply not good enough.</p> <p> The provision in the Bill about the prohibition on discrimination by landlords against rent supplement recipients is welcome but while it will stop landlords putting up a notice to the effect that no rent supplement applicant need apply, it does very little else in terms of preventing discrimination against those in receipt of rent supplement.  The ability of landlords to discriminate against them on an ongoing basis could continue but more "discreetly", for the want of a better word.  The situation of tenants has been made incredibly more vulnerable by the Government&rsquo;s fudging and mishandling of the rent situation of late, which is most worrying.  The Government could be doing a lot more in that regard.</p> <p> The final issue I wish to address is the question of why the Bill is not more comprehensive than it is.  It is a confusing, miscellaneous piece of legislation.  When we talk about equality provisions, that is a recognition that equality really means treating different people differently.  That is being equal.  I do not understand why we have not been all-encompassing in the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  I note that the Bill makes a slight reference to retirement age, making the point that it is not discriminatory to have different ages for different fixed-term contracts but it does not deal with the issue before the House currently, namely, the abolition of compulsory or mandatory retirement, which is a far bigger issue for older citizens.  It is a bit mad that a committee of the Houses conducted hearings yesterday with Age Action Ireland and other bodies to try to address this very important issue while we have legislation before us dealing with equality that touches on the retirement age but does not address it.  That is bad planning on the part of the House.  What is being sought in Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s Bill, which is a matter on which many older citizens feel strongly, is the elimination of the maximum age in employment contracts.  If there is a need to have a maximum age in a particular occupation, then that could be legally justified.  In the normal course of events, for example, if it required a super level of physical fitness, that would be allowed.  However, to have a contract with a compulsory retirement age is a measure people have long sought to review.  That is not in any way pandering to this unfortunate trend in society where people have to work longer in order to secure a decent standard of living but that is a slightly separate argument.  I would like the Minister of State to address why the abolition of the compulsory or mandatory retirement age is not included in the Bill and whether he would be open to including it because it would be a far more preferable way forward.</p> <p> I echo some of the points made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn last night in terms of the absence of rights and equality for disabled citizens.  It is regrettable and I would like to see more progress in that regard.  I am pleased the Bill has been brought before the House but we are only on Second Stage and we could make it considerably better.  We could make it better for lesbian, gay and atheist teachers by removing educational and medical institutions altogether from the remit of section 37 but we could also make the situation better for older citizens, disabled citizens and others who have an equal right to demand equality, as we are not giving them as much attention as we should.</p></speech>

However, the provisions in the Bill are still very inadequate.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance introduced a Bill some months ago in Private Members' time to repeal section 37 and it contained different provisions from those outlined in the Bill before the House.</p>  <p>  My first question is why the State is differentiating between people employed by a religious institution or a medical institution in the public or private sectors.  We do not allow discrimination by private sector employers and do not exempt them from other employment laws.  For example, we do not exempt Dunnes Stores from recognising trade unions.  I still do not understand why the Government is saying that only publicly-funded education or medical institutions can discriminate on religious grounds where the treatment does not constitute discrimination on any of the other discriminatory grounds.  What it means is that there can still be discrimination in private organisations against lesbian and gay people and the State will not do anything about it because it is a private religious group.  We made it clear in the Anti-Austerity Alliance&rsquo;s Bill that the provisions would apply to public and private organisations but we recognise that there is a religious requirement in certain occupations, for example, to be a chaplain, but that the requirement should not apply to other occupations.</p>  <p>  Is it still okay to discriminate against atheists and people who do not profess a religion because that is exactly what the Bill will still allow?  It seems that there is pussy-footing going on about schools that are still under religious patronage, which is the majority of schools in this country.  I have a genuine question that must be answered because it will be asked.  I know many primary schoolteachers who are atheists, who do not believe in any religion, but they are forced by their occupation to instruct Catholic teaching and assist with ceremonies such as first communion, or they try to avoid that class.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, think that is acceptable?  We must tackle religious control over schools that makes teachers fit in with religious instruction.  That is wrong.  It is a human right not to have a religion and not to be forced to believe in a certain religion or to have to pretend to believe in one.  The Bill will continue to allow such teachers to be discriminated against and not to be promoted or not to be employed in the first place.  We must say that is not okay.</p>  <p>  We are dealing with the chilling effect of legislation on LGBT teachers, nurses and other professions, although it mainly applies to teaching.  It is not the case that teachers are sacked.  We know teachers have not been sacked according to that criterion.</p><p>It is more the case of a chat with the principal on a Monday morning, a discussion about toning it down, checking oneself in order that one does not appear to be gay and not giving any student the impression one is gay.<br/><br/>A huge number of issues remain for teachers.  Is it possible that people will be discriminated against through the back door?  There have been many cases in the United States of Catholic-run schools, which obviously are private schools, in which teachers were sacked because they were gay.  While people knew they were gay for a number of years, when they got married they had publicly made their position clear - by marrying someone of the same sex - and those teachers were then sacked.  However, it could also be found that somebody is not carrying out the ethos of the school because he or she is gay.  Consequently, Members must challenge the entire education system in Ireland that allows schools to implement a particular religious ethos and to force employees to go along with that.<br/><br/>The Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2015 pertaining to section 37 was introduced by the Anti-Austerity Alliance and it extended the Employment Equality Act to all workers in services operated by religious institutions or under their direction.  The only discrimination allowed would be in the religious organisation itself, where the position was a religious one, such as a priest, a preacher or whatever and these also are the only grounds that should obtain in this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to bring forward the Anti-Austerity Alliance Bill to Committee Stage as well, to enable the committee discuss both Bills because I believe ours is better.  This is not a point-scoring issue but at the time, Anti-Austerity Alliance Members raised the point that such issues should not arise.<br/><br/>As for other issues that should be brought forward, I was very surprised the Minister of State did not use the opportunity provided by a miscellaneous Bill to deal with the issue about which parents were protesting outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday, namely, that schools can require a child to prove he or she is of a certain religion to secure a place in that school, that is, the baptismal certificate scenario.  A simple repeal of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act could have been included in this Bill and that would then have addressed a huge issue.  It is a major issue in my constituency, which has a multiethnic and a multi-religious population, as well as school shortages.  This is when the baptismal certificate issue tends to be invoked but even were that not the case, parents should have choice about where they send their children to school and should not be obliged to sign up to admissions policies in schools.  I have seen admissions policies for some schools in my constituency that would oblige me to lie to get my daughter into them, with requirements like believing in the Holy Spirit and so on.  Some of them still are living in the Dark Ages and given that parents are required to go along with this when the population is much changed, why did the Minister of State not use this opportunity?  I saw Labour Party Members outside the gates yesterday meeting those parents and giving a commitment they would address this issue but this Bill is the perfect place in which to so do.  It would be quite simple, in that one would repeal that section of the Equal Status Act that allows schools to use religion as grounds for admission.<br/><br/>The other issue I wished to raise is the provision on rent supplement.  I am delighted that discrimination in respect of rent supplement is being outlawed but the horse has bolted in this regard.  While it is great that people will be unable to discriminate in the advertisements on<i>Daft.ie</i>or wherever people are looking, I refer to the scenario in which 20 people are in a queue for accommodation.  I am told that getting rental accommodation is now like an audition for &quot;The X Factor&quot;.  One is placed before a panel of people and is quizzed about where one works, how much one earns, etc.  Consequently, a simple process will be able to make null and void this change in the law whereby landlords will not advertise it but will simply exercise it.  The reason they will be able to exercise such discretion is because there is such a shortage of rental accommodation.  This must be remedied immediately by providing affordable and social housing, by bringing in rent controls and taking other serious measures to deal with the housing crisis, on which Members debated at length in the House over the past two nights.  Unfortunately, however, many Government Members were not present for that debate.  Nevertheless these are the only ways in which to outlaw such discrimination on rent allowance in reality.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter.  I do not see why one should discriminate between public and private organisations, as the law should apply no matter for whom one works.  The only reason I would maintain any right to discriminate would be in respect of a role that requires religion.  If it does not require religion, one should have no right to discriminate.  This would be a lot simpler and would protect people in many occupations.  I again ask why discrimination is still being allowed against people who do not profess any religion and why teachers are being required to jump through hoops.  One can still envisage people not being promoted or being discriminated against unless these changes are carried through.</p></speech>

First, the changes to section 37 are welcome.  While the wording is not ideal, I understand there is a limit because of the directive and consequently, it was not as open to change as perhaps would have been desired.  Nevertheless, this legislation is moving Members along from a previous position and in many ways, the public has been ahead of the Oireachtas on many of these topics.  Most people would find reprehensible the idea that one could be discriminated against on the basis of some of the grounds outlined here.  This is a very positive development.</p>  <p>  One issue that is not included in this Bill concerns access to schools for children who do not have baptismal certificates in a system in which 95% of schools are under Roman Catholic patronage.  Honesty is a value one should be fostering among people and asking people to be dishonest simply to get their children into school is in conflict with such patronage and its values, which I find to be very odd.  I am not religious myself and would describe myself perhaps as a humanist or an agnostic or something like that but in common with others like myself, this does not stop us from having values that are fairly honourable in terms of telling the truth and so on.  The idea that one must have a religious moral standard of some sort is different to the reality of contemporary Ireland.</p>  <p>  To revert to the Bill, it is difficult to get one's head around the idea that gay people, divorced parents, unmarried parents or a woman who has had an abortion all offered potential grounds for being technically dismissed, particularly from organisations that preach tolerance.  I suspect many of the institutions will be pleased to see this change and I do not believe Members necessarily are grating against them.  Moreover, it is important that one works towards changing things progressively.  On the area pertaining to refusing people a home on the basis of the rent allowance, while we have many laws in Ireland their enforcement becomes problematic.  I worry about people as the first thing that will be on someone's mind will be to try to get a place anywhere.  When one begins to consider the organs of the State, such as for example the Private Residential Tenancies Board, it is overwhelmed at present and one must question how effective it will be in the short term.  I suspect people will keep on ploughing ahead to try to find alternative accommodation and will not make the complaints.  For example, I am starting to see changes in the way in which accommodation is being advertised.</p><p>I am not opposed to this being included but I want it to be included in a way that is meaningful and can bring about a change in culture and practice.  We are now seeing in advertisements requests for work references and so on, which in many ways is shifting the dynamic of the refusal.  We need to be careful about that to ensure it does not prevent us getting to the point we are trying to get to.  The key issue for me is how this is going to be enforced.</p></speech>

Mental health, for many reasons and in many respects, is a complex and emotive issue.  It is encouraging that, in my time as Minister of State, I have generally found a consensus in both Houses to improve the area of mental health, including implementation of the widely supported policy, A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  This Government has consistently prioritised investment in mental health and the HSE has been steadily implementing change on the ground.  While I remain as open as ever to constructive criticism or realistic suggestions, I ask that objectivity and, above all, the best interests of service-users remain paramount today.  Reform of mental health services has led to much needed additional investment but it also requires new approaches to enable the capacity of our system, in terms of new delivery models, to realise a common vision.  This ranges from overcoming staff recruitment and retention issues to rebalancing services at local level between acute and community-based care in order to achieve the objectives of A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  The implementation difficulties we face on the ground in some areas, which I have often acknowledged in the past, do not relate primarily to a lack of money.  As I have indicated on many occasions, it is more a question of change catching up with the funding provided.  This Government has provided &euro;125 million ring-fenced funding between 2012 and the end of this year to develop and enhance our mental health services.  The aim is to ensure that services are person-centred, user-friendly, responsive to need and recovery orientated.  I am pleased that I have secured a further &euro;35 million for 2016 to continue this important work. </p>  <p>  To date, a key focus has been additional posts to strengthen community mental health teams for both adults and children.  This funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, the forensic mental health services and suicide prevention initiatives.  Some 1,150 new posts have been approved since 2012.  Over 90% of the posts approved for 2012 and 2013 are in place and 110 of the 250 posts allocated for 2014 have been filled or are under offer.</p>  <p>  Many areas have seen great advances, including those that have embraced the Recovery agenda, the expansion of the forensic services, including the achievement of planning for the new forensic hospital at Portrane, and the ongoing reconfiguration of both adult, and child and adolescent teams countrywide.  Other achievements include the development of the counselling in primary care service, CIPC, for adults over 18 years, who are medical card holders; the implementation of national clinical programmes; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society; publication earlier this year of the expert review group report on the Mental Health Act 2001; and the new suicide prevention strategy, Connecting for Life.</p>  <p>  Waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services is an area of particular interest to me.  Last March, I asked the HSE to undertake a detailed validation of the waiting lists with the aim of minimising waiting times and, in particular, reducing the number of those waiting over 12 months.  This exercise involved the introduction of a new standard operating procedure for both inpatient and community CAMHS services.  I am pleased to note that good progress has been made and that the HSE has given a commitment to eliminate the over 12 month list entirely by the end of this year.  In this regard, the latest figures from the HSE indicate a reduction from 479 in March to 214 at the end of September in the over 12 months waiting category, a decrease of 55%.  The number of cases waiting over three months has also decreased over the same period.  There has also been a significant improvement in the number and range of CAMHS services at community and inpatient level over the past number of years.  There are now 58 operational CAMHS beds across four units in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  This represents an increase of almost 400% in the number of beds over eight years, from a figure of just 12 beds for the whole country in 2007.  Furthermore, an additional eight beds will become available in early December when the new Linn Dara facility opens.</p>  <p>  A priority issue for me is address of children and adolescents having, at times, to be admitted to adult acute units.  Figures for 2014 indicate that there were 89 admissions of children to adult psychiatric units, with the majority being voluntary and involving parental consent.  While these inappropriate admissions have decreased continuously in recent years, from a peak of 247 admissions in 2008, I believe there is still room for improvement.</p><p>The Health Service Executive is monitoring carefully all potential admissions to adult units to avoid this as much as possible.  However, in some cases, it may be the only available option if an adolescent is to obtain early treatment.</p> <p> Another topic to which I attach great importance is legislation in the area of mental health.  Such legislation provides the necessary safeguards and protections on which people rely if the State uses its power to detain them because they are suffering from a severe mental illness.  The report of the expert group set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 was published in March this year.  Government approval has been received for the drafting of a general scheme of a Bill to amend the existing legislation to reflect the recommendations of the expert group.  Work is progressing in the Department on these important amendments.  In addition, Government approval has been received for an early change to the existing legislation in respect of the use of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.  The effect of this change will be to remove the authority to administer ECT without consent in any circumstance where an involuntary patient is capable of giving consent but is unwilling to do so.  The heads of the short Bill relating to ECT have been agreed in recent days with the Attorney General's office and, subject to securing D&aacute;il time for this priority measure, it is my intention to bring it to the Oireachtas in December.  Work is ongoing on the heads of the larger amending Bill.</p> <p> Another important subject I have prioritised during my term of office is the issue of suicide.  We are all aware that suicide remains far too prevalent in our society and is a complex problem which requires a multifaceted solution.  While there are no easy answers to the problem, we can and must make every effort to reduce the number of lives lost to suicide by ensuring there is co-ordinated partnership among a broad range of Departments, State agencies, non-statutory organisations and, perhaps most importantly, through the involvement of local communities in tackling the issue.  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm has been and continues to be a priority for the Government.  Earlier this year we launched Connecting for Life, our new strategy to reduce suicide, covering the period 2015 to 2020.  The strategy which has an implementation focus on youth mental health sets out a vision in which fewer lives are lost through suicide and communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  This includes a greater focus on the important issue of support for families and communities in suicide prevention and will involve providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training in effective suicide prevention.</p> <p> For those who might ask what good another strategy can achieve, I emphasise that Connecting for Life is much more than a vision.  It provides a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual objective.  The plan will be supported by robust implementation and governance structures, as well as resourcing and communications frameworks.  Monitoring and evaluation will be embedded into the implementation process and the National Office for Suicide Prevention has been given a clear role and authority to support implementation of the strategy. </p> <p> Having noted the progress made in recent years, I take the opportunity to outline to the House my plans and priorities for next year.  As I mentioned, a further &euro;35 million is available to us to continue our development work.  Next year, in addition to continuing the development of general adult teams and child and adolescent health services, as well as improved 24-7 response and liaison services, priority will be given to the continued development of early intervention and prevention counselling services by HSE mental health and primary care staff, especially for young people.  Investment in clinical programmes will continue, including in two new clinical programmes.  One of these programmes will deal with ADHD in adults and children, while the other will deal with dual diagnosis of those with a mental illness and substance misuse problems, an issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has raised on numerous occasions in this Chamber.  There will be continued development of services in the area of psychiatry of later life and for those with a mental illness and substance misuse problems.  An area that has not received the attention it deserves is that of perinatal mental health.  Some of the funding secured for 2016 will be used to develop this important service.</p> <p> A Vision for Change is a progressive, evidence-based strategy.  When published in 2006, it provided a comprehensive framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the community and providing accessible, community-based or specialist services for people with a mental illness.  It was designed to have a ten-year lifespan, which means that next year will be its final year.  Discussions are under way within the Department of Health on the parameters of a review of the strategy.  Any new mental health policy should be broader in its scope than just mental illness and recognise the importance of health and well-being, positive mental health and resilience and the wider social influences in that regard.  It should also have regard to the evidence of national and international best practice.  I hope to be in a position to agree the parameters of a review in the coming weeks.  </p> <p> I assure the House that the Government remains fully committed to mental health and suicide prevention services and the continued development of modern and responsive services in line with A Vision for Change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1188" speakername="Colm Keaveney" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900037#KK00200"><p>One of the most gratifying developments in the past decade in challenging prejudice and stigma has been the improved attitudes in society towards mental health.  We should not be complacent, however, as there is much left to be done, but we should acknowledge the significant improvements we have seen in challenging stigma and delivering improved treatments.  Where people with mental health problems were once hidden away behind high walls, with other groups of stigmatised persons such as single mothers and their children, our society has now firmly and rightly rejected that approach in the context of the word "care".  We have, in the past 20 years, faced up to much of the darkness of our past, which included industrial schools, laundries and mother and baby homes.  When it came to some of those past abuses, the State was able to share the blame with other bodies such as the Catholic Church or it managed to disguise its own failures behind those of others.  However, in terms of the sheer numbers involved, the abuses perpetrated within the mental health system dwarfed everything else.  On the human rights abuses that occurred in the old asylums, the entire blame lies squarely and solely with the State.  That past has yet to be investigated and acknowledged and an apology has yet to be given to victims.  </p>  <p>  Among the factors that played a part in my choice to join Fianna F&aacute;il was the excellent work done by that party in government from 2000 onwards in improving mental health services and moving the approach to treatment away from an institutional model towards a recovery-based one.  The two key achievements of Fianna F&aacute;il during that time in mental health policy were implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 and the reforms set out in A Vision for Change which, as the Minister of State indicated, will be ten years old next year.  While both are now in need of review, they represented a significant change of mindset ain how we approached the issue of mental health.</p>  <p>  A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  It laid out a ten-year strategy for the reform of mental health services and signalled a new approach to the delivery of services to users.  Significant progress was made between 2006 and 2011 in advancing that vision and providing the investment required to ensure its success.  In 2011 Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised in their programme for Government to press on with the development of community mental health teams and ring-fence funding for that purpose.  They have failed to honour these commitments.  Not one cent of the &euro;35 million allocated for the development of community mental health teams in 2015 has been spent.  Vulnerable people in desperate need have been left to cope by themselves.  As well as being a complete neglect of duty, this situation places a massive strain on the families and friends of those most in need of help.  Only 24% of mental health posts approved last year were filled by 31 March this year.  Delays in hiring within the year where posts are promised have been a consistent feature under the Government.</p><p> For the Health Service Executive to claim the only reason there are enormous gaps in front-line mental health services is it has been unable to find suitable staff is inexcusable.  The notion that it has been actively seeking to recruit front-line staff within the timeframes of A Vision for Change does not ring true.  In reality, there has been a deliberate and sneaky slowdown in the recruitment of promised community mental health service staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s own 2014 national service plan outlined strategically plans to delay the recruitment of mental health service staff until the latter half of the year to save money.  The plan specifically stated certain recruitment initiatives, including the appointment of community mental health workers, would be &ldquo;specifically targeted towards the latter half of 2014 to allow ... savings to be utilised on specific services on a timing delayed basis".  That was a political and deliberate decision by the Government to ensure staff would not be recruited in this area.  As a result, the funding that had been ring-fenced for the recruitment of specialised community health teams under A Vision for Change remained unspent.  There are now 1,000 fewer filled mental health posts than when the Government took office in 2011, this at a time when the greatest public health crisis of our generation requires an investment focused on mental health.  The implications of failing to recruit the promised community health teams are grave.  We cannot continue to allow a situation to continue where someone in severe difficulty has nowhere to go.  The Minister of State needs to explain the failure with respect to the allocation in last year's budget, as 76% of promised front-line posts remained unfilled.  The Government has failed to deliver a functioning mental health service, despite prioritising other sectors.  Units such as St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Ballinasloe have been closed and not replaced with community mental health teams.  As a result, major backlogs are developing in the system.  The real aim of the closure of units such as St. Brigid&rsquo;s has more to do with cost savings achieved than with the development of community structures.  In the past two years there was a &euro;70 million underspend in the national mental health budget.  This money has been moved from the mental health sector to other parts of the health service for political and electoral reasons.</p> <p> There are many other serious issues within mental health services, but I want to highlight two as critical.  First, there is the continuing practice of placing children in adult wards.  This is an abuse of the rights of children and leaves us in contravention of our international commitments to human rights.  The other issue is the recent notable and significant increase in the incidence of electroconvulsive therapy being administered against the expressed and clear will of individuals.  This practice also needs to end.  It is welcome that the Minister of State has outlined that progress will be made in December in amending legislation to address this issue.</p> <p> Mental health issues continue to have a devastating impact on our society.  The Ireland we want to build must commit itself to an all-out effort to help people and reduce the number of cases of self-harm and suicide.  In doing this we can learn from initiatives that have already worked well.  Since the Road Safety Authority was established, it has helped to halve the number of deaths on the roads.  That means that the lives of more than 200 people a year have been saved.  It is time to do the same in the field of mental health.  </p> <p> Accordingly, Fianna F&aacute;il proposes the establishment of a national mental health authority to be charged with adopting an agency approach to lead the promotion of positive attitudes to mental health, while reducing the incidence of self-harm and suicide.  One key feature of this idea is challenging political interference with the mental health budget whereby it has been stolen, as I referred to.  The authority would provide for a definite ring-fenced approach to funding mental health services and prevent moneys from being pulled from mental health services to shore up other parts of the health service.  The establishment of the authority would mean that a vote of the D&aacute;il would be needed to alter the budget for the proposed mental health authority, ensuring full accountability.  The authority would be a separate body from the HSE, with its own director general.  It would remain under the authority of the Department of Health, working in co-operation with the HSE through a range of mutual service-level agreements.  I look forward to making the argument for the establishment of the authority in the forthcoming general election and ensuring mental health will feature as one of the key topics of debate in the context of our vision for the future for mental health services, as well as the continuing effort to reduce any remaining stigma with regard to it.  Stigma is a great stealer of innocent human lives.</p> <p> I acknowledge and welcome the commitment given by the Oireachtas to facilitate this debate on this important policy area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900038#LL00200"><p>According to the most recent statistics available for suicide in the State, 459 persons - 368 males and 91 females - took their own lives in 2014.  During the same period there were 62 undetermined deaths which in the North and other countries would be normally counted as suicides.  At the same time, around 300 citizens in the North die each year by suicide.  It is generally accepted that the real figure for suicides is higher and that as many as 1,000 citizens die across the island each year by suicide.</p>  <p>  The human cost for families and communities is devastating.  The reality is that all sections and generations of our society are affected, from the very young to the very old, in rural and urban areas alike.  Mental health is traditionally an area in which Ireland has performed badly.  While society has started to deal with the issue in a more open way, mental health remains a taboo subject for many and mental health care has been poorly provided for.  While there have been attempts to reconfigure health spending and ensure mental health care is prioritised, we see funds earmarked for mental health services spent in other areas.</p>  <p>  Preventive and early intervention mental health care remains underfunded.  One in seven adults in Ireland, 644,000 people, has experienced a mental health difficulty in the past year.  Despite a perceived openness about mental health, the number of suicides has remained high, with between 495 and 554 deaths per year between 2009 and 2012.  Lack of staff in the sector is a major problem.  Despite a greater need for mental health services, there are 1,200 fewer mental health staff now than there were in 2006.  A report in June 2015 highlighted an 11% decrease in posts since 2008, despite 1,200 being promised.  Between 2008 and 2015, there was a loss of over 1,000 mental health staff and staffing levels were only 77% of the recommended level in A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  The situation is more severe in child and adolescent mental health services, with just over half of the staff required in post.  There have been considerable staff losses in mental health nursing, with a reduction of 1,063 nurses between March 2009 and September 2014.  Around the clock mental health services for adults in acute mental distress are still lacking across considerable parts of the State.  The overall budget is insufficient also.</p><p>Nine years on from the publication of the strategy, just 6% of the total health budget goes to mental health services, compared to 7.2% in 2006 and far short of the 10% target.  In 2015 the figure is predicted to be only 6.5%.  In 2014 there was a &euro;15 million shortfall in funds due to be ring-fenced for community based mental health and suicide prevention services.  There were also delays in spending the &euro;35 million promised in budget 2013.  In fact, in practically every year of this D&aacute;il term the Government has not even spent the amount to which it has publicly committed.  <br/><br/>We need to see a modern bio-psycho-social model of care available locally across the disciplines, with a focus on primary care, counselling and 24/7 access to emergency supports.  We also need to address the issues of housing, employment and discrimination in line with proposals made by Mental Health Reform, on some of which I will touch.  The proposals contained in the overarching framework document for the sector, A Vision for Change, are sound, but they have never been fully introduced and so-called ring-fenced funding has, in some cases, not materialised. <i></i>A Vision for Change<i></i>was published in January 2006 and originally supposed to be reviewed after seven years, but that is only now occurring.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes A Vision for Change still needs to be implemented.  Additional funding should be provided and directed towards community mental health services.  <br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for suicide prevention, Connecting for Life, needs to be incorporated.  It sets a target to reduce the incidence of suicide and self-harm by 10% in the next five years, based on WHO targets.  A continuation of the roll-out of suicide crisis assessment nurses is needed.  These nurses liaise with GPs where there are concerns about patients who may be suicidal.  The data available for the impact these nurses have had to date are very encouraging.  However, only 24 of the 35 nurses approved for the programme have been recruited, which is unfortunate.  The full initial complement must be recruited and deployed as a matter of extreme urgency.<br/><br/>Greater support must also be extended to people with mental health issues to access housing.  Recent housing lists showed a need for just over 1,000 places for those with mental health difficulties.  There was a 36% increase in admissions of homeless people to psychiatric units between 2006 and 2013.  We need increased supports to access appropriate housing to aid integration and recovery. <br/><br/>In January 2015, 429 children were waiting more than one year to be seen by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS.  That figure has improved, as the Minister of State recorded, but we need to focus on early intervention.  There has been investment in child and adolescent mental health teams but just half of what was recommended in A Vision for Change and far from enough to meet the 50% increase in demand for the service.  By the end of 2014, there were 63 partially complete community CAMHS teams in place, but in A Vision for Change<i></i>77 teams were recommended. <br/><br/>On crisis supports, more than nine years after publication of A Vision for Change, mental health services are still not uniformly providing the basic model of care that includes 24/7 crisis intervention and home based and assertive outreach treatment, with crisis houses as the norm in all areas.  The HSE reports that in nine of 17 mental health areas there is weekend cover for existing mental health service users across the entire catchment area, while in the remaining eight areas they are partially in place.  A clear framework for collaboration and referral between mental health services is lacking.  This issue must be addressed. <br/><br/>People with mental health difficulties, like other forms of disability, disproportionately experience unemployment which can, in turn, exacerbate their health difficulties.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the expansion of Employment First supports, whereby a person&rsquo;s work preferences and skills are assessed quickly after coming into contact with mental health providers, a suitable placement in the workforce is identified and appropriate supports are offered within the work environment.  Mental Health Reform is leading a pilot project,<b></b>Integrated Employment and Mental Health Support, in which four EmployAbility companies are participating.  The Department of Health provided &euro;250,000 to allow each of the companies to employ an additional job coach for the two year period.  The pilot project is based on a British Individual Placement and Support, IPS, model of supported employment.  It espouses an employment first approach in which a person's vocational skills and work preferences are assessed quickly after coming into contact with mental health services.  Being job-ready is not a requirement; rather a suitable setting in the workforce is found and support is provided to develop skills within the work environment.  A report for the British Department of Work and Pensions found that for every &pound;1 invested in IPS, there was an expected saving to the Exchequer of &pound;1.51.<br/><br/>Primary care services should also play a central role in supporting those suffering from mental health difficulties.  Many find it very difficult to access help when needed, while some cannot afford to make use of private counsellors.  The Counselling in Primary Care, CIPC, service is an early intervention programme that provides medical card holders with mild to moderate mental health difficulties with access to a limited number of sessions.  It is imperative that this service capacity is increased in order that those on low wages who often find it very difficult to access such care are looked after appropriately.</p></speech>

I totally support the Children's Mental Health Coalition which consists of more than 50 organisations from a variety of backgrounds and sectors, including children's rights, human rights, education and mental health services.  I also warmly and strongly support the recommendations made in the coalition's report from 2013, Someone to Care, which identifies the experiences and mental health needs of children and young people in the care and youth justice systems.  I strongly support implementation of the national guidelines on mental health promotion for primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  What is the reality on the ground?  As of December 2014, the number of staff posts in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, was 499.5 whole-time equivalents.  This is just 41.7% of the staffing level recommended in A Vision for Change - 1,196 whole-time equivalents - and represents a 2.9% decrease in the number of staff in the CAMHS at the end of 2013.  According to the Minister's performance assurance report at the end of 2014, the waiting list for the CAMHS has increased to 2,818 cases, an 8% increase on the figure for the same period in the previous year.  A total of 405 children and adolescents, or 14%, have been on the waiting list for more than 12 months.  By the end December 2014, there had been 290 child and adolescent admissions, 31% of which were to approved adult mental health inpatient units.  </p>  <p>  Yesterday I visited a community education project in Donaghmede in my constituency.  The organisation which runs the project, Target, is excellent, but it is facing many difficulties.  The HSE pulled support from its special needs programme, thereby depriving the most vulnerable people of the opportunity to learn new skills which would give them confidence and enable them to live independently in their communities.  The real benefit for students was in integrating, over a cup of tea, and improving their social and communication skills.</p><p>However, the HSE no longer funds a manager or clinical director of its counselling service.  On the retirement of its manager, who was on secondment to Target by the HSE, the funds were directed towards a clinical director for a counselling service.  It had a clinical director two days a week but after two years the funding was cancelled.  We also had an excellent mediation service in Coolock through the Northside Community Law Centre.  This, too, is under fierce pressure.</p> <p> It is important to ensure voluntary organisations on the ground are supported.  What do we need to do?  We need to prioritise the full range of mental health services from primary to specialist mental health services.  CAMHS should provide mental health services to children and adolescents aged zero to 18 years of age.  Service users, carers and their families should be given the opportunities to influence developments within the mental health services based on their experiences.  Finally, mental health promotion and primary prevention should be targeted at child populations at risk.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the role of the Oireachtas group on mental health.  We are probably the only group who can agree a pre-budget submission.</p>  <p>  We know the old way was to medicate, institutionalise and use some horrific procedures.  I welcome what the Minister of State said on ECT earlier.  We should dedicate it to the memory of the late John McCarthy of Mad Pride Ireland and Pat Bracken, who did so much work in this area.</p>  <p>  We know the growing figures but I will mention two in particular.  The first is the number of young boys who are presenting as having self-harmed.  The other concerns Pavee Point.  Yesterday I attended a celebration of its 30 years in existence.  An increasing number of male Travellers are coming forward and telling of suicide ideation.</p>  <p>  Accident and emergency units are chaotic, busy and hectic.  Presenting with a mental health issue in an accident and emergency unit adds to the person's distress.  This applies, in particular, to people with autism and Asperger's syndrome as noise is so difficult for them.  We need to look at the possibility of having dedicated intellectual disability nurses in accident and emergency units, especially for those who present with mental health issues on their own.</p>  <p>  The priority across the board should be prevention and early intervention.  In particular, we should be working with young people.  It is parents, teachers or youth workers who will first see it when they present as suffering mental health difficulties.  Such difficulties in early life place young people at increased risk of further episodes during their adult lives.  The numbers of clinical staff in CAMHS have to get to the levels recommended in A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  Integration of services was mentioned by the Minister of State in her speech.  There is an issue around dual diagnosis of mental health issues and substance misuse.  The underlying issues are not being addressed because they are being treated separately.</p>  <p>  We know that it is people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most susceptible to mental health issues.  Family support is vital.  In the meantime, however, can the budgets be restored?  There were cuts of 30% and more to the addiction, community and youth projects working at the coal face with these young people.</p>  <p>  I cannot believe I will now defend smoking but there are plans for all HSE facilities to be smoke free.  There are facilities dealing with people who are in vulnerable situations and dealing with other addictions.  Smoking is the least of their difficulties.  I do not believe in a blanket ban.  I understand the rationale but I do not believe it to be the way forward.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned suicide prevention.  She visited the Oasis Centre and knows the work it is doing with vulnerable people.  She knows it has qualified counsellors and psychotherapists but minimal Government funding.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to be open to innovative programmes.  I met a midwife yesterday who works with women suffering from addiction who are pregnant.  She came across a lovely programme abroad.  It brings in women to cuddle babies who are born into addiction.  We need to be open to those types of innovations.</p></speech>

I spoke recently at a conference held by the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.  I spoke to youth mental health workers and psychiatrists beforehand.  One of them told me there is such low morale in the service that they are finding it impossible to hire people for youth mental health posts.  A psychiatrist told me that access to youth mental health services is currently so bad that GPs outside of Dublin are writing letters advising that the young person is at serious risk of suicide.  They are advising that young person to go to an emergency department in a Dublin hospital with the letter in order to skip the queue and get access to youth mental health services.  That is what is going on in our country but there is no recognition of how bad the situation is in mental health and youth mental health services.</p>  <p>  A Vision for Change recommended that 8.24% of the health budget should be spent on mental health services.  We are at 6%.  The UK is at 12%.  In the past seven years, we have lost more than 1,000 mental health staff.  This means that our staffing levels are less than 80% of what is recommended in A Vision for Change.  As well as adequate funding, the system needs to be seriously modernised.  The mental health integration index examines the progress of European countries in helping people manage their mental health to recovery.  It looked at areas such as the provision of a stable home and family environment, access to health services, the improvement of work and education opportunities, the reduction of stigma and the increasing of awareness.  Of the 30 countries surveyed, Ireland ranked in 14th place.  It ranked 16th on access and 17th on opportunities for those in need of mental health support.</p>  <p>  In youth mental health, the situation is critical.  Young people in Ireland are facing a suicide rate that is in the top four in Europe.  More than one fifth of young adults indicated that they have engaged in self-harm.  A study of LGBT young people found that one in five has attempted suicide.  One in four has self-harmed and one in three has thought seriously of ending his or her life in the past year alone.</p>  <p>  What is Ireland's response?  As of December last year, we had just more than half the staffing level for youth mental health services recommended in A Vision for Change.  There are many solutions.  We need to move urgently from a paediatric-adult model to a paediatric-youth-adult model.</p></speech>

Young people should not be entering the system via health centre waiting rooms but via suitable access that is stigma free.  We must remove the siloed access that only kicks in at critical stages for young people and move to early detection and a comprehensive suite of services.  We must move from a paternalistic approach to youth mental health and actively include young people in designing a system that is appropriate for them.</p></speech>

We come from a very low base, historically, in terms of our mental health services and how we have dealt with people who suffer from mental illness.  My mother was a psychiatric nurse in the 1940s.  The institution she worked in was known in her time as the mental hospital but 20 years before that it was known as the lunatic asylum.  We are coming from that low base which goes back decades and centuries.</p>  <p>  Even in recent decades we have neglected the opportunity to improve the area.  Things have moved on and when A Vision for Change was published there was an increased concentration on the issue and the opening up of debate.  Society had a greater awareness of the need to have a modern approach to dealing with mental health services.  I welcome the Minister of State's statement that there will be a nine or ten year review of A Vision for Change next year.  It will be interesting to see the analysis of its implementation.</p>  <p>  Child and adolescent mental health services and the 89 admissions to adult hospitals last year were already mentioned.</p><p>There is a difficulty with this situation.  In Limerick, for example, 20 beds were promised for the mid-west, but that was shelved some years ago.  Now, somebody in Limerick must go to Cork, Dublin or Galway and somebody in Donegal must go to Galway.  That creates a difficulty for parents in continuing to visit their families, which is very important for young people.</p> <p> I welcome the review of the 2001 Act.  This has been sought for some time so I welcome the fact that legislation will be brought forward in December.  The &euro;35 million allocation has been mentioned in previous discussions.  There is an issue with the rolling out of improvement in the mental health services following the commitment by the Government.  There is a full commitment of &euro;155 million to the development of mental health services - &euro;35 million each year, except for one year when the allocation was &euro;25 million.  There appeared to be no plan in place to respond to that.  It was part of the programme for Government so the HSE should have anticipated it, but it appears that the plans for recruitment commence on 1 January rather than having everything ready to go.  As a result the people are not recruited until the end of the year.  That is an issue we have raised over a number of years in respect of the roll-out of the improvement in the mental health services.</p> <p> Stigma has been mentioned.  It is a key issue in educating people with regard to understanding mental health services.  One in four people will suffer from a mental illness at some stage in their life.  Mental illness does not exclude anybody: anybody can suffer from a mental illness.  Stigma is a crucial issue in seeking assistance and in the demand for services by people in difficulty.  There is still a sense of hiding it, unlike with other illnesses, when there should be an opening up and a demand for the services.  I hope to deal with this in a letter.</p> <p> Another issue in mental health is the coverage of mental health by Voluntary Health Insurance, VHI, and other bodies.  There is discrimination in the coverage of mental health services.  The VHI covers 180 days for general health issues and hospitalisation while the psychiatric policies vary from 100 days to 180.  Likewise, GloHealth Insurance has no time limit on physical health whereas there is a time limit of 100 days for mental health services.  Laya Healthcare has coverage for hospitals of 180 days, but it is 100 days for psychiatric inpatients.  It is difficult to understand why there is discrimination in this area.</p> <p> We have heard the figures for suicide.  Suicide is a particular problem among young people.  The suicide rate for young people is particularly worrying.  The suicide rate among teenage girls in Ireland is the highest of any EU state, while the rate for young Irish males is the second highest.  Ireland has the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in Europe, that is, of people under 25 years of age.  While our suicide rate is generally just below the European average, our youth suicide rate is one of the highest in Europe.  That is of extreme concern.</p> <p> I welcome Connecting for Life, and I wish I had more time to discuss it.  The World Health Organisation warmly welcomed and praised its publication, content and objectives.  We have targets of 10%.  Reach Out had targets as well.  In fact, the Reach Out ten year programme from 2005 to 2015 recommended that there would be overall targets for the reduction of suicide rates, which should have been set by the then Government to advise the then Minister for Health and Children, when the Minister was satisfied that the suicide rates had been reasonably accurately determined.  However, that did not take place.  There was a strategy for action which was discussed and introduced in 2008 and 2009.  A reply to a recent parliamentary question I tabled informed me that in 2009 there was a strategy to reduce it by 10% from the 2005 figures.  However, when one analyses the figures one finds that the average for the five years up to 2005 was 494 while the average for the five years up to and including 2014 was 497.</p> <p> Did Reach Out attain any of its objectives?  The main objective was to reduce suicide rates and that did not happen.  We must ensure that when we set targets the programme that is applied will meet those targets.  The content and implementation of Reach Out did not reduce the suicide level, as the figures suggest.  We will be given all types of explanations for that situation, but they are not good enough.  Extensive resources were provided to achieve the objectives of Reach Out but the facts show that it did not happen.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to raise an issue which I have been raising for the past ten years.  I have encountered serious examples of this.  It relates to the regulation of psychotherapists and counselling.  I was given two serious examples recently by people who have suffered extreme difficulties with people who are not qualified and not members of professional associations.  After ten years of examining this issue since the Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed in 2005, I again urge the Minister that the regulation of counselling and psychotherapy is vital to ensure that people who access those services are dealing with competent people.  I have heard examples of absolute exploitation and abuse of people who accessed psychotherapy and counselling which did not have the expertise available, as well as the abuse of using psychotherapy and counselling to damage people rather than assist them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-19a.671" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900041#OO00200"><p>I welcome this debate and acknowledge that the Minister provided the time to have statements on mental health services.  It is timely.  I wish to put in context the conflict that exists with regard to the Government's commitment to, and funding of, this service.  The cut in the marginal rate of tax, for example, was lauded by many but one could argue that it has been wiped out by increases in car insurance and medical health insurance.  In doing that the Government further put off the potential to provide the type of funding that is required in this area.</p><p>It is also against the background of there being a 6% growth rate in the economy this year.  While that and the progress in regard to inward investment are to be welcomed, and while favourable exchange rates assist that process, society must acknowledge, as this House has heard umpteen times, there is a crisis in the provision of housing throughout the country, a crisis in regard to waiting lists and the provision of accident and emergency services in our hospitals, and a crisis in the funding of local authorities, which have been told to raise commercial rates and property taxes to meet the shortfall, while Irish Water is subvented with regard to its rates and subvented further through car tax revenue.  My point is that while that continues apace, the Government has to make priorities and has to decide where it will focus its energies and its funding to meet the demands placed on it.  In this area, it is quite disappointing that, while the programme for Government committed to an annual ring-fenced &euro;35 million in funding for community mental health services, this commitment was broken in 2014, with funding reduced to &euro;20 million.</p> <p> The whole area of mental health is one which has, in a sense, been radicalised in recent years, which we commend and welcome.  At this point, it is only right and proper to pay tribute to and commend the various NGOs in this area which work tirelessly and give great service to the State and to many of its inhabitants.  I particularly want to congratulate Jigsaw Offaly for its Pride of Place award last week, and I also pay tribute to the many other voluntary bodies which, as I said, work tirelessly in this area and help State services to provide the assistance that is needed by the many people affected by mental health issues.  I also want to acknowledge and commend the many people who have spoken out about their own issues in this area, in particular the many prominent figures in sport, business and so forth who have helped to alleviate the stigma that has historically been associated with illnesses in this field.</p> <p> While that continues apace, and it is a great and welcome turnaround in Irish society, I do not believe the Government is giving this issue the priority it deserves.  I acknowledge the effort and commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in this area, and I am sure she is fighting the good fight with regard to the services which she has responsibility for funding and assisting.  However, it would appear that drive, commitment and support does not feature highly enough in the Government's reckoning.  After coming into office in what were, as we acknowledge, difficult times, it made a commitment in the programme for Government to ring-fence a certain amount of funding to meet the demands placed on it by virtue of the A Vision for Change strategy.  As I said, it is very disappointing that this commitment has been lost.</p> <p> As one of many Members of the House who will be a candidate facing the electorate in the coming months, I feel obliged to say that we need to reaffirm our commitment to this area and we need to state categorically where we stand.  From the perspective of my political organisation, Fianna F&aacute;il will reform and restructure the National Office for Suicide Prevention as a distinct entity within the mental health authority, giving it a ring-fenced budget, performance targets and an independent employment system, with clear interdepartmental input at Government and Secretary General level.  We would want to enhance the size and role of the National Office for Suicide Prevention to undertake matters such as the development of a new national strategy and the creation of a national 24-hour helpline.  We would propose to increase the number of resource officers for suicide prevention, enhance their role and link them directly to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  We would want to implement a system of GP practice whereby the prescription of antidepressant medication has to be reviewed on a monthly basis until the GP is satisfied the medication is the best course of action.  We would want to establish out-of-hours emergency social worker teams across Ireland.</p> <p> To refer back to our own role within our constituencies when we meet people affected who wish to avail of services, the difficulties they and their families have in accessing those services is something we have to reiterate and put on the record.  For example, with regard to the backlog in the waiting list for psychologists, figures released to us earlier in the summer appear to show that 5,432 people were waiting more than three months for an appointment with a psychologist.  Those figures are just a glimpse into the unfortunate and dire situation that people using the mental health services are facing.  People have already been told by their GPs that they have been referred to a specialist for assessment.  What is worse is the fact that more than 1,000 people are forced to wait more than a year.</p> <p> On the issue of child mental health, it is very challenging for us all to meet the demands placed on the services and to acknowledge those children should be to the forefront of any policy.  The HSE figures released at the end of last year suggested there were more than 3,000 children and teenagers waiting to access mental health services in the community, and more than 400 of those were waiting over a year.  This has to be a great cause of concern and relates, more than likely, to the lack of staff, which contributes to rising waiting lists.  I know the HSE said it has had difficulty in recruiting staff, which I find unfortunate and amazing.  I would like to know from the Minister of State what progress has been made in recent times in order to address the supposed difficulty the HSE claims exists.  With regard to the community mental health teams for children and teenagers, it appears these have just 42% of the number of staff recommended in the Government's own mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, which represents a 3% drop-off in staff compared to the previous year.</p> <p> Those are some simple and obvious insights into the situation with regard to the provision of services throughout the country, and particularly in my constituency, given the national figures mentioned are evident in my community.  These are issues which I have an obligation to voice and share with the Minister of State in the hope that the Government can respond to this in a positive manner and reaffirm the commitment contained in the programme for Government and, more importantly, reaffirm the monetary commitment it made in order to give effect to all that was contained within A Vision for Change.  I expect there would be an audit of that in the short term and that the Government would make a statement on the goals set within it which have yet to be achieved, or which have not been funded.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the fact that this Government has ring-fenced &euro;125 million for mental health funding.  Mental health is a private illness with public consequences.  It is devastating when people's lives collapse around them.  In addition, mental illness does not discriminate and can affect anybody at any time; indeed, it can tear families apart.</p>  <p>  Given that I have a relatively short speaking time slot, I would like to focus my comments on some of the outstanding work on mental health that goes on in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Some months ago, I met with two local students, Thomas Ganley from Longford and Niamh Tubridy from County Westmeath.  Their goal is to promote positive mental health through the "Let's Go Mental" campaign.</p>  <p>  Thomas and Niamh are passionate about this project.  The campaign is a series of 31 regional events for teenagers to promote positive mental health.  One of these regional events took place in Longford town and it focused on the small, positive things we can do every day which make a big difference to how we feel.  It was a great event which was very well run.  All credit should go to Thomas, Niamh and the rest of the event's organisers.</p>  <p>  We already have an excellent Good2Talk centre in Mullingar.  The centre supports positive mental health by providing effective and accessible counselling services.  I have been informed by the Minister that negotiations are ongoing with a view to opening a Good2Talk centre in Longford.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that these negotiations reach a favourable conclusion as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2015, nine applied suicide intervention skills training workshops were delivered in Longford and Westmeath to a total of 220 individuals.  Meanwhile, 25 SafeTalk programmes were delivered to a total of 375 people.  Despite the financial pressures, &euro;21 million has been allocated to Longford and Westmeath in 2015 for mental health services.  While this is welcome, we must continue to rebuild and sustain our funding of mental health services, especially in the midlands where rural isolation is a real issue.</p>  <p>  I cannot speak in this debate on mental health without mentioning the exceptional work that takes place in St. Christopher's in Longford Town.  My mother, Marcella, was a founding member of the service and I have been attending the school's annual general meetings for decades.  St. Christopher's runs a great service and provides many programmes to equip service users with personal, social and work-related skills that will enable them to progress to greater levels of independence.  In 2014, I ensured the financial stability of the services by lobbying the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the HSE to cover cash-flow issues encountered by St. Christopher's, which started back in 2008, long before the current Government took office.  However, the National Council for Special Education recently informed the school of a reduction in two special needs assistant posts.  This news is a big worry for staff, pupils and families who are dependent on those services.</p>  <p>  One of the aims of St. Christopher's school is to enable children to become as independent as possible.  The loss of two staff members will have a detrimental effect on pupils' well-being, education and independence.  In addition, pupils' access to the curriculum will be restricted, as the school will not have staff available to enable full participation.  I have already raised this serious issue with the Minister, but I want to take this opportunity to put it on the record that we must do all we can to ensure both of these SNAs are reinstated as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  Mental health promotion remains the most undeveloped area of health promotion in Ireland.  The need for positive mental health promotion is universal and relevant to all of us, so we need to ensure it is adequately funded.  I thank the Minister of State for attending the House for this important debate.  Mental health issues have affected communities around the country, while over the years every parish has been afflicted by suicides.  We must therefore strive to ensure that sufficient funding is in place to upgrade mental health services in every single part of the country, but particularly in rural areas where isolation is prevalent.</p></speech>

For too many years there has been a stigma attached to mental health, which portrayed mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and a taboo subject within society in general.  Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness but is in fact a level of mental well-being which equips us to deal adequately with the day-to-day challenges of life while achieving our potential in a professional and personal capacity.  This means it is something which affects all of us.</p>  <p>  Mental illness in this country is still a widespread problem with high levels of depression and other illnesses across our communities.  The number of people living with mental illness has risen sharply over the past few years.  This is partly due to the impact of extreme stress and hardship which people experienced during the height of austerity, but it is also because more people are coming forward to seek help.</p>  <p>  This new willingness to seek help is a direct result of the increased public discourse on mental health and public awareness initiatives.  A huge amount of credit must also go to campaigners who have shared their stories of survival and perseverance.  There is no doubt that the intervention of such people and their very human stories have inspired people to speak out and have in the process saved lives.</p>  <p>  The phrase which has been popularised in recent years, that "It is okay to not be okay&rdquo;, sums up well the drive for people to feel comfortable to seek help and for others to support their friends and families.  These types of conversations should be actively supported.</p>  <p>  A lot of progress has been made in how we as a society treat mental health and illness, but the number of people who take their lives each year shows that we have a long way to go.  We can also see that a high number of people engage in self-harm or para-suicidal behaviour but we must remember that mental illness is not just about suicide or self-harm.  Many people who suffer with depression, anxiety or psychosis may never seek to end their lives, nevertheless, their illness is debilitating and limits their potential for happiness and success in life.</p>  <p>  As with our medical system, our approach to mental health must not be solely about treating emergency situations but also about guarding against them and improving society as a whole.  In Ireland today, it is estimated that one in five individuals suffers with mental health issues in one form or another.  I would speculate that the actual figure is higher.  This is because of a stigma still being attached, whether it be with young men and their perceptions of masculinity, or with older generations due to the position held by the Catholic Church for many years.</p>  <p>  According to the latest figures available, there is evidence that suicide and mental illness are not specific to a particular demographic but are applicable to all walks of society.  We all know of someone who has been a victim of mental illness and the effect that such deaths have on those closest to them.  These deaths are undeniably tragic, but are also preventable if the commitments the Government has made were to be followed up on.</p>  <p>  We have to ask a number of questions.  Do we have the right strategy and, if so, is it realistic and properly funded?  Workers within the sector have consistently highlighted how resources and funding made available to them annually are nowhere near enough to enable them to provide an efficient service based on a proactive approach, rather than a reactive one.  Anecdotally, I am told by some mental health professionals that they have noted a stark increase in demand for their services in recent times, thus putting more pressure on their resources. </p><p> Mental health services have been historically underfunded in this State to a shameful degree.  We are very lucky to have so many excellent charitable and voluntary bodies which have championed those who are struggling with or overcoming mental health issues.  For far too long, they have filled the gaps that have been left by a failure of the State to address mental health with the seriousness and focus it deserves.  These services rely greatly on donations and fund raising.  They are often severely over-stretched and they should not be used to absolve the Government of its responsibility in the provision of mental health services, allowing it to distance itself from these services at a time when substantial additional funding is greatly required.  One group, SOSAD, deals with between 450 to 500 people on a weekly basis and almost its entire budget goes on providing these vital services.  It is stretched to the last cent of its funding and this limits the ability to provide training to its volunteers.  It also puts major strain on the people involved and their morale.</p> <p> This is about the expense incurred by a young person and the substantial costs of services.  The issue of cost is something that alienates people from availing of these services and may be the difference between people getting the help they need or not getting it.  Unfortunately, we all are too aware of the consequences of people being unable to access these services.  Rural Ireland has once again disproportionately suffered in this regard with most services based in urban areas.  Limited transport to these centres may mean travelling up to 20 or 30 miles for some people and could result in a large portion of their time being taken up.  The lack of basic services must be addressed if we are to reduce suicide and mental illness figures in any significant way.</p> <p> The predicted funding of 6.5% of the overall health budget does not go far enough in the provision of mental health services and is still a long way off the 10% recommended.  Last year alone, there were 459 deaths that were known suicides.  This is one and a quarter deaths per day.  How many of these may have been preventable if more proactive and accessible services were in place?  One of the major problems is our after-hours services and weekend services, which are practically non-existent.  We need a 24-7 service with psychiatrists on hand in accident and emergency departments.  The Government promised this but it does not seem to have been delivered.  A recent case of mine involved a person who was turned away by an ordinary doctor.  There was no psychiatrist available.  This led to serious consequences.  There is a shortage of nurses and the number of those leaving or retiring from the services is disproportionately higher in mental health services compared to other hospital services.  People are being turned away from accident and emergency departments and are not being diagnosed properly.  It is high time that we really began to regard this issue as one of paramount importance.  Since 2011 alone, we have lost over 2,000 of our citizens to suicide.  Many of these were young people whose lives were taken far too soon - lives with so much potential that will never be fulfilled. </p> <p> In A Vision for Change, the Government promised to keep people in their communities.  A total of 40 people met regularly at the Tus Nua facility in Ballymun.  It was going very well.  The people were interacting and working with each other on a regular basis.  They are now being dispersed across the service in the different areas around Ballymun leaving us with no proper service in Ballymun.  This goes against the philosophy of A Vision for Change.  I would also like to mention Finglas Suicide Network, Pieta House and all the volunteers who have worked so hard to help people over the years.  They have helped people significantly.  The Tree of Hope, which the Minister of State may have heard of, is an organisation that is highlighting suicide.  It operates across the country and has spread to Europe where it plants trees for those who died through suicide.  People come along and put names on the trees.  Those trees have been left in parks the length and breadth of the country and the organisation is now moving into Europe.  It was begun by a woman in Tallaght and keeps awareness high.  Even young people who come to the parks, some of which have been vandalised, do not touch these trees.  The trees are a reminder that some of their friends have been lost through suicide.  Initiatives like that have been proven to help in the fight to get services and make people aware of this major problem that affects practically every family the length and breadth of this country.</p></speech>

I was the inaugural chairperson of Bailieborough Mental Health Association for a number of years in the mid-1990s.  That association went from strength to strength and became involved in a wonderful amount of wide-ranging activities.  I worked with the development officer of Mental Health Ireland in respect of the association's work for a number of years and I am happy to say that this association still exists and remains very strong.  One of its former volunteers, Sean McKiernan, became a regional development officer in Mental Health Ireland and did an exquisite job in that area.  I am very proud of that record of volunteerism so I like to think it gives me certain credentials to speak in this debate.  Regardless of my credentials, I certainly have a passion for this area.  I am very proud of Bailieborough Mental Health Association but I am equally proud of Bailieborough Mental Health Centre, which was one of the first community mental health centres in the country and continues to do an excellent job.  It is a great hub and social centre in the town.</p><p>I am also proud of the Cavan-Monaghan Mental Health Service, which has been very <i>avant-garde</i>, progressive and far-reaching.  After the fall of the Iron Curtain when eastern Europe was getting rid of some its atrocious institutions, which were worse that the worst Irish institutions, they sent their administrative and professional personnel over to look specifically at services in Cavan and Monaghan as a model for the development of modern services in their countries.</p><p>I am very proud of the input of Alan O'Mara at national level.  He is a Cavan football star and a native of Bailieborough who has talked about his own mental health issues on national television and radio and talked to young people at many events around the country.  It has had a huge effect.  He is a very important role model for our young people, as is another Cavan man from the Ballyjamesduff area, Jamie McGrath, who has recently written a book on anxiety.  This has also been very reassuring and pioneering work.  Mr. McGrath is also an important role model for young people.  These are the real leaders young people need.  They have created great awareness.</p><p>Cavan County Council held a debate in the past couple of weeks on this issue.  It is great to see this at local authority level.  Needless to say, a cross-party consensus emerged about the importance of suicide awareness.  Training in suicide awareness will be provided for members of Cavan County Council and front-of-house staff.  This is very progressive.  I am proud of those things and proud to come from that kind of background.</p><p>The traditional neighbourliness, meitheal and camaraderie that existed historically in rural and urban communities in Ireland was possibly born out of poverty or a time when the non-nuclear or extended family was far more focused than it is nowadays.</p><p>That old neighbourliness was a great assistance to good mental health, maybe unwittingly, and we must try to re-establish it.</p> <p> I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Nobody could doubt her credentials as a very passionate and professional Minister of State in this area.  Anyone who listens to her knows what a feel for the subject she has.  A former Minister of State, John Moloney, was also very passionate and did a very good job in this area.  It is great to have political leadership like that.  I am happy the Minister of State confirmed that &euro;125 million was ring-fenced by this Government in the worst of times.  That is a real commitment to A Vision for Change.  Of course it is not enough and I could write the speeches for those who would decry it as not being enough but it was very significant funding and an earnest of good intent which produced results.  I am heartened that the Minister of State has committed to ring-fencing &euro;35 million in the coming year.  She says there have been 1,150 new posts since 2012 and the community mental health teams have been augmented satisfactorily.  Therein lies the secret to minimising institutionalisation.  Tragically, there are times when that is unavoidable but it is the last option.</p> <p> I am delighted that the Minister of State is committed to making sure that the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, is supported.  I am a teacher and parent of three boys, and have many friends in the teaching profession and know parents, all of whom rate the CAMHS service highly.  It is important that there would not be waiting lists for CAMHS but that people are seen and dealt with immediately.  A waiting list is not good at any age but is particularly dangerous for children and teenagers.  The Minister of State does not need a lecture from me on that.  It is very important to have enough personnel in CAMHS that there are no waiting lists and that the community mental health teams do not suffer any lack of resources or people.  As increasing resources become available, when there is great optimism around Exchequer returns for 2016 to 2018, it has to be the mark of a civilised, advanced and progressive society that it gives a significant share of resources to, and positively discriminates in favour of, good mental health services.  I hope that when she sums up this debate the Minister of State will recommit herself to making sure there are no waiting lists for CAMHS, that the community health teams will be well resourced and ready to go and that in future there will be an increase on next year&rsquo;s &euro;35 million, especially at a time when independent economists are optimistic about Exchequer returns.</p> <p> As the Minister of State often says, it is not all about money.  That is far from being the only problem in respect of mental health.  The big issue is attitude and our willingness to support each other and to destigmatise it.  In my lifetime there has been huge destigmatisation and improvement.  There is a long way to go, we are not there yet but there is a huge improvement in the attitudes to mental health that were prevalent many years ago.  That is changing but there is a need for further change.  The biggest challenge for us as legislators is to contribute to that change.  We need the help of people like Jamie McGrath and Alan O&rsquo;Meara and various sportspeople, who are role models for young people and will speak out of their own experience.</p> <p> This is an important debate.  The Minister of State is passionate and has been doing an excellent job.  I ask her to make sure there are no waiting lists for CAMHS and to make sure we augment the community health teams.  We have to continue to work for destigmatisation.  That is our biggest challenge and we have a collective role in that.</p></speech>

In my area there were several clusters of young people who lost their lives through suicide.  One parent came to me, and probably to every other public representative in the area, because she was looking for it not to happen to anyone else, if that was possible.  She was still very raw.  She had gone through the strategy documents and referred particularly to Connecting for Life.  I had erroneously thought that the group most at risk of suicide were middle-aged men but she showed me the graph on page 3 of the document which showed the level of suicide among 15 to 19 year olds.  We are very much out of kilter with many of our European counterparts.  Greece and Spain are the two lowest on that scale which shows that disadvantage is not the reason for suicide.</p>  <p>  This parent pointed to a section on page 116 of the document which refers to &ldquo;SPHE, CSPE and PE, in Junior Cycle&rdquo;.  At senior cycle, however, the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is used.  That is the area that worries her because she said there is no in-service or specific teacher training for teachers who may be engaged with young people when something could be done.  She thinks this should be mandatory rather than encouraged.  She noted that the HSE has been at pains to point out how teen pregnancies have been reducing because of interventions.  This is something, she said, that is at least as serious if not more so but there is no mandatory provision or discussion at that level.  Her point was that we avoid talking about it.  This is a cohort of people who have neither the emotional maturity nor the language to talk about it.  Unless we provide it in a space where we are not dealing with a crisis we will not be intervening in a meaningful way.  I heard this from somebody who had spent day and night thinking about this for many months before she spoke with me. </p><p>She is seeking to identify a contribution she can make in order to help her understand what happened and to address the problem itself at the same time.</p> <p> In terms of voluntary and involuntary admissions, I would like the admissions policy to be specified when people present at accident and emergency departments because that has given rise to difficulties in a number of instances about which I will speak to the Minister separately.</p></speech>

One of the positive developments in society as a whole in recent years has been an increase in discussion and openness about people's mental health difficulties.  We are a long way from the stigma relating to mental health being fully removed but important progress has been made.  The reality is that having mental health difficulties is entirely normal.  One in four members of the population will experience a mental health difficulty at some stage and close to 50% of people in Ireland have had direct experience themselves or with friends and family.</p>  <p>  When it comes to assessing the role of the Government in developments in mental health, the score card is much more negative.  The reality is that austerity has been devastating in terms of mental health.  Living with unemployment, low income and precarious housing is extremely damaging to people's mental health, and it is seen in the tragic rise in suicides.  The figures from the National Suicide Research Foundation are shocking.  By the end of 2012, the rate of male suicide was 57% higher than it might have been had the economic recession not happened.  It stated that there were 476 additional male suicides on top of what "would have been expected" as a result of the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  Unfortunately, the rate of death by suicide is twice as high for those who are unemployed than for those who are at work.  </p>  <p>  The impact of austerity is giving rise to mental health difficulties.  We had the cuts in funding imposed under the previous Government, and continued by this Government, with the result that spending fell from approximately 13% to approximately 6% of the total health budget.  We have a promise now that will improve but the reality is that it is still entirely inadequate in terms of what we need.  Mental health services were among the hardest hit, with the recruitment ban representing a 10% loss in staffing levels despite the fact that the Minister's A Vision for Change estimates that we need 1,800 new staff.  The comparisons with other European countries are devastating in terms of the levels of spending as a percentage of total health spending.</p></speech>

The response of the HSE in respect of this matter has been extremely disappointing  L'Arche Kilkenny was obliged to carry out significant works to the tune of approximately &euro;300,000 to satisfy HIQA and to meet the standards now required - to FETAC level 5 - of the individuals it employs.  It was happy to do all of that but in its negotiations with the HSE, the matter has been put on the long finger.  This negotiation has been ongoing since July and moneys were to be paid to L'Arche to ensure that both its expenses and the debt incurred would be covered up to the end of 2015.  Thereafter, an increased level of funding will be required by the organisation.</p>  <p>  In Kilkenny, L'Arche is running at a deficit of &euro;18,000 a month and it is extremely concerned that it may have to close its service.  One family with which I have dealt directly were obliged to try to negotiate with regard to care for their loved one but, again, they were disappointed by the response from the HSE.  Those to whom I refer are advocating for family members, some of whom, presumably, are of the same age as the person being cared for; they might be brothers or sisters.  Why put those families through the stress and difficulties they are now experiencing?  The parents and others involved came together to hold a public meeting and issued a statement to the local newspapers expressing their disappointment with the response from the HSE.  In the covering letter sent to me they state that they have no faith in the HSE to deliver the funding which has been half promised for so long.  They are angry and upset that some of their elderly parents are being put through this worry and upset at this time of their lives.  They say that for some residents it is a brother or sister that takes on the role of advocate, and they want it to be known that they will not sit idly by.  Why do they have to fight like this?  Why is the service not recognised by the Department?  The funding, which has been half committed, should be given to L'Arche in a spirit of good faith and partnership so that it can continue, without worry, to the end of 2015.  It should be given an early indication of the increase it will receive in the context of its funding for 2016.  It is extremely unfair to the individuals to whom I refer and to the organisation in question.</p>  <p>  Something similar is happening in regard to respite at St. Patrick's special school.  Funding is available but the allocation of it has been parked while the delivery of a service is being examined.  While the allocation of such funding is being parked, parents are obliged to deal with this issue.  They are stressed out and at the end of the their tether.  Why would we not ensure that professionals are put in place speedily and this respite is given?</p>  <p>  In the same vein, T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g in Carlow provides respite services for children with special needs.  It is seeking &euro;320,000 from the HSE to provide, in co-operation with a local developer, the services that are necessary in Carlow.  This organisation has also been stonewalled by the HSE in meeting after meeting.  It has received no actual response from the executive on the delivery of the funding that is necessary to continue and expand the services or, in its case, to ensure it is given the appropriate capital fund.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Estimates are being released today.  Surely there is sufficient funding within the latter to give commitments to the end of 2015 and that thereafter - because the Minister of State knows its case - the necessary funding can be put in place without an argument.  This would mean that all the stress and trauma that goes with all engaging in public action and activity in respect of the shortfall in funding for those being cared for would be done away with.  If my suggestion were followed, each entity to which I have referred would know what it is going to receive and that would allow it to plan accordingly.</p></speech>

The HSE is acutely aware of the resource shortfall presented by Camphill and is currently engaging with it to develop a set of proposals to resolve the challenges over an agreed period of time.  This includes a commitment to supporting the organisation to reconfigure the current model of service and funding arrangements to a more sustainable model, while still maintaining the particular ethos of the service.  I believe the ethos in this case is very important.</p>  <p>  The HSE recognises the volunteer nature of the service model in Camphill.  Over the recent years of austerity where funding reductions were necessary, the HSE kept the reductions in funding to Camphill to a minimum, as with other similar volunteer-type services.  It is my understanding that the current challenges facing Camphill have arisen in the context of implementation of the national standards for residential care introduced in late 2013 which are regulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I am aware that some of the 17 Camphill communities have experienced particular challenges in achieving compliance and that others have progressed well.  The HSE will continue to collaborate with HIQA and the Camphill communities to achieve full compliance in all centres over the coming years as resources become available.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also aware of the financial challenges facing L&rsquo;Arche services in Callan, County Kilkenny, at this time and have been in ongoing contact with the management of L&rsquo;Arche over recent weeks and months in an effort to find a solution to these difficulties.  I am aware that these difficulties stem from compliance issues with the regulatory environment, which require that the model of service previously provided by L&rsquo;Arche be reviewed and enhanced.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been working with all voluntary service providers on improving compliance during 2015, addressing the areas of highest risk as a priority.  These efforts will continue in 2016 and preparation of the HSE&rsquo;s service and operational plans will be underpinned by a focus on making the best use of the resource invested in disability services.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the HSE remains committed to working with the Camphill and L&rsquo;Arche organisations, and to be as supportive as possible within current financial constraints.  I also assure service users and their families that the HSE will concentrate all its efforts on the continued provision of services in the local community and that work is ongoing with those affected to resolve the current difficulties.</p></speech>

Her response merely describes what the issue is and does not in any way attempt to answer the question I put on behalf of the parents of those using the service.</p>  <p>  The HSE gave a commitment and figures for funding have been discussed.  In her answer the Minister of State has refused to even deal with it.  The only point she made with confidence is that somebody is bending her ear.  I can tell her that the ears of the HSE have been bent and yet it has not responded in the way that I would expect.  It is dealing with the vulnerable and those who are in need of the service.  They need a commitment from the HSE to tell them that they will have the money before the end of the year and to tell them that the money they require for next year will be there for them.  Can the Minister of State not address that question and at least tell them so that they can take the anxiety out of their lives?  It would also take the anxiety out of the lives of those who volunteer to help and contribute to Camphill, L'Arche, T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g, and all the others who are trying to ensure they get the best for the clients they have.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable.  I cannot find words to describe it.  It is an avoidance of the issue and failing to addressing what is a real concern for parents.  The Minister of State could have used the opportunity to announce that it was at an advanced stage and tell them when they will get the money.</p></speech>

She may not have come across the detail of it at that time.  I was unable to await her response owing to the clash with Second Stage debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill dealing with risk equalisation in health insurance.</p>  <p>  The story of this long-awaited home for people with physical and sensory disabilities, two of whom and their families are known to me personally, has become a saga - I do not use that language lightly - of institutional incompetence.  It demonstrates all too clearly the silo attitude across our public services, in this instance the almost complete inability of the key players to sit down together and rationally address and overcome the questions and difficulties that can arise in a cross-services project.</p>  <p>  In this instance the players are the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Monaghan County Council and the Respond Housing Association.  I have seen so much correspondence over the years with one claiming the other has to do something or that another letter is due.  It is unreal.  Somewhere in there people are failing in their duty to assist this project move forward with appropriate speed and they are most certainly failing special and deserving people, and their families.</p>  <p>  In Margaret Hughes's case, when I first Margaret with her mother, Philomena, living in sheltered housing in my home town, Philomena's dearest wish was that she would see her daughter safely provided for within her lifetime.  Philomena is dead and gone and Margaret has not been provided for, as she should be.  She is in a placement, but it is not the appropriate placement despite what some might suggest.  In Romy Ward's case, her parents are also moving on in terms of age, and Briain and Sheila are hugely concerned for Romy's future.  There was a promised placement in this new group home facility, which has yet to see a single sod turned after all these years.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State if she will personally intervene in the outrageously delayed commencement of the long promised group home in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; that she would ensure that the serious disconnect between all the relevant entities, those I have named, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Monaghan County Council and Respond Housing Association is finally addressed and that the appropriate body from among their number, whoever that might be, would instruct the contractor to commence works immediately; and that she will assure the long waiting and long agonising intended occupants and their families of the earliest completion date possible.</p></speech>

I will read the informed and official response but, equally, I will have someone find out exactly how we can progress the issue as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  In the first instance I wish to inform the House that the matters raised in relation to the commissioning and commencement of the group home in Carrickmacross fall under the statutory remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the housing authorities.  I have been informed that in April 2013 the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the housing authorities approved capital assistance scheme funding of &euro;900,000 for the provision of a group home for people with physical and sensory disabilities at Drummond Otra, Convent Lands, Carrickmacross.  I understand from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that, following receipt of a tender report showing a 50% increase in the cost of the project, it requested a value-for-money appraisal of the project.  That is to be expected.  Anyone of us seeing such an increase would baulk at it.  As a result of this appraisal, a revised design was subsequently developed by the approved housing body and Monaghan County Council.  In addition, it was necessary for Monaghan County Council, in advance of committing significant amounts of Exchequer funding to the scheme, to engage with the HSE and HIQA in relation to design issues, ensuring that the units will be fully occupied once completed and that the ongoing services required to meet the needs of the individuals using the facility are in place before going forward.  We must ensure that as people age the group home is still sufficient for their requirements.  I have been informed that these steps are now being finalised by Monaghan County Council and that a decision on funding will be provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to Monaghan County Council shortly.</p>  <p>  As part of a joined up interagency approach to delivering housing to people with a disability I am informed that the HSE disability services manager for Cavan and Monaghan will continue to work closely with officials from Monaghan County Council and Respond Housing Association in progressing proposals for the development of this facility.  I hope we are at a point where, with a little bit of a push, we can bring the project over the line as quickly as possible.  I agree that it has taken far too long.</p></speech>

It is the second time we have had the opportunity to address this matter in this House today.  I note in the closing sentence of the opening remark the reference to, "As part of a joined-up interagency approach".  I am sure the Minister of State will have had experiences similar to mine in this regard, that the thinking is not always as joined up as it must be.  This is a major difficulty.  It is not a reflection on the current Government or any previous Government in particular but I have often heard and seen examples of the failure of various Departments to even join up in terms of respective projects.  In this case we have a multiple of different agencies and the project has not proceeded as it should.</p>  <p>  In terms of the issue in relation to the increased cost of the project, one can understand that an inordinate increase required examination but it is a couple of years even since that point and we have still not reached the get-go to get on with the project.  That is what is needed.</p>  <p>  While I recognise that the response, like others delivered by the Minister of State, is not of her own hand, nevertheless I take comfort from what she said to me personally in this exchange that she will explore where things are at currently and endeavour to release the logjam to allow this project to proceed.  It is absolutely essential that it would happen and it is vital for the cohort of young women who are coping in life with major physical and sensory disabilities that they are appropriately placed.  I respectfully ask that the Minister of State would come back to me at the earliest opportunity with whatever report she can share.</p></speech>

She will also be aware of the procedure of the early intervention team and its vital role in ensuring a child is properly assessed.  An early intervention team consists of a public health nurse, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, a social worker, a dietician and a child psychologist.  For a child to be assessed, he or she must meet each of those individuals who will compile their own reports and they will be used as the basis to determine what supports the child may need in primary school.  The supports can range from the provision of a special needs assistant, SNA, to helping a child progress with his or her speech development.  It usually takes about six months for the report to be progressed through the HSE and the requirements are put in place before the child starts school.</p>  <p>  However in Longford, the child psychologist is currently on maternity leave and has not been temporarily replaced.  That essentially means the psychological report cannot be produced and therefore the final report to the HSE cannot be completed.  As a result, we have a number of children in County Longford whose assessment is essentially at a standstill because the HSE has failed to provide cover while the child psychologist is on leave.  That presents a number of serious problems.  If parents wish to take the private route, they can pay to have their child privately assessed.  However, the HSE will not accept a report from the private sector.  There are strict instructions that the report must be compiled by a HSE-employed child psychologist.  Therefore, even if a parent is willing to pay &euro;300 to have a private report conducted, it will still not suffice.  In that case, all the parents can do is provide the report to the school, which will know exactly what the child requires but it is unable to apply for HSE-assisted funding because the report was not conducted by a HSE psychologist.</p>  <p>  Another problem is that when the child psychologist returns from leave, he or she will have a serious backlog of children that must be assessed and that will take a number of months.  Many of the children will already have been waiting a substantial period.  I wish to stress that this is in no way the fault of the early intervention team.  Any one member of the team may have to go on maternity leave, sick leave or compassionate leave.  The problem is simply due to a lack of arrangements on the part of the HSE to employ a temporary replacement while the current team member is on leave.  Therefore, we have a number of children in Longford who are essentially in limbo.</p><p>By the time they enter primary school in September 2016, their needs will not have been catered for properly and I plead with the Minister of State to intervene to cater for them.</p></speech>

It is widely accepted that the Government has prioritised development of all aspects of mental health policy and services.  Despite severe financial pressures overall, it has provided significant additional funding of &euro;125 million since 2012 to enable the Health Service Executive, HSE, to implement the long-overdue modernisation of mental health services in line with the strategy outlined in A Vision for Change.  In addition, I recently secured a further &euro;35 million to enhance mental health services in 2016.  Key to modernising services, in line with current and future demand and best international practice, is reorientation from a clinical focus to developing enhanced community-based provision.  Approximately 1,150 new posts have been approved for mental health services since 2012, of which approximately 280 have been allocated specifically to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, the bulk of which are now in place.  However, as in other areas in the health sector, the HSE is experiencing difficulty in recruiting and retaining key staff.  Adequate funding for mental health services is not the issue.  The HSE mental health division supports timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children and adolescents from a preventive care and early intervention perspective.  Primary care services are usually the first point of contact for children and adolescents when mental health problems initially present.  Primary care refers to health care delivered in local communities by psychologists, general practitioners, GPs, public health nurses, social workers and others in non-specialist settings.  Young people's first port of professional support, therefore, will be the primary care system, directly via their GP or other health service professionals.</p><p>It is my understanding that there are two whole-time psychologists covering the five County Longford primary care teams and that there are no vacancies on the primary care side in this regard.  Community child and adolescent mental health teams are the first line of specialist services for those 17 years or under who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  In County Longford there are two psychologists <i>in situ</i>, with no vacancies.  However, two additional psychologist posts are being sought by the executive in this area.  There are, I understand, two psychologist vacancies in the early intervention and mental health-intellectual disability areas.  The former is temporary in nature due to maternity leave, while the latter is a senior clinical psychologist position.  The HSE has sought to fill both posts through its national recruitment service, with no success thus far.  Some cover is provided in both areas for cases deemed to be urgent.  The HSE mental health division is acutely aware of the need to focus on recruitment of front-line staff in the CAMHS and is working closely with the human resources function and the national recruitment service, as well as carrying out international recruitment campaigns to attract candidates to particular specialties or parts of the country.  Despite these challenges, the latest figures from the HSE indicate a reduction in the category of those awaiting a CAMHS service for more than 12 months from 479 in March to 214 at the end of September, that is, a decrease of 55%.  The number of cases waiting more than three months to be seen has also decreased over the same period.  The issue raised by the Deputy will be pursued by the executive in that context.  While progress is being made, unfortunately, difficulties are still being experienced, more so in some parts of the country than in others and more so in some specialties than others.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of parents who, essentially, are banging their heads against a brick wall because the assessments of their children have simply been placed on hold for the duration of the period of leave.  The Minister of State's reply contains information which is contrary to what I have been given.  Once the leave is complete, a child will be placed in a backlog queue and all the while expected to navigate his or her first year or two in primary school without the professional support he or she desperately requires.  As the Minister of State is aware, this pertains to children who are just about to start primary school and need a little additional help in certain areas of their development but, essentially, they are being told that while the State is sorry, their assessment is on hold because the HSE is not providing cover.  Tht is the case in County Longford.  It is not acceptable and this issue should be taken seriously, although I have no doubt that it will by the Minister of State and the Department of Health.  These children should not be obliged to wait in limbo for almost 12 months until their assessments are approved officially by the HSE.  I plead with the Minister of State to intervene as soon as possible on behalf of the children of County Longford.</p></speech>

On the issue of maternity leave, as a woman, I have a particular interest in it, but it is quite difficult to get people to act as a replacement on a short-term basis.  People are seeking longer term contracts and unless this is exactly what one does all the time, people really do not wish to act as short-term replacements, which is understandable.  In some areas a team of people have been put in place to clear backlogs and if the position becomes acute in County Longford, I will consider this option also.</p></speech>

In recent years there have been unsustainable activities on the part of supertrawlers, the activities of which, in many people's eyes, have been unsustainable in an Irish, a European Union and a global context.  Today, four large supertrawlers are operating off the coast of County Donegal.  The<i>Margiris</i>and the<i>Annelies Ilena</i>are the largest and second largest, respectively, and have been fishing on and off for the past few years, while the other two are the <i>Jan Maria</i>and the<i>Maartje Theadora</i>.  It has been stated two fifths of European stocks, where data are available, were considered to be overfished, while a further 45% of stocks were estimated to be in a similar state.  This places huge pressure on small fishermen off the west coast.  I note the careful rebuilding of stocks in the Celtic Sea under the stewardship of the Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee, where, according to a 2012 report, stocks have recovered well and the fishery operation was regarded as being at a sustainable level.  Credit is due to the Minister and everyone involved as all stakeholders came on board to ensure the recovery of that fishery.</p><p>Recent surveys, however, highlight a concern about the current position.  These factory ships were run out of the waters off the west coast of Africa and the coast of Mauritius.  The<i>Annelies Ilena</i>, previously the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i>, was known in many parts of Africa as the &quot;sea monster&quot; or &quot;the ship from hell&quot;.  Obviously, it also had Irish connections, although it now is Dutch-registered.  These ships have also been run out of the waters of Australia and New Zealand amid protests and intervention by politicians.  Some assert that they are fishing with no quotas, while others state they have a small quota but that there are no controls over them.  I have been asked why a boat that has a quota to fish off Ireland for two to four weeks for a certain species, that is, for one month, would spend nine months fishing in Irish waters.  Is it not reasonable to expect, in the first instance, that these large trawlers should announce to the Irish authorities that they are coming into Irish waters to fish?  Second, they should have camera surveillance systems on board to monitor activities.  Third, they should allow officers of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to board to verify activities and, fourth, they should leave Irish waters once their quotas have been caught.  Ireland has full control - some would say excess control - over its own fleet in terms of quotas per Irish boat, whereas other boats such as boats from Spain have a national quota rather than a quota per boat, which makes it more difficult to verify or monitor whether overfishing is taking place.  Ultimately, how is it fair and equitable that Irish boats have to comply, while others may not be doing so?</p><p> This is about jobs and the economy, including processing jobs in factories such as the one in Rossaveal, and in our rural communities.  The EU is supposed to be about fairness and equality.  There are national quotas rather than quotas per boat.  How can this be fair if there is no proper monitoring of landings in other areas by these Dutch or German registered boats?  Is the EU turning a blind to issues?  Are there illegal activities going on?  Do these boats target Irish waters and then get out before the Naval Service can catch them?  Is the Minister confident that what is going on is above board, that the quota system and compliance by these boats with it is above board, and that we have nothing to worry about?</p></speech>

I have had a lot of interaction, particularly on social media, on this issue.  I can assure the Deputy that it is not going unnoticed in my Department or by the agencies with responsibility for enforcement of the rules.</p>  <p>  Control of vessels within Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone is as a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating in the area.  The control authorities have ongoing information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, including their activities and characteristics.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service.  As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters, including in relation to law enforcement.  Obviously, I ask what is going on and I ensure that the authority is applying the rules and regulations fairly and robustly.  The SFPA has advised me that it is currently monitoring the activity of four large pelagic freezer trawlers within the Irish exclusive fisheries zone.</p>  <p>  Vessels with the scope to catch large quantities of fish, with onboard grading facilities, create specific compliance risks, therefore justifying specific focus of available control resources.  For each of these, I am advised that the SFPA has clarified through contact with the flag state the entitlement of the vessel, and has identified particular compliance risks pertaining to those vessels.  Since their arrival in the Irish exclusive fisheries zone, the SFPA has been monitoring their movements through VMS, and declared catches through ERS.  In general terms, it advises that the declared catches have been consistent with limited processing capability that might exist in heavy weather.  Current weather conditions are heavy, to put it mildly.</p>  <p>  The SFPA is reliant on the seagoing fishery patrol activity of the Naval Service to verify compliance of vessels not landing into Ireland.  Boarding vessels of this size at sea creates specific challenges and to date, the operational decision of the Naval Service has been that the weather has been too severe to do that.  Our record in regard to large super-trawlers has been strong in the past 12 months.  We have brought a number of vessels into Killibegs for full inspection and so on.  I do not propose to read the lengthy note I have on this issue, a copy of which I am sure the Deputy has received and will read later in detail.  I would, however, like to reassure people on a couple of points.</p>  <p>  First, Ireland has a large fisheries area to patrol.  It is ten times our land mass in terms of surface.  It is among the most fertile fishing grounds not alone in the European Union but in the world.  It is a fishing ground shared among many international fleets.  Irish boats land about 20% of the catch.  It is my job to ensure that the enforcement agencies of the State, namely, the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, ensure that there are fair rules that apply to big and small boats, be they Irish owned or not.  These agencies must, in particular, ensure that boats that enter that zone to fish, but do not land in Ireland because in terms of scale they have processing facilities on board, comply with the rules and that there is no grading, discarding and so on.  It should not be forgotten that the discards ban introduced under the new Common Fisheries Policy, the concluding negotiations of which were chaired by Ireland, is in respect of the discard of fish in the pelagic sector.  This has been in place for the whole of this year.  We will be introducing an obligation to land into the white species from 1 January.  The rules are stringent and we will enforce them.  Current weather conditions are very rough, which means it is virtually impossible for the Naval Service to board these vessels.  If the weather changes that approach may change.  </p>  <p>  I know there is concern in regard to this area.  Ireland, too, has some very large pelagic trawlers.  Some of the Irish trawlers probably have a greater capacity to catch in terms of the day catch than do most of the large trawler vessels about which we are speaking because they have to process as well as catch.  There are some very large Irish vessels that fish in Irish waters and outside of Irish waters.  I know there is a concern in regard to the scale and size of these vessels, which are almost immune to stormy conditions such as currently being experienced.  I want to assure people that we are monitoring what they are doing and where they are and we want to enforce the rules strictly to ensure they are not catching beyond the quota they are allowed to catch within European waters.</p></speech>

I have received a copy of his response and I will read it more thoroughly after I leave the Chamber.  The Minister is correct that there is concern in this area.  I have been contacted by a number of fishermen and other people involved in the fishing community about the presence of these super-trawlers and their reputations.  The Minister is also correct that there are also many large Irish trawlers, with one of the largest trawlers in this area being Irish.</p>  <p>  The Minister is strongly supportive of the Celtic Sea project in regard to sustainable fishing.  Does he view these super-trawlers as a threat to the sustainability of fish stocks in Irish waters, European waters and across the world?  Is that an issue that is raised at fisheries meetings or an issue the Minister thinks is worthy of further examination?  The Minister said that Irish waters are some of the most fertile in the world and that 20% of the catch is by Irish boats.  It is because Irish waters are fertile that they are attractive to non-Irish trawlers.  The more catch that is landed in Irish ports the more jobs created in processing and the more net value there is to the Irish State.</p>  <p>  The Minister referenced current weather conditions.  We cannot put anybody's life at risk in terms of our Naval Service and the inspection of boats.  The view is that these super-trawlers target Irish waters when the weather is particularly bad in order that they might be able to evade detection by the Naval Service.  Is that speculation or is there evidence of this?  Is this an issue the Minister has discussed with the Naval Service or the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority?</p></speech>

Boats have electronic logbooks such that we know what is being caught.  Obviously, it helps to inspect to ensure that is the actual position.  We know where the vessels are as soon as they enter Irish waters.  If the Deputy were to visit the naval headquarters in Haulbowline staff there would be able to show him on screen the location of all fishing vessels in Irish waters at any given time, including a flag of the country of origin of each vessel.  They can also access logbook information from boats.  There is a lot of monitoring going on.  What people would like to see is physical verification of that monitoring through on-board inspections.  There are multiple boardings every day by the Naval Service.  It is a tough job but they do a good job.  They will board large vessels such as the super-trawlers about which we are speaking.  They will probably target large vessels more than small vessels as there is more at stake potentially because of the volumes being caught, be they Irish boats or other boats.</p>  <p>  People need to understand that we share fishing grounds within the European Union with other EU member states.  We negotiate in December of each year the quota within different fishing sectors around the Irish coast, as we do across the Bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean Sea and up into the Baltic Sea.  The quota that applies to each of those stocks in each of those zones is then divided among member states of the European Union in accordance with an agreed practise that has been going on now for many years.</p><p>Before fish are caught they must have a quota from a European member state that has a quota to catch fish, mackerel in this case, off the west coast of Ireland within this fisheries zone area.  It is not as if the vessels are appearing, scooping up all of our fish and heading off without the quota to do that.  The quota has been given to them on the basis of scientific advice in terms of the state of the stock and the health of that stock, coming from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, which is the international body that makes the scientific recommendations in terms of the health of mackerel stocks each year.</p> <p> This is not anything out of the ordinary in terms of fish that have been taken from waters for which we have responsibility for monitoring and managing from a fishery perspective.  This is quota fish that are being caught by boats that are owned within the European Union and have a quota to catch fish in that zone.  The issue for us is to make sure that they do not go beyond that quota, because given their scale and size they have the capacity to go way beyond it if they choose to and if there is not tight enforcement.  Those large vessels have significant catch capacity but they also know the consequences if they break the rules, which are significant.</p> <p> Because it is so stormy at the moment it is very difficult for us to get on board and to reassure people by verifying the catch and matching that with the electronic logbook data, but as soon as conditions allow for that we will do so.  As the Minister responsible for the fishing industry, nobody is more aware than I am of the need to protect fish stocks.  In the context of a new Common Fisheries Policy and a negotiated Common Fisheries Fund for Ireland, which is more than twice the size of any fisheries package that Ireland has ever had in the past, we are very serious about protecting Irish fishing interests, so if I felt that we had large super trawlers that were abusing stocks in Irish waters, I would act on that, but this is about enforcement, information flow, transparency and keeping the rules.  As soon as we have weather that can allow us to board those vessels, if the Naval Service and the SFPA feel it is appropriate to do so, that is what will happen.</p></speech>
