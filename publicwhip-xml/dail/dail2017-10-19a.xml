As my party leader indicated, budget 2018 is modest.  There are no spectacular frills or thrills, as is evident from some of the short deliberations of some senior Cabinet Ministers.  From my party's perspective, we are in the precarious position of being tied to the confidence and supply arrangement to ensure the continuation of the Government.  Of course, I would rather be on the other benches in government, be it in complete opposition to or for everything being done, but what we in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have done is to secure the core principle in the functioning of the Government, namely, having a spending ratio of 2:1 in terms of public expenditure and tax adjustments.</p><p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, set out in the Budget Statement many initiatives which have to be welcomed, but in some areas there are very few finite deadlines.  Various strategies have been put in motion, but when can we expect to see their implementation?  For example, a home building finance Ireland agency has been proposed, which is good news.  Builders need access to cheap loans, but do we need another agency and, if we do, when can we expect it to be in place?  </p><p>I acknowledge the housing crisis stemming from the level of homelessness and the need for more social housing, but there is also a shortage of private housing for individuals on low incomes.  Alas, there was no mention of affordable housing initiatives in the Budget Statement for people whose income bracket is above the social housing qualification limit but below the requirement for mortgage approval from financial institutions.  This is a sector that seems to have been forgotten about.  This, in turn, is putting additional strain on the rental property sector.</p><p>The increase in stamp duty on commercial property of 200% was almost put through without any acrimony only for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Finance getting their wires crossed.  When I wrote these notes a few days ago, I was going ask that they sit down and talk, but I am delighted to hear and I am hopeful that, with the publication of the Finance Bill, there will be some adjustments to the rate of stamp duty payable on the transfer of land between farmers' relatives.  It is welcome that that is happening and it must be welcomed to ensure the agriculture sector can grow at a competitive level.</p><p>Another budgetary measure that must be welcomed is the increase in the funding allocation for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That was one of my party's principles in the confidence and supply arrangement in facilitating the formation of the Government. <i></i></p><p>The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is also very much to be welcomed.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of a sugar tax which will have an impact in the context of the proposed alcohol Bill, given the increased consumption of spirits and soft drinks among young people.  We now see teenagers drinking whiskey which was unheard of a decade ago.  They are adding Coca Cola, Red Bull and other sweetened drinks to spirits.  This has led to the consumption of spirits going through the roof.  The sugar tax might, therefore, have an impact in the context of the proposed alcohol Bill in reducing the consumption of spirits. </p><p>Being my  party's spokesperson, I welcome the modest increase in funding for sport, about which there is very little in the Budget Statement.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, announced that there should be a total provision of &euro;60 million to fund sports capital grants.  It has been more than two years since the last allocation was made and the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, promised that we would have it this year, but we are still awaiting announcements in that respect.  I note that the funding seems to have been brought forward whereby we will be using next year's money to cover the allocation that I hope will be announced this year.  The increase in funding is welcome.</p><p>More money is to be allocated for the development of greenways, which has to be welcomed.  However, it is almost impossible to find a reference to it in the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe's budget briefing material.</p><p>On transport, only for the Taoiseach stepping in we would not know where we stand with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement last week various projects proposed within Dublin city.  Of the major road infrastructure projects mentioned that will be of any significance to people in the west or the south, I mention the Naas bypass upgrade and the Oberstown junction projects, as well as the improvements that will result from the Sallins bypass project.</p><p>In other ways, the budget gave nothing of significance to the people in the west and south of the country.  It is very disappointing that we had to wait until the Taoiseach came to Cork last Friday, where he was welcomed, to get a commitment on the M20.  We still have to get a commitment that the project will run from Cork to Dublin via Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville.  I am concerned that the rumour that the road being considered may go from Cork to Limerick via Cahir, which is the M8 and the N24, has not properly been dispelled.  It is a bit worrying.  I am from the north-eastern side of the constituency but I would ask that the constituency is put first when the call is being made.  I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to instruct Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to take the more direct route from Cork to Limerick and to make the proper amount of money available to enable the project to start immediately with ground works, surveys and costings so the road is built.  Some of us thought there was very little for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There were plenty of announcements but nothing good in respect of start-up works.  The Minister was delighted to see the Gort extension of the M17 was completed and brought in on schedule but for how long was that site opened?</p> <p> I quote my party leader when I say it was a modest budget but there are good elements to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Michael McGrath secured the phasing out of mortgage interest relief over three years as opposed to the initial proposal for a total reduction, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p> Being involved in the sports industry, I believe we should look seriously at the issue of bringing in stamp duties and at other ways of funding.  We have a valuable sports industry that needs funding to allow for upgrades, be it in the horseracing or the greyhound industries.  I hope there will be progress with regard to housing, which is a big issue, and infrastructure.  If we do not have the proper infrastructure we cannot drive commerce in this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900004#B00200"><p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the budget.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a Private Members' motion in the Chamber last night on pensions inequities and the implementation of the 2012 budget when the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, introduced the cut.  I know that people are tired of listening to the talk about this issue but I raised it last June after I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I could see the anomaly in what was a very severe cut, and especially in a woman introducing such a cut in a budget that affected mostly women.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  We had the debate last night, we will vote on it today and I implore the Government to look at the situation.  It is very unfair on those persons who are affected.  One of the possible solutions would be to bring back the homemaker claim.  From 1994 there was an allowance for a homemaker, for women who had to give up work to mind their children and who then went back into the workforce.  As a result their pensions have been badly cut.  There is an answer to this.  If the homemaker scheme could be backdated to prior to 1994, it could be a help and would go a long way to alleviate the difficulties being felt by those affected.</p>  <p>  The young farmers' scheme from the national reserve was a fund of &euro;25 million that was introduced in 2015 to support the farming community, in particular young, trained and qualified farmers.  Based on that 2015 funding commitment many young farmers rented lands, paying very high rents, and committed to six year leases because a six year lease was required to qualify for the scheme.  In 2016, unfortunately, no funds were made available for the scheme and in 2017 &euro;5 million was made available.  This leaves those farmers in dire circumstances.  I ask the Government to look at the situation again.  There is a vision for agriculture for the future to 2025, but I can tell the House that by 2020 many of these young and qualified farmers will be bankrupt if they do not get support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to help them stay in business.  Part of that agriculture plan looks to create 23,000 jobs in to the future.  Unless we get support for these people they will not be in business; they will be gone out of business.</p>  <p>  I will now turn to regional development.  I had a meeting recently with the CEO of IDA Ireland in the north west.  In fairness, it is trying to get employment to the regions and to get companies to move to the north west to create jobs.  It is, however, having great difficulty in this regard.  One of the main difficulties that was explained to me was the road infrastructure from Galway, and particularly from Dublin, to Sligo and that region.  This is the N4 section.  I am glad to see that the M4 was included in the Budget Statement, along with the M5 and the Macroom bypass.  The M4 extension is shovel ready, the lands have been compulsorily purchased and the deals have been agreed with the farmers and those who are to lose their houses.  Most of the people have been paid for their land and compensation and the road is fenced.  The project is shovel ready.  It is a crucial infrastructure development for the north-west region.  We need every advantage to try to get companies and foreign direct investment in to that area.</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of decentralisation of Departments on a number of occasions.  Decentralisation was announced in the 2003 budget by Fianna F&aacute;il and while it was a good programme, one of its faults was that the three-year timeframe was too ambitious.  It just could not be done in three years.  People may like to move but because of family commitments, such as children in school or university, they cannot make that decision in a three year-period.  I believe we should look at the idea again.  Dublin city is bursting at the seams and people cannot afford to buy houses.  They can barely afford to pay the rent.  Despite the fact they are in good jobs, and this includes people working in Departments, they still find it extremely difficult to survive in the city.  We should definitely look at moving Departments out in a very programmed way over a period of ten to 15 years.  It could mean a better quality of life for many people and would probably open up more accommodation in the city, which is already stretched to capacity.</p>  <p>  We met with the credit union movement this morning.  Credit unions have &euro;10 billion in available funds.  They do a small number of mortgages but the Central Bank should be encouraged to change the rules to allow credit unions to lend money to people to buy their homes.  In Ireland, especially in urban centres such as Dublin, Limerick and Galway, people are paying more in rent than they would for a mortgage to buy a house.  This is a sad situation to be in.  People are so stretched that they will never have a hope of putting together a 20% deposit.  If a person has a good credit rating and has paid his or her rent for the last four or five years without any issues, then he or she should be considered for a mortgage, especially as the money is there.  Mortgage lending is the most profitable lending that an institution can do.  The credit unions, unfortunately, cannot lend the money.  I know from my experience in auctioneering that banks are very selective in whom they lend to.  KBC advertise night and day on television but it does not say it is only lending in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  It does not say that it will not lend to people in rural areas; it is a fact that it does not.</p><p>It is time the banks were brought to heel, of that there is no question.</p> <p> The tenant purchase scheme has been debated in the D&aacute;il.  It is wrong that people who are on social welfare are not allowed to purchase their house, despite the fact they could be in it for 25 or 30 years.  This should be looked at and these people should be given an opportunity to purchase their house.  These houses are not going to become available.  The people are there and when they go, their families will be there.  They should be given this opportunity and the money that is collected from that should be used to provide more housing.  The local authorities should start building local authority houses.  In my home town of Ballymote, County Sligo, in 1947 the Government of the day built a housing scheme of 57 well-constructed houses, which are still standing today.  All that was ever done to them was that they were painted and looked after, and Storm Ophelia earlier this week did not put a dent in any of them.  We should be building more of those houses for people.</p> <p> I recognise it is an improvement that &euro;55 million will be made available to the National Treatment Purchase Fund this year.  This scheme was introduced in 2008 by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We had waiting lists at the time but the scheme definitely made a major dent into those lists and, if funding is made available next year, I have no doubt we will see a further reduction.  That we have 640,000 people on waiting lists is frightening.  We should recognise the fact that when people get into the medical system, they are very well looked after in all the hospitals.  However, getting into the system is the problem.</p> <p> The cancer strategy was very divisive, particularly in the north west, where people availing of cancer services had to go to Galway, in particular for radiotherapy.  Chemotherapy is available in the hospital in Sligo but the diagnostics and radiotherapy are in Galway.  I believe the technology currently available means this radiotherapy could be delivered in the north west, at a hospital like Sligo hospital, even though it would be administered from Galway.  This would save many thousands of people having to travel on buses to Galway or having to live in Galway for the period of their treatment, which might only be ten minutes of treatment per day for six weeks.  It would be helpful and is something that should be investigated.  I call on the Government to consider the possibility.</p> <p> The child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, is another issue in the north west, where there are serious difficulties.  There is a respite home in Sligo which catered for eight people and which was specifically built eight years ago at a cost of &euro;1.5 million to provide respite to parents by giving them a weekend or a few days off.  That service has recently closed and the building is being used for decongregation.  The people who were availing of the service now have to travel from Sligo to Monaghan, which is nearly a 350 km round trip with somebody who is probably in a wheelchair.  It is disgraceful.  A commitment was given by the Department that a new respite centre would be opened by the middle of this month but, as far as I am aware, a building has not even been identified where this service could be provided.</p> <p> Another issue that will arise next year is in regard to school transport.  While we had difficulties this year, the situation will be even more difficult next year.  Ahead of next year's programme, which will apply from early March, the Government needs to make provision to ensure the service can be run efficiently so people are not discommoded.  We were lucky that things worked out to some extent this year but I can foresee a lot of difficulties next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900005#C00200"><p>Like others, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak ahead of the Finance Bill which will give statutory effect to the budget of last week.  I welcome the positive developments that have taken place over the past five or six years and to recognise the sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and by many in this House, in particular in regard to the crucial decisions that had to be made to stabilise the country at a time of great distress.</p>  <p>  I listened to the various issues that have come to the fore in recent times.  Critics will always ask, "What have you been doing for the past five years?"  It never ceases to amaze me why some commentators do not seem to recognise that we were broke five years ago - no money, nothing, empty coffers, increasing demands, nowhere to go, nowhere to run.  A great task had to be undertaken by the then Government, with the support of some people in this House, which is acknowledged and accepted.  However, others saw the opportunity to undermine, to second-guess and to put forward unrealistic proposals which very often are about as good as they paper they are written on.</p>  <p>  We have now reached a situation where there is at least a basis on which to build our future.  For those who say it is not coming quick enough, of course, nothing ever comes quick enough - a watched kettle is the old familiar story.  It could not come any quicker for the simple reason that it takes time to recover and recovery is an ongoing process.  We also need to be careful to ensure we do not let it slip again.  This is a warning to us all.  We were, we do not ever want to be again where we were five or so years ago.  The sacrifices and efforts that were made by the people over the past years should not have to be made again to achieve that same purpose of surviving.  I hope that lesson has been well and truly learned at this stage and we can now go forward in the knowledge that our destiny is in our own hands.  We can plan ahead for the future in a realistic way and make the necessary decisions, which we are doing, and as time goes by the country will reap the benefits.</p>  <p>  There are still many challenges, of course, including in regard to infrastructure.  I agree with the speakers who say that vital elements of infrastructure are still required, in particular in regard to roads and transport, which are hugely important.  The previous speaker spoke about the N4.  I remember travelling during the summer on the road from Castlebaldwin towards Sligo, where there are 31 crosses on the roadside marking accidents where people lost their lives, no doubt as a result of roads that are incapable of taking the volume of traffic thrust upon them by today's requirements.  I particularly welcome the spending on roads, given the vital role they will play in the future economic development of the country.</p>  <p>  There are also infrastructural challenges in regard to hospitals.  Thankfully, the Government was in a position to be able to proceed with the new children's hospital, the new maternity hospital and a number of other major hospital developments throughout the country.  The list is endless and more is always required.  It is important that the Government at all times continues to strategically select the projects that require the most immediate attention and does its best to meet those demands.  I believe it is doing that, and doing it well.</p>  <p>  I spoke on the night of the budget about the application of stamp duty to the farming community, and I know something is being done to address this at present.  I mentioned that the proposal could have the direct opposite effect to what was intended.  In the meantime, I believe considerable discussions have taken place which, hopefully, will deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  The previous speaker mentioned the necessity to spread the fruits of the economy evenly throughout the country, which is correct.  We cannot continue to develop from east to west.  We have to put in place the infrastructure that is necessary to facilitate the development that has to take place throughout the other regions.</p><p>Whether it be in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway, Mayo, Sligo or wherever, we have to proceed vigorously to encourage investment.  I hope the recent and continued hiccups in respect of the investment in County Galway can be resolved fairly quickly.  We cannot afford to say to investors that we do not really need them here and that they should go somewhere else.  We have to make up our minds.  We either want investment or we do not.  We should recognise that it is a very competitive space.  There are others who encourage investment as well and we are up against them.  It is up to us to put our best foot forward.</p> <p> In respect of health, there are many challenges that will remain for some considerable time.  We are among the higher echelons of funding for health services among the OECD countries.  We need to step back and look at how we are spending our money.  Are we getting good value?  Money thrown at a situation, as has been shown in the past, does not necessarily produce the results.  There is an urgent necessity to evaluate what exactly is happening, apart from Sl&aacute;intecare altogether.  For example, we need to examine the long waiting lists.  Why do we have waiting lists?  We can attribute some of it to the bad economic time we have come through.  However, we have traditionally had a problem with waiting lists, to the extent that we have to ask ourselves what are the reasons.  There has to be some reason to which it can be attributed.  Is it because of lack of theatre space or theatre staff?  Is it because of a lack of consultants or general practitioners?</p> <p> I had an interesting exchange with officials from the HSE at the health committee yesterday.  I asked them the same question and nobody has answered it.  The fact remains that there are facilities in the public sector that are not utilised at all.  I do not know why.  The answer needs to be found and we should not have to wait forever for it.  A consultant recently remarked that in the private sector, he can do a full day's work from morning until late evening, without interruption and with all facilities available.  In the public sector, the same consultant might get two hours and then there will be a shortage of some facility.  Something is missing, a link in the chain is not there.  Why?  Unless we come to grips with that situation, we can spend all the money we like on our health services but it will not make a jot of difference.  What is the cause of the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments?  Is it because more people go there instead of to their general practitioner?  Is it because there are insufficient numbers of general practitioners?  What is happening there?</p> <p> Our population is increasing.  There is great emphasis being placed on the cohort of older people in the country but that is not accurate.  It is being put out as an excuse for almost everything.  In fact, the cohort of younger people is greater here than in most other European countries at present.  Many of those who left the country in the past, and who did not come back, were young people.  Many of those who left more recently during the recession did so for a shorter time, and came back.  They are here now.  They are young people in productive employment who are contributing to this economy.  It is not true or accurate to say the problem is that we have a lot of older people.  The sooner the system wakes up to that, the better.</p> <p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report, to which I was honoured to contribute, will address the issues.  However, unless it also addresses the structural issues, nothing is going to happen.  I emphasise what I said on many occasions during those discussions, namely, that I believe the HSE is the incorrect structure to deliver services throughout the country.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will not agree with me because their party abolished the old health boards.  I do not know whether they think that was a good idea now.  I do not think it was, although the health boards needed to be reformed.  The correct structure is to have about four regional bodies in which there would be local democracy and accountability and the input of professionals, be they general practitioners, consultants, hospitals or whatever.  They should be involved in decision making at local level, as well as in the responsibility that goes with it.  We would then be able to send representatives from those bodies to a national structure which could be similar to the HSE.  At present, I cannot see how it is ever going to work.  From the beginning, the HSE was not the correct structure to run the services throughout the country.  The talents and dedication of those within the health service are better tapped when responsibility is given to them at local level.  Some people would say there should be no politicians on any such body or board but that is not correct.  Politicians are elected by the public to represent them and, like everybody else, they have to be at the coalface playing a responsible role and dealing with the situations that arise.</p> <p> The other thing that, sadly and tragically, has not gone away is the housing situation.  Other speakers have referred to it.  Going back as far as the Administration that preceded the last Government, I saw what was happening, as did many others who are still Members of the House, including the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  It was quite obvious to some of us that we were heading into a major catastrophe, because we were not building on an ongoing basis.  We were not replenishing our housing stock and were not creating affordable houses for those who were in an income bracket in which they could not afford to risk borrowing above their heads.  Unfortunately, we have not addressed that yet.  I compliment the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the work that is being done and that is still to unfold.  However, it is like the mills of God that move exceeding slow.  Unless we can accelerate the programme in a really meaningful way in the shortest possible time, this sadly is going to get much worse.  Of course we should not have people sleeping on the streets and under bridges.  However, that is not the major issue.  It is the result of the other issues of crowding and pressure in the market space.  It takes three incomes now to fund a mortgage on an ordinary three-bedroom, semi-detached house.  We can work it out any way we like.  A mortgage used to be two and a half times the income under the old system.  It is now three times the income but, either way, two people have to work full time in the household to just barely make ends meet.  After that, if anything goes wrong or if somebody falls ill, there is a problem.  There is a lot of work to be done yet.  It requires emergency treatment now.</p> <p> There are those here who suggest from time to time that nobody thought about it but themselves.  Some of us were talking about this many years ago, long before it happened and became obvious.  It was clear to us that things were not happening as they should at local level.  In my own county in the 1980s, it was deemed that there was a requirement of about 1,000 houses per annum.  There were two ways to do that.  We could have direct build local authority houses and local authority loans, and we could also develop private sites, which we did.  We made 800 to 900 houses available to people within particular income brackets on an annual basis, even through the midst of economic difficulties.  There was not a great deal of money available in the country then.  It worked very well.  We had the housing finance industry loans at the time.  They were criticised afterwards by other lending agencies, of course, wrongly so.  They made loans available to people who would not get a loan anywhere else at that time.  They gave people pride in what they were doing, in their own home and in their work and the commitment they were making to the economy.  People were delighted to take that responsibility.</p><p>We need to do much more in the context of an accelerated programme to deal with the housing issue.  Building has commenced and it is accelerating, which is welcome, but time is of the essence.  Those who have been squeezed and who have been waiting for such a long time are at breaking point.</p> <p> I would like to mention the issue that has engaged many in the past few weeks in respect of banking, that of overcharging, switching, pressure and so on with which some of us have been dealing behind the scenes for a long time.  We have been face to face with the bankers and their representatives and sometimes they were not very nice.  We witnessed at first hand the attitude in lending institutions and what they thought of their customers and public representatives.  We had to go into court time and again to plead on behalf of constituents.  Sometimes we were welcome in the banks, but we were not welcomed at all times  These issues have been arising not only in recent times but for the past eight years at least.  Many were squeezed during that period and forced out of their houses.  They suffered greatly and tragically throughout and I hope we have learned lessons.</p> <p> I am delighted that the Minister for Finance is inviting the chief executive officers of the lending institutions to visit him next week.  I hope he will speak to them in the words that need to be spoken.  A few years ago one bank official said to me and a customer I was representing, "I am a businessman."  I thought of other descriptions at the same time and told him so.  We represent the people and they are not always wrong.  When they cry out for help, we need to recognise what they are saying and tell them that we are here to help.  I also hope the Minister will extend his invitation to the venture capitalists who have taken over some distressed loans.  Some of them have been affable and willing to entertain customers, while others have not.  The only contribution they have made is causing greater distress and they appear intent on doing nothing less.  I hope the Minister will encourage them to recognise the difference between those who have struggled and paid in the past few years and those who did not pay at all because it could come to pass that those who did not pay and walked away will be thanked as well as those who struggled to make payments to the best of their ability.  I hope this will be included in his portfolio on the day.</p> <p> There are challenging times ahead.  Nothing was ever going to be easy, as stated in the advertisement.  The challenging times arise from Brexit, retrenchment in the United States and the discouragement of the international community in terms of foreign direct investment.  We have our own begrudgers in Europe.  Some speak out on a regular basis, for example, about the Apple tax.  It is now suggested Ireland should collect taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions, which is completely at variance with the regulations.  It also represents an interference with the internal taxation regime in a particular county.  This is being done to target a country that has benefited significantly from foreign direct investment, but it is not one-way traffic.  Many Irish investors have invested freely abroad on a regular basis.  Mr. Martin Naughton was correctly honoured in recent days by Dublin City University for his work in this area.  CRH and various others have done the same all over the world.  If there is retrenchment globally, everybody will be hurt, but there are those who think the more powerful will succeed.  They might for a while, but ultimately they will not.</p> <p> I would love to air the rest of my grievances, but it would take much longer than the time I have available.  I thank the Acting Chairman</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900007#E00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget that was announced last week.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on communications, climate action and the environment, I intend to confine my remarks to my portfolio.  Many other areas have been well and truly covered by my colleagues.  </p><p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to a statement made by the Taoiseach in appointing his Cabinet.  He said:</p><blockquote>I am determined that the Government should show new ambition when it comes to tackling climate change by setting out a roadmap to a low-carbon economy.  Climate change will be the first item to be discussed at our first full day strategic Cabinet meeting.</blockquote><p>They were fine words, but, unfortunately, whatever the outcome of the discussions that took place at that meeting, they had no influence on his first budget as Taoiseach.  It does not take a rocket scientist to peruse the budgetary proposals from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the next year.  Absolutely no ambition has been shown to address the issue of climate change.  If we were talking about climate change in the abstract, that might be okay, but a previous Government signed up to binding targets, which must be met by 2020.  We have committed to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in the usage of renewables.  The Environmental Protection Agency's recent report makes it clear that we are on target to miss these targets significantly.  The projections are wide and varied regarding the fines that will be levied on the State in 2020, but they could be between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  It is, therefore, not good enough for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to abdicate his responsibility and ask from where the money will come to meet the targets because the next question surely is from where will the money come to pay the fines that will be levied in 2020.  If the Government somehow believes a relatively benign approach will be taken at European level, that does not gel with the contacts I have had with colleagues in other member states and within the Brussels architecture.  The Government has engaged in window dressing in suggesting it has discussed this issue, but it seems to have filed the issue of climate action on some shelf.</p><p>One of the significant drivers has to be encouraging people to use electric vehicles and the only way that can be done is through appropriate incentivisation.  I have examined the targets set in Norway and what has been achieved there.  The uptake of electric vehicles has been enormous in comparison to Ireland.  Free tolling and free parking are provided for, while bus lanes can be used by drivers of electric vehicles.  In an effort to touch base, the Minister has introduced in next year's budget the notion of a benefit-in-kind rate of zero, with a moratorium of one year and a promise to review the position thereafter in the purchase of such vehicles.  The Minister of State will understand the way companies make decisions.  Much has been made of our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  A reduction of 0.5% or 1% would not matter a damn to the companies concerned.  The reason the rate cannot be changed is that it would remove certainty.  There is certainty in Ireland about our corporation tax rate.  If a measure was to be introduced in the budget whereby the staff of companies and fleet owners provided with electric vehicles would not be charged benefit-in-kind for only one year, there would be no certainty.</p><p>As sure as night follows day, the uptake will be very limited.  I have spoken to people within the industry who own significant fleets and could make a major dent in increasing the amount of electric vehicles in the country.  They have asked why the Government would impose that on employees and then require them to pay a significant BIK the following year.  Had it been done for five years with a review thereafter, given the lifecycle of a car of four five years, at least that would give certainty.</p> <p> That measure was much heralded and trumpeted by a Minister who has come to be recognised now as almost a court jester.  Whenever there is an event not related to his Department but in some way vaguely relevant, he is there.  He is on the radio and television.  Yesterday he was there to welcome the electricity repair crews coming from Northern Ireland.  He has a host of engagements in his constituency.  He is like the court jester who is asked to open a pub and by the end of his presentation he is talking in the collective.  It is "we"; the court jester owns the pub.</p> <p> We see the same from the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on all these issues.  If somebody else is doing something, he thinks he is involved in it by association and it has happened as a result of his efforts and those of the Government.  We saw it again this morning.  Google has introduced mapping technology to allow emergency services to pinpoint the location of a caller to the 999 or 112 service.  The Minister was asked to launch it.  He has taken on a much greater role.  It is "we", "us" and "the Government"; it is amazing.  It would not matter if it was not so serious, but it is acting as a distraction from addressing the real issues.  In something like this the Minister could make a real name for himself and be able to use the collective in saying, "We, as a Government, have done something", rather than claiming responsibility as he does.</p> <p> Turning to the issue of broadband, the budget allocated &euro;15 million, which will just about pay the consultants carrying out the procurement process.  We will not achieve anything on broadband this year.  No shovel will be placed in the ground and no home will be connected under the national broadband plan.  However, I am sure the Minister will quickly issue a press release outlining the number of farms and post offices being connected every day and claiming that "We, the Government, are making all this happen".  This is another example of claiming responsibility for corporate decisions by Eir, SIRO, Virgin Media and other providers.  It is amazing that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, claims responsibility for something he has nothing to do with.</p> <p> There is an ultimate failure to address the 540,000 homes without broadband.  Nothing in the budget indicates they are any closer to being connected to a high-speed broadband service.  It does not deter the Minister running along like the court jester, believing he is part of something great.  Unfortunately it is no joke from a climate-change perspective.  It is no joke, given the need for the country to face up to the challenges associated with our targets for 2020.  It is certainly no help to the 540,000 households with no light at the end of the tunnel for a broadband connection.</p> <p> Post offices also fall under this Department's remit.  The Government initiated a process of engagement between postmasters, the Government and An Post.  Bobby Kerr, an eminent businessman and a very practical person, published a report.  At the time the Government signed up to it and indicated that it effectively planned a roadmap for the future of the post office network.  Mr. Kerr suggested that An Post should consider what kinds of services are being delivered; whether a greater number of services could be delivered in post offices; and what would help to assist the An Post network to become more commercially viable.  It was very clear that it would need Government support and intervention if the Government believed in having a widespread post office network.</p> <p> I had an opportunity to visit a post office in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  I am sure he is well aware of the importance of the retention of the post office in Old Pallas.  I met old people there, some of whom voted for the Minister of State.  They are the same kinds of people I meet in my constituency every week.  They recognise that people are not going into and out of post offices the way they did years ago.  Therefore viability is an issue.  Even if only 50% of the transactions now happen electronically, including social welfare and pension payments being transferred directly into their banks, it is not appropriate to close that post office.  What do we say to the other 50%?  Even if it goes as low as 20% of the activity that was there previously, it is not right to say to the remaining 20%, "Tough, it is no longer viable".  That is the State turning its back on people.</p> <p> The Taoiseach referenced it the other day and he knows the importance of keeping the harp over the door in those communities.  Unless the Minister, Deputy Naughten, steps into the ring at some point, post offices will close by stealth.  Every week post offices are being reviewed on a three- and five-year basis.  The number of transactions is dropping.  They are subcontractors to An Post and their money is cut because their activity has gone down.  They cannot survive and are closing the doors themselves.</p> <p> If the Minister, Deputy Naughten, believes that this somehow absolves him from responsibility, if he somehow thinks that because the contractors have made the decision themselves to close then that it is okay, I have news for him and for the Government.  It is not okay because the people who still require the service are voters and taxpayers pensioners and social welfare recipients.  They have a stake in society.  They might not gel with the Minister's friends in Google for which he is acting the court jester this morning.  These are real people who have made a contribution to the State and they deserve to be respected.  They are entitled to the same services as everybody else who might be more computer literate, and more mobile and connected.  They are real people and they deserve a service.</p> <p> I believe that the 1,000 to 1,100 post offices we have is about right.  An Post will not be able to maintain that network if it is forced to do it from current activities.  It will require intervention from the State.  I believe it probably requires between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million a year from the central Exchequer.  That is not a number picked from the air.  The Kerr report had costings of between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million over a five-year period.  Therefore, &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million - it might cost more if people seek to retire - would protect the network for the next five years.</p> <p> No line item in the budget allocated to the Minister, Deputy Naughten, would suggest he is cognisant of the challenge facing the post office network or that he has any intention of committing resources from the central Exchequer to support the network.  He will utter fine words.  When, a number of years ago he and the then Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ring, quibbled over who had responsibility for the post office network again, in another shouldering up or manning up, he said he would take on the network.  He took it, all right.  He took political responsibility but he certainly did not support it with any level of finance, which is very disheartening for the men and women who are attempting to keep the post offices open, who believe in their communities, and who care about the people who use the post office.  In many cases it is their only social interaction.</p><p>If we devalue that as a society, run headlong after the smart economy, of which I am a supporter, and somehow distance ourselves or become entirely dislocated from the people for whom that is not a way of life, then as politicians we will have lost our way.  We must be able, as Deputy Durkan has said, to represent all the people all the time.  That is our duty and our responsibility.  Of course I am all for technology, but the Minister is not following through on that side either.  He is dragging his heels in respect of the people living outside the areas that the commercial operators see as suitable for service provision on a commercial basis.  He has succeeded in creating the most complex tender and procurement procedure ever organised by Government.  He is right when he says this is taxpayers' money that must be protected, but surely to God it can be done in a more time-efficient way.  We are now down to two contractors, such is the cumbersome nature of the way in which he has allowed this process to develop.  He somehow believes that because it is complex and he has all the jargon, words and acronyms, that somehow confuses people.  I have news for him: it does not.  All they want to know is when the Government will treat people who live in rural areas fairly, and they are not being treated fairly.  There is no roadmap, no start date for the work to begin on the national broadband plan, no date by which contracts must be signed, no date for a contractor to start and no finish date.  Project management 101 would suggest that the first thing one does on any project, after having scoped it and understood what one wants to do, is to pick a start date and, if hiring a contractor, to put on a calendar a date by which the contract will be signed.  Even if there is a bit of mission creep and the project goes on for an extra week or an extra month, one gets over that - but one sets a target.  There must be a target date for the contract to be agreed and signed, a target date for the work to begin and a target date for it to finish.  However, the Minister is too afraid to put a date in the calendar because he would then have to accept political responsibility for failing to meet that date.  This is why I term the Minister a court jester.  He is there for the good times, the laughs and the opening of various events but not prepared to put his neck on the line, get behind the project and bring it to a conclusion.  This is so serious in terms of the impact on our climate and our post office network and, unfortunately, as I said, the Minister has failed abysmally.</p> <p> Then there is the issue of the climate change targets I talked about.  There is nothing in the budget about this.  The Minister talks about a renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, in the context of the renewable heat scheme, for which &euro;17 million is set aside.  This also includes the cost of the roll-out of electric vehicles.  This is an absolutely minuscule amount of money for that initiative.  It goes nowhere towards meeting our targets.  Yes, there is some money - I will give credit where it is due - to expand the energy efficiency programme by investing an additional &euro;35 million in the residential, commercial and public sectors for the reduction of CO2 emissions from the built environment.  This and anything else that can help in this regard are welcome because we are falling way behind in use of renewables in heat, but these are just minor amounts of money in the context of what we must achieve by 2020.  The Minister is used to saying to advocacy groups that he may not be the Minister next year.  He may not be next year or in two years' time, but some representative cabinet will have to face the fines from Europe in 2020.  If the Minister's view is so short-term that he does not believe he will be the Minister by then and, therefore, the matter does not really trouble or worry him, it shows the kind of poor ambition of the Taoiseach if he is not prepared to drive the Minister in reaching his responsibilities.  It is appalling.</p> <p> Another area, which I may not have enough time to address adequately, is public service broadcasting.  This is handled principally by RTE, but many of our local and regional radio stations carry out, under licence, a very important role in public service broadcasting.  I have a Bill which I have shared with the secretariat of the House, which I hope will come before the House relatively shortly and which I hope will get support from the other side of the House.  It would see financial support given to public service broadcasters in the independent radio sector.  There is no indication in the budget that the Minister is even considering this.  He has a consultation process around the collection of the television licence fee.  We are way behind every other country in Europe in the collection of our licence fee.  About 15% or 16% is not collected.  RTE is looking for additional money and the local radio sector is looking for money.  There is a pot of money out there if only it were collected.  This could be done through the Revenue Commissioners - simple - but the Minister has another consultation process and another procurement process and, by the time it is all resolved, I suppose he will not be Minister anyway so it will not matter.</p> <p> What we need are decisions, and usually decisions that are taken are identified in the Finance Act and the Budget Statement because decisions usually require money.  If the Minister, Deputy Naughten, representing the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, intends to take decisions, they will be of a very woolly nature because he has identified few if any changes in his budget for next year to achieve anything in an area that is crying out for action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900009#G00200"><p>I am not quite sure where the confidence and supply agreement begins and ends regarding a budget.  I am no great fan of the arrangement, like many others around the country.  If ever one needed evidence of lack of delivery on the part of a government, one need only look at this budget.  One will hear the normal clich&eacute;s trotted out - "missed opportunity" and so on - but it is clear evidence that the Government does not understand that its first obligation is to keep its people safe.  It is a clear indication to me that no imagination was shown and no vision displayed in the budget.  It is simply a budget that has been cobbled together to keep this show on the road.  That is the reality of this budget.  As a result, the big winners continue to be big winners.</p>  <p>  For example, I have seen in the newspapers over the past few days - perhaps it was just today - that the State has paid &euro;221 million in legal fees.  Let us examine that in the context of the budget.  This morning the Central Bank is before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, where the members are trying to hold the bank to account regarding the tracker mortgage issue.  That bank spent &euro;7.5 million in legal fees in one year.  How much of that was caused by the fact that the banks generally continue to drag their feet on their responsibilities, refuse to accept there is a tracker mortgage issue and refuse to deal with the full cohort of people and customers affected by the issue and, as a result, cause the bank to have to buy in expertise and legal fees?  That is the impact that private sector activity has on the budget for this country.  It forces an agency of the State to spend greater amounts of taxpayers' money on legal and professional fees.  That is what is going on.  It is a never-ending cycle, and the Committee of Public Accounts every week discovers all the inefficiencies and poor spending for the State.  The committee reports it to the line Minister, who in turn reports it to the Minister of State responsible, and one gets the normal report back, which generally gives a blas&eacute; explanation as to why it had to be done.</p><p>Were this a business, it would probably be closed down because it is inefficient, ineffective and losing money hand over fist to the private sector, which is draining the State of valuable resources.</p> <p> One need only consider the spend thereafter on, for example, education.  The universities are demanding more money and we are demanding that there be universities in, for example, Waterford in the south east.  I do not disagree with any of that, but I do disagree with the amount of money that universities are spending to achieve it, to keep their people safe and to look after their employees.  There is evidence of significant waste in that sector, with money being spent on paintings or &euro;13,000 being spent on retirement parties for individuals, while those in the sector who have made complaints under whistleblowing legislation have not been paid for three or four years.  Someone needs to hold those colleges to account.  In particular, someone needs to tell CIT that, as required by legislation, it needs to pay members of its staff when they are on leave because they blew the whistle on some scandal or other.</p> <p> The same applies to the Garda and the Prison Service.  The latter is in crisis.  Numerous prison officers are out sick because of incidents in which they were badly injured by prisoners while at work.  They have been put on suspended leave and are not being paid fully.  They must fight for their wages.  That is a scandal in itself, but when one considers the amount of taxpayers' money that is being used to prop up a system that does not work and has poor HR management systems in every sector, is it any wonder that there are problems with staff?</p> <p> I challenge the Minister of State to put in place a more responsive dedicated unit rather than the &euro;5 million on spin within the Taoiseach's office, attach that spend to the Committee of Public Accounts and take real action on reports that are being made available to various Ministers with a view towards change and reform.  They are reluctantly considering, and desperately avoiding, reform because it may bring about greater efficiencies in how taxpayers' money is spent.</p> <p> I wish to address the major issues in the budget.  I acknowledge the work that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing on housing, but I am afraid that he is experiencing the reluctance of local authorities to build.  How is it that large housing schemes were constructed throughout the country in the 1950s and 1960s when there was little expertise or money but there was a drastic need for public housing?  Local authorities did that work well.  They now have the expertise and vast amounts of money, yet for some reason they are unable to deliver.  They do not build houses.  They no longer collect rubbish.  They no longer have anything to do with water.  What in the name of God are county managers actually doing?  For what are they getting paid?  The Minister needs to call them in again and tell them to build or buy the houses that are necessary if the waiting lists that exist in every county are to be reduced.  There are 3,500 people on the list in Kilkenny, a number of sites that are ready to be built on and developers who are ready to construct, yet there is no appetite within the local authority to do it.</p> <p> I challenge the Minister to make available a scheme, such as the shared ownership or grant scheme, to ensure that that the block of people in the middle, who do not qualify for local authority housing because they are over the money threshold even though they do not have enough to qualify for a loan, are included on some list.  A scheme should be made available to such people so that they might buy or construct a house for their family.  I want local authorities to build extensions to keep people in their homes.  There is almost a refusal by local authorities to do that kind of work.</p> <p> I want local authorities to buy houses for the families of children with special needs.  For several years, I have raised in the Chamber a case that I have been dealing with in Kilkenny.  The Respond! Housing Association has three units that could each house a family.  It has planning permission.  However, for ten years or more that site has remained idle.  A house was constructed that could house a family with special needs but it has been vacant for at least ten years.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and Respond! but nothing has happened because the connection between the Minister, Respond! and the local authority is gone.  They no longer respect public representatives.  In fact, we are a nuisance.  I challenge Deputies to pick up the phone right now and telephone their county managers, then tell me whether they get through.  County managers pay lipservice to the legislation when meeting Oireachtas Members.  Were the Minister to exercise his authority where it was necessary to make them do their job, we would have houses on the ground.  There is no need for a further agency, just as there is no need for an agency to make cheap money available to developers.  We own AIB and have a share in another bank.  Why can the Government not tell them to loan a particular amount of money in a particular scheme?</p> <p> We are too fond of creating quangos in this country and outsourcing problems to other agencies.  That is rife within the HSE, which is essentially dysfunctional.  It does not know how many managers it has.  It knows that it has too many, that there are more managers than front-line staff and that more respect is given to managers than to front-line staff, yet the latter are the Band-Aid holding all of the HSE's services together.  Without them, their dedication and their passion, the health service would be in a worse situation.</p> <p> How capable is the management of the HSE in respect of its services and the money that the Government gives it?  The HSE still does not have a single accounting system.  Rather, there are a number of systems across the country that do not speak with one another.  As a result, the HSE does not know what is happening in the health service at any given time.  What we do know is that, in each year over the past few years, the HSE has almost tipped &euro;1 billion in overspending.  It has received an increase in this year's budget, but that will only offset what it overspent last year.  The HSE is constantly running ahead of its spend and is marching just to stand still.  It is crazy that the HSE does not have someone who will take responsibility.  I have no confidence in its management.  I have the greatest of confidence in its staff because, once someone is in their care, he or she progresses well.  However, the waiting list to get into their care incurs a major human cost.</p> <p> I urge reform of and greater accountability in the HSE, with a management structure to equal any business on the front line of best practice in this country.  That is necessary.  Change managers are needed to ensure that the reforms required to bring about a better health service are enacted.</p><p>Politicians act in good faith, now as they did in the past, and try to do their best, but they are challenged by a system that beats them down over the short period a Minister holds office.<br/><br/>It is the same with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had a crisis in the Garda that went on for months on end and resulted in the departure of two Commissioners and a Minister, yet I have not heard the House debate the new plan and strategy for the force.  I have not heard any discussion of it.  I challenge the Government to bring its plan to the floor of the House.  A strategy is needed because no single person can manage a force with 12,000 to 14,000 members and be the Accounting Officer before D&aacute;il committees week in and week out as well as appearing before the other organisation overseeing the Garda.  With respect to those within the force, it needs a new, modern and dynamic system of management.  There is a need for education for those who want to join the force such as there is for doctors or nurses.  Why do we not have courses like that for the Garda?  Why is there no officer corps within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as there is in the Army?  Why do we not break down the force according to its responsibilities as is done in France and then make them accountable for the money they spend?  They do not have a single system of accounting within their force.<br/><br/>If I stand up to criticise the Garda, the health service or a local authority, I want to be able to do so with the intention of trying to improve their lot.  I want to see a better force.  Politicians, however, do not ensure that a better management system and a better force is provided for.  That is where we fall down.  When Mary Harney was Minister, I called for a truce around health whereby we would all buy into the same policy and try to support the Department's patient-centred initiatives.  We had it recently in the health committee, but when it brought forward its strategy, the money was not put behind it.  Nothing happened.<br/><br/>The one issue in health which we have to grasp is mental health.  We talk about it in the House and say there are millions available, but what happens on the ground thereafter is shocking.  Young people with mental health issues who turn up for care do not get it.  I know of numerous cases where people turned up for care, were refused or received the wrong care or ended up in a community setting and subsequently took their own lives.  That is a fact and we have to do something to address it.  If we do not have the fully qualified people at the front line, we must do something about it.  Our young people are being destroyed by the challenges of life for which they are unprepared, for some reason or other, and we have to reach out to them.  The services are not there, however.  The same thing happens as older people go through life and come to need support and services.<br/><br/>The single complaint that emerges loud and clear from life in modern Ireland is the fact that the banks have driven so many people to their deaths.  Many people have committed suicide because the banks have spent every single day tormenting families to collect money.  One vulture fund recently told a client that it did not care where he got the money.  He was told to ask friends, neighbours, family, his mother, his father or the credit union as long as he got the money.  &quot;We want money&quot; is the attitude of a manager in a vulture fund.  As long as we allow that to happen without regulation, the quality of people's lives will be tested day in and day out.  The Central Bank will acknowledge this morning that its does not have the powers to deal with the tracker mortgage issue.  It does not have the extended powers necessary to tell banks to pay the cohort of people who have been proven to have been put on the wrong rate and proven to have been taken off the tracker.  The Central Bank does not have the power and so it tries to cajole the banks or put moral pressure on them.  No bank, to my knowledge, understands moral pressure.  Banks understand their bottom line and the need to protect it and they ignore what we say in the House.<br/><br/>While I welcome the statement of the Taoiseach yesterday and the fact that the banks are being brought in to explain their stance, he and the Minister for Finance should beat up on the lot of them.  They should threaten to withdraw their licences or to restrict them.  There are other players in the market.  <i>Sparkassen</i>banks in Germany want their model to be permitted in this country.  Today in Germany, ten year tracker rates stand at 1.1% but one cannot get that here.  The banks are running roughshod over every well-intentioned politician and regulator because they can.  We should ensure by way of legislation and penalties of one kind or another that the day comes when the banks cannot do that.  The day must come after which headlines asking why no one will stand up to our bullying banks never again appear in our newspapers.  The banks should not be allowed to bully families or individuals.  Addressing that is the responsibility of Government and it is what I mean when I say any Government is obliged to keep its people safe.  We have not done that.</p></speech>

I welcome the prudent approach adopted as we need to learn lessons from the reckless financial management of the past which brought us to the brink of bankruptcy.  To that end, I welcome the establishment of the rainy day fund with an investment of &euro;1.5 billion.  I also welcome the capital plan which is crucial to the delivery of key priority projects in social housing, roads and schools and will be critical as we move to develop our 2040 planning framework.  I greatly look forward to contributing to that process and to proposing investment and connectivity to Offaly through access to our county town of Tullamore via a link from the N6 at Kilbeggan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in HAP funding which will be very helpful for people looking to accommodate themselves in their local areas.  I welcome also the investment next year in new social housing.  There are very many working people who simply cannot provide a house for themselves.  The one thing we can do is to ensure people can get a roof over their heads as that is where they can make a great start in life.</p>  <p>  The increase in stamp duty from 2% to 6% has been a cause of concern for many, in particular those who are midway through transactions and have budgeted for the lower rate.  I hope it will be clarified that if contracts have been signed and deposits have been paid over, people will pay the 2% which they understood they had to budget for rather than the 6% rate.  I appreciate that it is 6% for new transactions.  A number of farming families have also contacted me on the age for transfers, which they feel is too low at 67.  I hope we will be able to increase it.</p>  <p>  Last year, I welcomed the investment of &euro;5 million through budget 2017 to establish the Healthy Ireland fund.</p><p>I welcome the additional investment of &euro;5 million, which underpins the commitment to the Healthy Ireland framework.  However, it is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed.  I would like to see that funding increased year-on-year rather than remain at &euro;5 million because the Healthy Ireland framework is essential in preventing physical and mental illness.  Prevention should be our objective.<br/><br/>I also welcome the introduction of the sugar tax, which was flagged last year.  However, I would prefer if it had been hypothecated to be targeted specifically at tackling the challenges of obesity, be that in relation to people in need of bariatric surgery, investment in our secondary schools and colleges or ourselves to improve our own quality of life.  I appeal to the Department of Finance to reconsider its proposed use of the yield from this tax.  Prevention is not spoken about enough in relation to this area.  I welcome the investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the recruitment of an additional 800 Garda and 500 civilian staff.  I also welcome all of the other services that are being rolled out through the Department of Justice and Equality, including the additional funding for CCTV systems and community text alert schemes.<br/><br/>Brexit is the greatest challenge to our country and economy in recent times.  Our SMEs, which are the backbone of our communities, having access to the Brexit loan scheme at low interest rates is to be welcomed, as is the retention of the 9% VAT rate to support the hospitality sector, which I believe really needs assistance.  While this sector is booming in particular areas, the 9% VAT rate is vital to counties like Offaly that are still developing their fantastic tourism product.<br/><br/>I welcome the additional funding for the cultural sector, including the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board, Culture Ireland, the national cultural institutions and the creative children initiative, Waterways Ireland and many other agencies associated with our built and natural heritage.  However, as I have said time and again the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht does not get enough money.  The Minister and her officials can only do so much with the money they are given.  In Irish society, we are achieving enormously in the arts.  We should be investing more in this area by way of a capital funding programme for the arts, similar to the sports capital programme.  We are not only achieving at national level but at international level in terms of our writers, singers and actors.  We need to do more for them.<br/><br/>As stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, climate change is the global challenge of our generation.  It was fantastic to hear a Minister for Finance acknowledging this because as a society, and individually, we are answerable to our children and grandchildren for our actions or, more important, inactions in terms of reducing our carbon footprint.  There is an onus on us to ensure a reduction in energy use in all public-owned buildings.  I welcome the allocation to facilitate energy efficiency programmes because a reduction in energy use in public buildings, commercial buildings and the residential sector will make a huge difference.  I also welcome the allocation of &euro;17 million for the renewable heat incentive.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant, the VRT relief and new 0% rate of benefit-in-kind will incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.  However, if we are serious about moving to electric vehicles then we must address the issue of distances and the lack of charging points.  If I had an electric car, the only place I could charge it is on the far side of Merrion Square.  That is the only charging point around here.  This issue needs to be addressed in the context of new housing and commercial developments.  We need more charging points in public places.  People will not make the move to electric cars if there are not sufficient charging points.<br/><br/>I welcome the changes in the social welfare area, including the &euro;5 per week increase in all weekly social welfare payments, the telephone support allowance, about which I know many of us have received representations, the increase in family income supplement, FIS, and the &euro;2 per week increase in the qualified child payment.  There are also other changes in terms of prescription charges and so on which I believe will be of real benefit to families and individuals.<br/><br/>Taxation is a matter that exercises us all, particularly the workers who kept the show on the road when the country was in austerity and striving to manage.  They went to work every day and paid USC, the pension levy and their taxes.  It was wrong that people moved to the high rate of tax on reaching &euro;33,800.  I welcome that the threshold in this regard has been increased to &euro;34,500.  In terms of attracting home our emigrants who left in times of austerity this is a really good move in the right direction.  It will ensure that take home pay is attractive to them.  The reduction in the USC rates from 2.5% to 2% and 5% to 4.75% is also welcome and will be vital in that regard.<br/><br/>I referred to SMEs earlier.  We need to focus on them more and to acknowledge what they are doing in their communities, regardless of whether they employ one, two, five or ten people.  It is incumbent on us as public representatives to recognise the fantastic work they do in providing services in our communities and employing people.  There is often a great deal of focus on foreign direct investment and what US companies are considering locating in our towns and so on.  We need to focus on the businesses already operating in our towns.  For example, Grant Engineering in Birr and Glenisk Limited, which produces dairy products such as yoghurt, are fabulous local companies in my area which employ local people and will not up and leave when tax breaks run out.  These businesses are invested in our communities and we need to focus more on them.  The increase in earned income credit of &euro;200 which brings the overall threshold to &euro;1,150 is very welcome.  It sends out the strong message to vital people in our communities that we appreciate them. <br/><br/>I welcome the rural social scheme and the increase in placements on the scheme to 250.  The scheme is providing a fantastic service on a number of levels, socially and economically, for people in our communities.  It is important people are able to learn new skills and to meet and connect with new people.  All of this contributes to the mental and physical health and wellbeing of our people, which is the objective of the Healthy Ireland framework.<br/><br/>The increase in the number of SNAs to 11,000 is very welcome.  It is important that all children are taught in mainstream schools.  To do this successfully, we need suitably qualified people to help them.  We cannot expect principals and teachers to handle all of that.<br/><br/>The 50 cent increase on a pack of cigarettes is welcome.  I believe taxation can be used as an instrument for behavioural change.  An important element of the national cancer strategy and our tobacco strategy is a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.  People should avail of the opportunity to give up smoking as it is now a very expensive habit.  I plead with people not to take up smoking and I encourage those who do smoke but want to quit to avail of the many fantastic services available to them free of charge, including the HSE service <i>quit.ie.</i><br/><br/>I welcome the budget, although there are many other areas I would like to have seen addressed in it.  That said, it is a prudent budget and I support it.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the staff involved in preparing it.  I also acknowledge the role of Fianna F&aacute;il in the budget in terms of its advocation for certain elements and themes therein.</p></speech>

There are also some negatives, however, and some missed opportunities.  I will deal with this in a constructive rather than in a negative way so as to highlight the remaining issues and concerns that all of us meet on a daily basis in our constituencies and clinics.  I also want to acknowledge Fianna F&aacute;il's positive role and input in ensuring that fairness be applied in this budget and that it helps everyone across society, particularly those who are more vulnerable and more in need.  This role came about through the confidence and supply agreement and proved very important in both the 2017 and 2018 budgets.  I further acknowledge the work of my colleagues, Deputies Michael McGrath and Dara Calleary, in this regard.   When the electorate threw up the result that it did last year, matters were left very uncertain for some time.  Fianna F&aacute;il, however, did the responsible thing at the time in supporting and facilitating Fine Gael's minority-led Government rather than putting the reputation of the country at risk.  We were at a very vulnerable point at that stage and had just come through a very difficult period, so people both in Ireland and looking in from abroad needed to see maturity and common sense prevail.  It is very important that Fianna F&aacute;il's role in facilitating this minority-led Government be acknowledged positively.  We have been able to play a positive role and make a positive contribution both to this and to the last budget in the areas of concern to the people who gave us our mandate.   </p> <p> One area on which we must focus is the cost of living.  I will focus on two areas in this regard: motor insurance and variable mortgage interest rates.  There has been a missed opportunity here.  We need to be stronger in these areas so as to drive down the cost of living.  In driving down this cost we can help people and families, give them more money to spend, reduce the pressure and give them spending ability in their local communities which in turn helps the local, regional and national economy.  This is very important.  Motor insurance is, as we know, a huge issue and premiums have increased by 30%, 40% and 50%.  The recent figures from the CSO show a slight decrease but this has not been felt by many and certainly not at the scale that is needed.  It is important that we implement the recommendations from the joint Oireachtas committee so that premiums can remain static in the first instance and then be driven down.  CSO figures also show that insurance claims have collectively fallen in the last 18 months to two years, meaning that there is no real reason why premiums should be increasing at the rate that they are.  This is particularly true where individuals and families have had no change in their circumstances, be it with regard to a motor, home or business policy.  There is no justification for this.  It is wrong.  I spoke about it at the Committee of Public Accounts and I called for it to be investigated.  That investigation is ongoing.  It is fundamentally wrong to put people under pressure unnecessarily.  </p> <p> On the issue of the variable mortgage interest rates, I worked with my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, to bring forward a very good Bill which is now on Committee Stage.  The Bill looks to strengthen and give powers to the Central Bank to enforce and ensure that the commercial banks fall in line with the rest of Europe on this matter.  We are currently at interest rates which are 1.5% to 1.8% higher than the rest of Europe, which is completely unacceptable.  These rates result in a &euro;200,000 mortgage netting &euro;250 a month, money that could be back in people's pockets so as to give them a greater spend.  Bringing the areas of motor insurance and variable mortgage interest rates in line with where they should be would give the average family an extra &euro;300 a month, thus relieving a lot of pressure.  We need to focus on ensuring that we can actually deliver in these areas as this would bring immediate relief to the constant pressures stretching families at the moment.  </p> <p> Some &euro;4.3 billion has been announced for the capital investment plan for infrastructure.  Is this an announcement of a figure that has already been allocated and identified for projects?  I hear the same projects being mentioned again and that concerns me.  These are very worthy and necessary projects, such as the Sallins bypass in my own constituency, and many other examples.  I acknowledge that this is positive.  However, as this announcement has been made a number of times in 2017, I wonder whether this new funding will be going into projects already announced, or whether additional funding will be put into new projects.  This is of major importance if we are to develop and help all of our constituencies, and the country as a whole,  into the future.  </p> <p> We need to bring major capital investments in road infrastructure.  The N3, N4 and N5, for example, major roads connecting the north west with Dublin, need investment.  This will translate in turn into foreign direct investment, FDI, relocating into these areas thus moving companies out of Dublin, giving them other opportunities to bring employment into these areas and, importantly, helping those economies.  In delivering the road network we create employment and a feel-good factor.  It is also a matter of carrying out much-needed upgrade work.  We need to build on the excellent work done in the past on investing in our infrastructure.  This infrastructure has been left static for years now.  With borrowing currently at such a low level and interest rates at virtually 0%, we need to capitalise on the situation and invest in our road network so as to open up all of these areas to employment, industry, and tourism, which is also hugely important to the national economy.  We need to look at the situation critically and start serious investment in these areas.</p> <p> Public transport is also an issue.  Dublin is virtually a car-free zone because of the level of regulations and guidelines introduced to assist with public transport.  Public transport is being developed and used a lot more in my own constituency of Kildare North, provided the infrastructure is put in place.  The Dublin Bus route coming into from Dublin to Celbridge, Lexlip and Maynooth needs more capacity.  It is currently at full capacity, so much so that in the morning buses often have to pass by bus-stops without picking up passengers.  This area needs investment.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann routes 115 and 120 out to Kilcock and Clane are also at capacity and need further infrastructure and investment.  The trains on the Kilcock and on the Hazelhatch-Sallins lines are also at full capacity and need further investment to ensure that members of the public who want to use public transport can be facilitated in doing so, and do not have to turn up for services unable to cater for them. If we are serious about promoting public transport  then we must continue with aggressive investment to ensure that people are taken out of their cars and that there are services there for them to avail of.  The services are there but they need to be extended and expanded so as to offer greater capacity.  </p> <p> With regard to localised infrastructure, we are currently depending on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which comes under the Minister of State's own remit.  This is an excellent scheme and will open things up for all of the right reasons.  I have been getting feedback from local authorities, however, that the process from sign-off to actual delivery is extremely slow.  There are different reasons for this, from paperwork to the various phases that have to be worked through.  For these reasons, LIHAF might not deliver in the way it was expected to.  I am more than happy to engage with both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, on this matter, which I also raised with them last week.</p></speech>

It has a population of 22,000 and has needed a second bridge for the last 20 years.  I welcome the support I have received on this matter from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials.  The first phase of this process has commenced and this will eventually lead to a project going to tender to deliver a second bridge for Celbridge.  This is hugely important for the development of the town.  We need the funding to allow this to happen faster, however.  Clane, Maynooth and Naas all need ring roads, which would open up proper infrastructure and allow for future developments in a holistic way.  Again, however, the investment required here needs to be accelerated.  It looks like we are now depending on LIHAF to make the infrastructural improvements in those areas and many others around the country.  We need to move faster on this.  We need to look at what are the issues and how they can be overcome with a view to having projects delivered.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Dooley mentioned earlier, broadband is another serious issue that is not being addressed.</p><p>Broadband is now as important as electricity or a phone in one's home because people want to work from or are studying at home.  When children are at school and in college broadband is a necessity.  It is no longer a luxury.  We, therefore, need to accelerate the national broadband plan.  The information I have received in tabling parliamentary questions on areas in which the service needs to be upgraded is that the national broadband plan has still not been put out to tender.  That is a massive issue.  There are areas which are crying out for a service and which are being held back without it.  That is also very important.</p> <p> There are missed opportunities in the areas of health and social welfare.  While I welcome the increased investment in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, it is still not having an impact on waiting lists for the likes of adults who need spinal surgery, the waiting list for which stands at 38 months for a routine operation, and children who need orthopaedic treatment, the waiting list for which stands at two years for operations determined to be urgent.  The mental health service which was alluded to presents a major problem.  It needs to be resourced and funded properly.  </p> <p> I welcome the increase of &euro;5 in pensions and all other social welfare payments.  When the Social Welfare Bill is brought before the House, I will speak in detail to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, about the T&uacute;s scheme and the bereavement grant.  I called for the telephone allowance to be reinstated and I am delighted that measures have been taken in that regard.  The allowance is very important to people who are living on their own and in isolation.  They need the allowance not only to contact the outside world but also to be able to use panic alarms and panic buttons to ensure their security.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Frank O'Rourke, has referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the increases in social welfare payments and the additional funding for other specific areas.  I was glad when Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy referred to Glenisk.  I had some involvement with the company a number of years ago when I was in a position to allocate an additional milk quota before it was decided to abolish quotas in 2008.  I was glad to engage in discussions subsequently with its partners in the United States.  It is a very strong major international corporation.  Its pioneering role and that of so many other small companies in counties Offaly, Cavan and Meath, among others, is of huge importance to local economies.  Before I had become familiar with Glenisk, I remember former Deputy Brian Cowen speaking to me in glowing terms about its potential.  His comments swayed me to ensure some of the much sought after milk quota would be allocated to the company.</p>  <p>  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, is in the Chamber.  He may recall that, on a number of occasions at Question Time, I have raised with him and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government the issue of income eligibility limits for social housing.  I have highlighted the issue for him and the Ministers, Deputies Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy.  The limits applicable in Cavan-Monaghan are no longer tenable.  The Minister of State may recall that I highlighted the case of a young man who was an apprentice.  His partner who had, unfortunately, lost her job was in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  They had a child and were above the income limit to qualify for social housing.  I also highlighted the case of a young single mother who was rearing three children, two of whom were in primary school and one in second level education.  She was working in a low paid job and in receipt of family income supplement, yet she was above the income limit to qualify for social housing.  The fact that she was in receipt of family income supplement demonstrates that her income was not sustainable.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State's Department cannot continue to insist on a payment such as family income supplement being factored in in the assessment of income when someone is applying for local authority housing.  The people concerned have no hope of securing a mortgage from a mortgage provider, yet they do not qualify for social housing.  They are in no man's land.  On the day I raised this case the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, gave me a commitment that a review would be set in motion.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, then indicated to me - as I do not want to misrepresent him, I will paraphrase what he said - that a review had not taken place, or if it had, nothing had been done.  I appeal to the Minister of State that it is essential that income eligibility limits to qualify for social housing be revised.  I only know about the position my constituency, but they are much too low and need to be revised.  If they are not revised, we will deny a whole generation the opportunity to be tenants in a local authority house when they have no chance whatsoever of getting a mortgage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy also referred to Brexit.  I have the privilege to represent two Southern Ulster counties.  Here in the Oireachtas and also in our political work at home we are consumed by the issue of Brexit.  I have highlighted the fact that the economies of counties north and south of the Border, including Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and probably Armagh, are heavily dependent on three sectors - agrifood, construction products and engineering.  They are the three sectors which are most heavily dependent on Northern Ireland and Britain for their export markets and they have already been hit because of the weakness of sterling.  I appealed to the T&aacute;naiste to ensure there would be sector-specific responses to prepare companies to meet the further adverse impacts of Brexit when we reached 2019.  She said she would give the matter every possible consideration.  </p>  <p>  I have been appealing to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to prioritise meeting the infrastructure needs of the Border region.  I mention this to the Minister of State because, by their nature, the products being exported from the area in the three sectors mentioned have to be transported by heavy goods vehicles.  As a neightbour, the Minister of State will know that the road infrastructure in Cavan, Monaghan and some adjoining counties is not up to the standard we all wish to see.  The Government has the competence to decide where resources should be allocated for infrastructural development.  I speak to companies which export to Northern Ireland and Britain.  Thankfully, many of them are large, but they started off as small indigenous enterprises.  Some of them are now multinational corporations.  They speak to me about the additional costs incurred because of the poor road infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  We know that, for historical reasons, there was no investment in the Border region.  One of the key ingredients in ensuring there was no investment was the Troubles which were inflicted on the province of Ulster and adjoining areas for many decades.  Thankfully, particularly since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, many local companies have become all-Ireland companies.  They may have started in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh and Tyrone, but, thankfully, they have become cross-Border enterprises.  I think of food companies such as Lakeland Dairies and Lacpatrick.  Lakeland Dairies has three processing sites in the South and two in the North.  LacPatrick, formerly Town of Monaghan Co-op which had its headquarters in Monaghan town, has two processing plants north of the Border and one in County Monaghan.  These companies have raw material and finished product travelling north and south and to ports and airports.  They need local infrastructure to be upgraded if they are to have any chance of remaining competitive.  We know that there is a big competitive world out there and of the particular pressures caused by the weakness in sterling.  These sectors are very heavily dependant on the British market.  </p>  <p>  I am glad that the Minister for Justice and Equality will be in a position to increase recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Again, Brexit which is looming brings the concept of the Border back to us when we had thought it had gone from our psychology forever.  The Cavan-Monaghan Garda division covers a very long land border with the neighbouring jurisdiction.  There are very demanding policing requirements to be met in the Border area.  I have appealed to the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure, when the Garda Commissioner is allocating the additional Garda personnel throughout the country, the particular policing needs in the Cavan-Monaghan division will be given particular attention.  Unfortunately, since 2010 the number of garda&iacute; in Monaghan has been reduced by 28%.  The number of garda&iacute; in County Cavan has been reduced by 20%.  We will need to increase these numbers again because of the extra demands which will arise from Brexit.  Unfortunately, there has been a spate of crime in rural areas in both counties.  I have appealed to the Minister to ensure, when the additional Garda personnel become available, the particular policing needs in the Border region will be given the utmost priority.  We know that when criminals engage in misbehaviour in the Border region, they can get away very quickly into the neighbouring jurisdiction.</p><p>Unfortunately, the neighbouring areas north of the Border have historically been very lightly policed so I appeal for additional Garda numbers for the Cavan-Monaghan division.</p> <p> In the area of health, there is a problem in the Cavan-Monaghan area in respect of the provision of services to children with disabilities.  Not only are children not getting services, they are not even getting assessments prior to treatment.  I have appealed to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to ensure the particular needs of children with disabilities are prioritised within their allocation of resources for the HSE.  It is not acceptable that children have to wait exceptionally long times just for an assessment in respect of occupational therapy.</p></speech>

Everybody will agree that the way the banks have treated those on tracker mortgages is abominable, to say the least.  Despite the Taoiseach's sudden interest in this issue, it did not just happen today or yesterday but has happened for many, many years.  The last-minute attempts by the Government to threaten banks to fix it or face a levy will allow the banks and the Central Bank to get away with it without anybody being held accountable.  This scandal has happened on a continuous basis over many years.  Even after it was exposed and the banks were told to recompense customers, they slithered and slid away from what they were supposed to do legally, financially and morally.</p>  <p>  Since 2015 the Central Bank has conducted an industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage-related issues, including where banks wrongly denied customers their contractual right to return to a tracker rate of interest following a period on a fixed rate.  In February this year, eight months ago, the Central Bank confirmed that the total number of affected customers covered by this probe stood at a minimum of 13,000.  Some of them told their tale before the committee last week.  I do not know if the Minister has had a chance to hear it but it would stop him in his tracks to listen to the impact this has had on people's health, on that of their families, on their household incomes and on their ability to live their lives.</p>  <p>  Banks have caused enough stress in this country.  They brought the country to its knees and, given that experience, they should have woken up to their corporate responsibilities, their social responsibilities and their moral responsibilities.  Alas it seems, from the manner in which they are handling this issue, they have not.  One customer was being overcharged on their mortgage for over four years.  In May 2016 they were put on the correct rate by the bank but, 17 months on, the customer is still to be repaid the &euro;20,000 that was overcharged and the bank has yet to make an offer of redress or compensation.</p>  <p>  Given the severity of this and the impact it has had on families and homes, why is the Central Bank being so soft and so relaxed on banks, particularly the State-owned banks?  Why have the banks not been given an absolute deadline by which overcharged customers are to be repaid and compensated?  Can the Minister confirm whether the Government has any legislative plans for increased levies on banks as a result of this issue?  I am sure every party in this House will support an increased levy.  If there are any such plans, when will the legislation be introduced?</p></speech>

We have no truck with behaviour that brings people to the state of frustration and dismay we have seen.  The Taoiseach was very clear yesterday that any powers the Central Bank needs will be provided and that the Government will not be afraid to take other measures, including enhancing the bank levy which is set to raise &euro;750 million between now and 2021.  The Minister for Finance will call in the banks and will address the issues the Deputy has raised.  The Government takes this extremely seriously.</p>  <p>  Everybody hates someone who stands up in the D&aacute;il and says "I told you so" but when I was my party's spokesman on finance in 2004, when the Fianna F&aacute;il Government introduced the Central Bank Bill I said very clearly that it was a defective Bill.  It lacked the teeth for prudential regulation and consumer protection but that was the legislation that prevailed for much of the time this happened.  There are limitations in some of the current legislative machinery but the Government will not tolerate banks failing in their obligations to their customers and to those people who have been particularly affected by the tracker mortgage issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to say that, given the appalling trauma in our economy and our society caused by bad bank lending and poor regulation, there is now an absolute obligation on banks to fulfil their responsibilities to their clients.  The Central Bank and the Government should and will take this very seriously.</p></speech>

The Minister has been in Cabinet since 2011 so if the legislation was defective and weak he has had six and a half years to fix it, but he has not.  There seems to be no plan to do it, although there is a vague promise on the matter.  Today's <i>Irish Independent</i>features one customer, Garreth Murphy.  The decision on his tracker mortgage is costing him an extra &euro;500 per month, an extraordinary amount of money, but no remedy is being put on the table for him.  His is one of nearly 20,000 similar accounts.  At last week's committee meeting, one gentleman spoke of how he suffered a stroke and his wife suffered a nervous breakdown directly as a result of the stress caused to them.  We cannot stand by and make false promises on this issue.</p><p>Can the Minister outline the legislative framework?  The Taoiseach told us yesterday that the Minister for Finance would meet the banks next week to admonish them over their behaviour.  What did he mean by &quot;admonish&quot;?  The people affected do not need tea and sympathy but action, compensation and, most important, justice.</p></speech>

It has made clear that it is engaging with other statutory bodies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so there is no flinching from pursuing this.  Some of the failures occurred before the legislation giving new powers to the Central Bank came in and some of the defects were in the old legislation to which I referred.</p>  <p>  The Government will take any steps necessary, legally or by giving the Central Bank additional powers, but one cannot provide powers retrospectively as regards some of these events.  The Minister for Finance will be very clear as to the expectations of Government as regards bank behaviour.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in supported an amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice in an attempt to amend the Government's proposal, but Fianna F&aacute;il abstained when it was put to a vote and this measure therefore came into effect.  I know the Minister has read Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, which proposed to increase the rate of stamp duty on commercial property to 4%.  As the banking inquiry pointed out, commercial real estate was one of the major causes of the banking crash.  For that reason, it needs to be monitored and taxed appropriately and that is what we had in mind in our pre-budget submission.  It was never our intention to make life even more difficult for Irish farmers.</p></speech>

This would negate the original purpose of the Government's measure, which was to incentivise the early lifetime transfer of land to the next generation and to encourage young farmers to extend their holdings.  All this is being done now to cover up for the clear mistake the Government made in the budget.  The core issue is that at a time when farm incomes are half the average industrial wage and many farm enterprises are not viable without being expanded, the Government is proposing to triple the level of stamp duty imposed on farmers who are trying to make their holdings viable.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Creed, told us in his post-budget press conference that this increase would not apply to farmland.  He said he wanted to "nail this one" and was adamant that "the increase in stamp duty [would] not apply to agricultural land".  Did the Minister or his advisers not know what the Minister for Finance was proposing, or did they get it wrong?  Fine Gael portrays itself as the farmers' party and has always had that tradition.  However, the disregard for rural Ireland in the current Cabinet is so severe that this measure was introduced without any consideration of its consequences for the farming community and without any consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  At a time of low incomes and Brexit pressures, when reduced Common Agricultural Policy payments are coming down the road, is the Government happy to stand over a threefold increase in the level of stamp duty imposed on a farmer who wishes to extend his or her holding to make it viable?</p></speech>

The Deputy has shown some understanding of this.  We have a strong commercial sector, but our housing sector is not meeting the needs of the people.  Our intention in introducing this measure is to secure a switch in activity to the housing area, where it is badly needed.  The Minister has provided for a relief that will apply to any sale of farmland that is then used for residential purposes.  He has also provided for capital gains tax measures and for a new fund that will support developers to develop land for housing.  This is part of a group of measures, the aim of which is to deliver one of the most important needs of our people.  The position in relation to stamp duty on commercial property, which includes certain categories of farmland, is that there will be an increase to the new 6% rate.  It is not going back to the 9% rate that prevailed in the past.  There are very significant exemptions, as the Deputy knows.  There are exemptions for young farmers, for transfers within families when holdings are being consolidated and for sales that result in the land being used for housing purposes within a specified 30-month period.  These significant concessions will ensure genuine farmers who are trying to transfer to the new generation and young farmers who are entering farming are protected.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has rightly said, the finance Bill will include additional provisions to deal with some anomalies in the system, such as the provision that means people over a certain age face a higher level of stamp duty.  A period of time will be given to allow such transfers to occur.  The Deputy has also rightly mentioned that in the longer term we want to see earlier transfers.  This measure will be reviewed after a certain period to ensure our intention, which is to encourage earlier transfer, is remaining an important part of our approach to farmland.  I cannot speak for Sinn F&eacute;in's intentions in submitting its proposals.  I did not see any such exemption outlined in its document.  I am not accountable for Sinn F&eacute;in's intentions.  Sinn F&eacute;in rightly pointed out in its pre-budget submission that this is a justifiable measure.  It is now being introduced.  I think reasonable reliefs are being put in place to ensure it does not have unintended consequences for the sorts of farming transfers we want to see happen.</p></speech>

We all know farmers around the country with small pieces of land who are working very hard and struggling to survive and raise their families.  The only way forward for them is to expand when land comes up for sale beside their farms.  Many of them cannot get the money from the bank to extend their holdings in such circumstances.  The issue here is the decision to increase the level of stamp duty imposed on such transactions from 2% to 6%.  I acknowledge that this change will not apply to young farmers under the age of 35 who have green certs.  Many farmers are not in that category, particularly in the dairy industry where farmers are expanding significantly.  They will not get any exemption because they are over the age of 35.  It is clear that this measure was not thought through.  When it was introducing it, the Government did not realise that farmers were going to be caught.  Now that it has realised that, and the backlash is under way, it is attempting to do something about it.  Clearly, its attempts are not enough because they are not dealing specifically with struggling farmers who want to expand their holdings.  That is the problem we need to sort out.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to do something in the upcoming finance Bill to ensure the 6% provision does not extend to farmers in this position.</p></speech>

If the owner of a small business involved in some other activity wished to expand his or her business, it would be quite unjust if he or she were subject to a different tax regime from a farmer with a small holding who wished to expand.</p></speech>

It was an imitation of a pledge made by his good friend, Justin Trudeau.  It created great hope and expectation across the arts community.  Unlike his Canadian friend, the Taoiseach did not follow through on what he had said with a serious commitment in the budget.  The chair of the Arts Council has described next year's allocation to the arts as a "huge disappointment".  If the rate of increase set out in the budget is continued with, it will take another 21 years to achieve the Taoiseach's commitment to the arts.  There is great uncertainty among the arts community at the moment.  The National Campaign for the Arts has expressed concern about the focus in the Creative Ireland programme on publicity and marketing rather than long-term and sustainable policy change and investment.</p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published a draft national cultural framework policy, known as Culture 2025.  It horrified campaigners in the arts.  After much pressure in this House - I raised the matter on Leaders' Questions - the then Taoiseach agreed to refer the framework policy to an Oireachtas committee before it was finalised.  When the committee published its report in July of this year, it included 42 recommendations aimed at bringing about a shift in the Government's approach to arts and culture.  As the all-party committee noted, "A policy without a clear definition of its objective is blind, a policy without legislation is discretionary and a policy without the necessary resources .... is paralysed."  It is unclear whether the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, intends to pay any attention to the committee's report or to plough ahead with the initial framework she published last year.</p><p>We have no clear definition of objectives and no underpinning legislation and I see none is planned in the legislative programme.  We have no commitment to provide the required funding for its implementation.  Does the Minister accept that the paltry increase in funding for the Arts Council was already committed to and that, therefore, in real terms, it is not additional money?  Will he give a renewed commitment to double the funding for the sector over a five-year period?  Will he give us a sense of when we can expect to receive a final version of Culture 2025 and indicate whether the recommendations of the committee in that regard will be heeded?</p></speech>

It is an area in which the Government is very ambitious and, of course, it will take time to realise those ambitions.  The publication of the Creative Ireland programme was a milestone.  One of the lessons drawn from the very successful 1916 Rising celebrations was that we could celebrate and use our cultural heritage as a significant asset for the people.  In that regard, I am very pleased that we are starting in the education area.  With the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, we will start the Creative Children initiative this year, for which we have set aside money in the budget.  The Minister has also set out an ambitious capital programme for the arts and culture this year which will be enhanced in the ten-year capital programme soon to be announced.</p></speech>

On a year to year basis, as the Deputy knows, this has been a very difficult financial year.  We did not have significant sums of money available to us.  Nonetheless, the allocation to the Arts Council was increased by &euro;9 million, while funding for the Irish Film Board was increased by 9%.  Significant initiatives are being taken across the arts.  The ambition of the Taoiseach is that we should develop along the line of strategies, in particular the Creative Ireland concept, whereby we view the arts as an important asset for the people and a major part of the way in which young people are educated.  There is a commitment to the arts which has been matched on the capital side and, in so far as is possible, the current side.  It will be backed up by the ten-year capital programme for which I know the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has very ambitious plans.</p></speech>

There is no getting around the fact that the commitment to double funding over a set period raised expectations among the arts community which were dashed when no additional real money was allocated to the Arts Council.  If the Government is serious about this, it should not make commitments and then state there are particular constraints in a given year.  It should set out in clear terms the timescale over which arts funding is to be doubled.  When will the 2020 vision for the arts be debated in the House?  Will the recommendations of the all-party committee be reflected in the revised document?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the Creative Ireland programme, the context for development in this area over a number of years, sets out very significant ambitions which will be reflected in the capital programme.  They include the ambition to support new art centres, theatres, galleries, museums and heritage centres, the sort of thing which can make a difference in the use and enjoyment of our cultural heritage.  That is very much part of the Government's plan.  To be fair, since 2014 the budget for the Arts Council has increased by 20%.  I have no doubt that it uses the money extremely well to leverage activities, festivals, bursaries and so on across the artistic community.  As to when we will make money available, the Taoiseach's ambition for the arts and culture sector will be a major feature of decisions made in future budgets.</p></speech>

Coincidentally, the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport was cancelled this week.  We were due to hear from representatives of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, but for the second time the meeting was cancelled.  There are different arguments as to the reasons for the cancellations.  There was some very important evidence to be given by Ryanair pilots to the committee.  I know that the media are worried about covering this issue because a lot of advertising revenue is generated by Ryanair, but it is a very serious issue in terms of the level of public interest.  We are compromised on the question of aviation safety in this country because of the relationship between the IAA and the airlines it is supposed to regulate.</p>  <p>  Given that 700,000 passengers recently faced disruption due to the cancellation of Ryanair flights, the light thrown on the airline's activities in respect of health and safety and the irregular working hours and conditions of pilots, does the Minister think it is important that pilots address the joint committee?  Should the outcome of whatever discussions the Commissioner has with the IAA today be made public in the House?  </p>  <p>  I have very serious and genuine concerns about the protection of the public interest.  I am not trying to stir things up, but we need to listen carefully to what the pilots have to say and what they are saying about the regulatory authorities.  The chief concern is that the IAA, unlike all other authorities regulating aviation across Europe, was set up on a commercial for-profit basis.  It collect charges and other revenue from the very airlines it regulates.  It collects most of its revenue from Ryanair.  To give an idea of the amount of money involved, last year the IAA made a profit of almost &euro;40 million.  Its CEO, Mr. Eamonn Brennan, receives a salary of &euro;344,000 a year.  The IAA regulates the safety of the airlines from which it is making money.  There is a toxic relationship between the regulatory authority which looks after air safety and the means by which it collects its revenue.  As I said, such an arrangement is illegal in many European countries and there are significant implications for the working conditions of the pilots concerned, an issue I will discuss.  Is the Minister aware of this relationship?  Does he think it compromises the safety of civil aviation in this country?  Does he think it is acceptable that the IAA has been established on a profit-making basis which allows it to have what could, at best, be described as a dysfunctional relationship with the airlines it regulates?</p></speech>

I have no control over the agenda set by the committee.</p>  <p>  No doubt there are many issues of concern, not least about what will happen following Brexit and the impact it might have, as well as the safety of passengers.  It is my understanding Ryanair flights were disrupted because the safety of passengers was the priority, rather than the commercial interests of the company which were not served by the decisions taken.  The company had to put up its hand and admit to its failings.  That is an example of regulation working.</p>  <p>  On the question of whether regulators in general should be funded by levies imposed on the industries they regulate, it is common practice in the case of most regulatory bodies.  The reason for it is that while regulation is important, the general taxpayer should not pay when the industry should pay by way of registration fees for the oversight of services a regulator provides.  It is important to the reputation of the industr, which is very clearly set out in the legislation. </p>  <p>  The source of the payments in no way compromises the authority's primary commitment to safety.  It is accountable to this House and others for how it executes its mandate.  It can be called to account at any stage.  The use of levies, whether in banking or other regulated sectors, to meet the cost of regulation is a common practice across all jurisdictions.</p><p>We have used the model in most of our regulator activities.  It has never been shown to compromise in any way the exercise of the statutory obligations of these authorities.</p></speech>

It is possible to separate the authorities that collect revenue from airlines through the taxation system, for example, and the authority that regulates how the airlines operate.  This goes to a bigger issue.  The Minister states the safety of passengers was at the heart of the cancellations but that is not the case.  Pilots are exiting Ryanair in their hundreds because there is a global shortage and the structures used by Ryanair to establish the employment of pilots is illegal elsewhere in Europe.  It is highly irregular and is being investigated by two revenue groups in Britain and Germany.  The governments in Britain and Germany are investigating pilots who live there for potential tax fraud.  Imagine the stress this would put on pilots.  There is a complex reason for this as the pilots are forced to be self-employed and their work is traded between various companies.  Those companies and the pilots are being investigated.  The pilots are also being pressurised to cut down on the use of fuel.  It was denied that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport discussed that with the Irish Aviation Authority.  This is a can of worms and a dirty game.  Somebody is keeping quiet about many injustices and there is much money being made.  What the Minister says is not true.  This is highly irregular.</p></speech>

Power restoration means the numbers without public water are down to 25,000.  The number affected by electricity outages is down to 75,000.  As Mr. Sean Hogan stated on the radio this morning, the process is now becoming more difficult and time-consuming as we are getting to individual items.  The Defence Forces have been out to assist and we have called in resources from many overseas jurisdictions to assist in restoring services as rapidly as possibly.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, before coming here and there is an acute understanding of the threat in Cork from potential flooding.  There is very close monitoring with the local authorities of those events.  The emergency committee is still actively engaged in ensuring we maximise our protection and be prepared for all eventualities.  That work is continuing and there is a new focus on the particular incidence of potential storm Brian, which is approaching us.

One of the pertinent matters for most people living in rural Ireland, even in the context of the recent storm, is the ambulance service.  This service in many parts of rural Ireland cannot possibly even dream of reaching the target of 19 minutes to get to any incident.  Lightfoot Solutions did a report in 2014 and the recommendations were never implemented.  One of the key recommendations was to train more paramedics, provide more vehicles and revamp the management structure.  When will this be done?  When can people living in rural Ireland expect that when they call an ambulance, it will be there if not within 19 minutes then even within 40 minutes?  That would be a magnificent for many people living in rural Ireland.  Will the Minister ensure this happens?</p></speech>

Arising from that commitment, we now have four consortia of institutes of technology seeking university status.  The legislation to allow for that reached Committee Stage in January 2016.  I know some time was spent ironing out an agreement with trade unions on this matter, which I welcome, but we have still not had publication of the Committee Stage amendments.

When the Social Welfare Bill was passed last year, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith had sought an amendment seeking a report on the inequalities faced by pensioners, which we have discussed this week.  That affects 35,000 pensioners who are being robbed of a full pension entitlement.  At the time, the current Taoiseach and then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, included an amendment indicating a report on those anomalies would be done within six months.  Deputy Smith had sought three months as the timeframe.  We are well past the period as stipulated in last year's Bill but we still have procrastination from the Government.  There are many excuses about how complicated it is but where is the report?  When will we get it?  This has gone on and on while tens of thousands of pensioners are being robbed of their full pension entitlement because of a failure by the Government to honour the promise.</p></speech>

We all want the information sought by the Deputy in his question.  My Department started last week to compile the relevant information with regard to the women, in the main, and men - they are 40% of the cohort - who are particularly disadvantaged as a result of changes in bands because of their average length in working life.  It will take us a couple of weeks to do this as the records before 1994 are all paper-based.  We need to go through each one of them individually.  I guarantee the Deputy, as I did in my speech last night, that as soon as the process is finished in a matter of weeks, I will bring this back to the D&aacute;il.

What is going on in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority, RSA?  Yesterday the stakeholders, including all the farming bodies and agricultural contractors of Ireland, were told out of the blue that the RSA is implementing a new policy whereby any tractor at 40k or above that cannot travel more than 25 km/h.  This is effectively blindfolding and is hugely damaging to agriculture.  Indeed, fodder is being transported to the west because of the storms.  This came out of the blue, without consultation.  I want a moratorium placed on this, because it is going to have a huge impact.  It will force older tractors with a lower speeds, which are totally unsuitable, onto the roads.  It is madness.  The RSA has to be reigned in because it is totally out of touch and is trying to destroy rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Listening to the turmoil experienced by Siobh&aacute;n Phillips and her parents, Sean and Bronagh, in their reporting to the Garda station in the 24 hours prior to the murder of Garda Tony Golden, highlights the need for a proper protocol to be introduced immediately in order to minimise the chances of a repeat of such an event, especially where the victims of families feel under threat.  It should be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

It will fall to the new Government and the Oireachtas to agree the first statutory nation low-carbon transition-mitigation plan".  The mitigation plan falls way short.  We have international targets that we have to meet by 2020, including a reduction of 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.  The Environmental Protection Agency has said in the last few weeks that the best case scenario is that we will achieve 4% to 6%.  There was an all-day Cabinet session which met to discuss this issue recently.  We have seen the events in Donegal, on the Inishowen peninsula, in August.  We have seen the events earlier this week throughout the country.  It was felt in County Laois.  We have also seen the effects of global warming.  The national mitigation plan falls short.  It is an aspirational document.  We have highlighted this repeatedly.  There are no binding sectoral targets.  We are facing increased global warming and also fines in the order of &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million per year from the European Union.  We need to start putting that money into mitigation and not into fines.  Does the Government intend to revise that plan in the light of the new developments?</p></speech>

It is ongoing, and there is an opportunity for everyone to become involved.  We recognise, as the Deputy does, that this will require a major cultural change in our attitude to some parts of our activity.  As a first measure there were significant announcements in the budget concerning building insulation, energy efficiency and the use of electrical vehicles.  The Minister is making significant changes this year, but there is no doubt that the national consultation will require us, over the coming years, to very considerably step up our effort in this area.</p></speech>

There could not be more effort being put into restoring power at the moment, but as Se&aacute;n Hogan indicated this morning, some of these breakages involving going to each pole and identifying the fault.  That can take greater time, and that is one of the constraints that people are working under.

A request went to the Minister from the ETB in May, at the initiation of my colleague, Councillor Rena Donaghey, seeking a meeting to try and establish and prioritise the purchasing of a site to progress that three school campus.  The ETB is still awaiting a response and a meeting with the Minister.

Sligo has probably lead the field in that the Sligo Institute of Technology introduced an online delivery of apprenticeships for people working in the insurance sector.  It shows what can be done in the area of apprenticeships.  It is a level 8 apprenticeship.  We are on track to achieve those targets.  There will be 1,400 additional apprenticeships this year, and that will match an increase from last year.  There have been 77 new applications for new apprenticeships.  We will role out another 13 this year.  There has been real progress in this area, which commands support right across the House.  The development of apprenticeships as an alternative for many people is far more developed in other countries than in our own.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900031#FF01000"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased, on behalf of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to introduce the National Archives (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important cultural institutions and plays an essential part in the cultural life of the country by collecting, managing and preserving the public records of Ireland.  The records held by the National Archives document the historical evolution of the State and the creation of our national identity.  The archives are key to informing Government policy and assisting research into the political, economic and social forces which have shaped the nation.  The purpose of the Bill is to reduce the time limit for the deposit of certain departmental records with the National Archives from 30 years to 20.  As Members may be aware, the British and Northern Irish archives have moved to a 20-year rule for the transfer of records to the British Archives and the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland.  However, in Ireland the statutory period for transfer of departmental records remains 30 years.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of synchronising the release of certain records between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, particularly those records relating to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish issues.  The proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if the relevant Minister, that is, Deputy Heather Humphreys, as Minister with responsibility for the National Archives, agrees that the early release of the records in question is warranted by virtue of their historical or public interest value or to facilitate fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions.</p><p>The Minister is conscious of the fact that the proposals will have resource implications for Departments and changes will have to be managed within constrained budgetary allocations.  For this reason, the changes will be implemented on a phased basis, starting with those Departments which holding significant numbers of Anglo-Irish and North-South records, namely, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General.  The intention is to move over time to a full 20-year rule for all Departments, as resources permit.</p><p>  A phased implementation approach will assist in dealing with the inevitable resource implications for Departments, while providing flexibility for the early release of records, where appropriate.  To facilitate progress in dealing with this issue, the director of the National Archives is chairing an implementation group which is developing an implementation plan which will be finalised shortly.  As part of the process of implementing the 20-year rule, the director of the National Archives will write to all Departments to ascertain the number of files over 30 years old being stored by Departments, offices and the courts and the cost of so doing.</p><p>It is clear if the need for offsite storage was reduced, savings could be made across the entire system.</p> <p> As I stated, the National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important cultural institutions, housing some of our most important historical State records.  The Minister is only too aware of the limited physical capacity that the National Archives has to store our archives.  However, there are exciting developments ahead for the National Archives in that regard.  The Minister was delighted that as part of the decade of centenary commemorations, the Government provided &euro;8 million in funding to commence the National Archives redevelopment plans.  As the centenary of the destruction of the Public Records Office approaches in 2022, the new National Archives building, which will house the State archives, will be an appropriate response to the loss of so much of our cultural heritage in that destructive fire in 1922.  The Office of Public Works has appointed a design team and is working with the National Archives to finalise the design plans for the Bishop Street building.</p> <p> The lack of a records management policy is also an issue when it comes to the accumulation of records in Departments.  The Minister is very pleased to have been in a position to provide the National Archives with &euro;150,000 in 2016 and &euro;300,000 in 2017 to assist in the work the office is doing on a public sector records management policy in conjunction with the office of the Government&rsquo;s chief information officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This policy aims to provide universal guidelines for the public sector in the management of records and, in particular, digital material.  Crucially, it will also scope out the requirements of the National Archives in starting to accept digital records from Departments and the task of making digital records available to the public.</p> <p> I will now turn specifically to the Bill and its main provisions.  Sections 1 and 2 deal with general provisions such as definitions of words and terms in the Bill.  </p> <p> Section 3 amends the National Archives Act 1986 by inserting a definition for "relevant records", or those records to which the National Archives (Amendment) Bill 2017 applies in order to provide for early release of a particular class or classes of departmental records.  </p> <p> Section 4 provides the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the power by order to have records transferred to the National Archives from a Department after 20 years rather than the current 30-year transfer limit.  An order will only be made under this section once the Minister has approval of the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the relevant Minister to whose Department the order will apply.  It will also come after consultation with the director of the National Archives.</p> <p> Section 4 also provides the policy and principles under which the Minister would make such an order.  These are if the records concerned are of significant historical or public interest such as to warrant their transfer to the National Archives; the transfer of the records concerned to the National Archives will facilitate the balanced and fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions; and the arrangements for such transfer are adequate.  </p> <p> Section 4 also provides that the Minister may make an order where he or she is satisfied the arrangements for the transfer of all departmental records more than 20 years old to the National Archives are adequate.  This will remove the need for further legislation in the event that the Government decides to move to a 20-year rule for all Departments at some point in the future.  Section 4 also provides that if a Department had already transferred records between 20 and 30 years of age to the National Archives, it will not be required to do so again.</p> <p> Sections 4 and 5 also provide for the amendment of section 8 of the National Archives Act 1986 to insert the term "relevant records" where necessary.  Section 5 also provides for the deletion of section 10(6) of the National Archives Act 1986 as this section is no longer necessary.  </p> <p> Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 11 of the National Archives Act 1986 to insert the term "relevant records" where necessary.  Section 7 provides for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.</p> <p> Given our shared history with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the Minister believes it is important that the synchronised release of official records should, to the greatest extent possible, be restored where appropriate.  The Minister is satisfied the Bill provides the flexibility to do so when a record set is of sufficient historical or public interest value.  I am pleased to bring the Bill before the D&aacute;il and I look forward to hearing the contributions from Deputies throughout Second Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The National Archives is very important for the heritage and history of this country.  Our heritage officers on councils play a pivotal role in the protection and promotion of what we have to offer in this country, with our national institutions such as the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland which have so many fantastic displays.  We are delighted to see so many developments in these national institutions.</p>  <p>  Heritage officers play a major role within local authorities in the protection of our culture and heritage, as well as the archives within our local libraries and authorities.  They do this from an education perspective and programmes are run in collaboration with other sectors in local authorities, including libraries and arts offices.  The "Golden Mile" is a particular scheme being rolled out by heritage officers and I have observed it as being very successful across the country in promoting and protecting our natural and architectural heritage.  In the past we may have been less aware of this so it is very important that it is promoted within our schools and at a local and national level.  That is happening now with heritage officers doing terrific work during heritage week, which will see major promotion of those historic ventures around the country.  We are happy to the support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900032#GG00300"><p>Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the functioning of a democracy and the release of state papers is a valuable mechanism whereby we can scrutinise decisions made behind closed doors.  They offer a valuable insight into the shaping of the State's predominant political narrative.  The importance of transparency came to light a number of weeks ago when 14 years of footage of Oireachtas debates up to 2014 were removed from the Oireachtas website.  I am thankful that footage has been restored to the web after public outcry.  This demonstrates the importance of the public having access to these records.</p>  <p>  I welcome the move to reduce the period after which these documents can be released from 30 years to 20.  I have a few misgivings which I will outline, but this is a progressive act that will see the eventual alignment of the release of Irish State papers with those of Britain.  The British Government began its move towards releasing records after 20 years in 2013, and it will release records in batches covering two years each year until 2022, when the gap will be narrowed from 30 years to 20.  The Bill intends to operate broadly along the same lines but it will have to catch up on five years in order to attain parity in the release dates.  Currently, the difference between the two countries is problematic, particularly in the area of Anglo-Irish relations.  With the earlier release of British state papers, we will only get one side of the story and a distorted view of history.  In the next five years, for example, documents pertaining to the Good Friday Agreement will be released in Britain, but they will not be released here for another ten years.  Naturally, Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the need to speed up the release of documents from the Irish Government so as to add a full and more balanced outcome.  However, the delay in releasing our documents will be a problem.</p>  <p>  In future debates on the Bill I would like the Minister to elaborate on what is deemed to be a "relevant record".  There seems to be much additional power given to the Minister in the Bill as to determine what is of significant historical and public interest.  Could this ever be ascertained in an objective manner?  I fear political motives could obscure the truth in this regard and items of major historical importance could be simply locked away in order to save the blushes, or worse, of a former political colleague, for example.  There are other details within the Bill about which I have reservations, and these will be scrutinised in further detail on Committee Stage.  I will summarise them.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will have the power to amend or revoke an order designating records to be "relevant records".  What are the criteria in making this decision?  As the Bill does not refer to the existing scheduled bodies, will they now be beyond the scope of the legislation?  What will happen to these records?</p><p> The transfer of records to the National Archives will be made by ministerial order following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  This reduces the power of the director to appraise records and decide whether they should be retained or disposed of.  We have concerns about this.  The Bill includes a provision to transfer by ministerial order records which are less than 30 years old but more than 20 years old which will then have to be voted on by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This provision has the potential to politicise the designation and transfer of public records.  There is no set date in the Bill for the transfer of records.  When will this occur and on what basis will it occur?  The Bill states the transfer of records will occur when arrangements for the transfer of all departmental records are in place for items that are more than 20 years old and when the National Archives are adequate.  What is meant by "adequate" and who will make these decisions?  The Bill states a decision to review the status of closed records or records that are not deemed to be relevant, subject to transfer, will be made.  Will the Minister state precisely when that might occur?  Will there be sanctions against Departments if they do not transfer records?  </p> <p> I am hugely concerned about capacity issues in the transfer of records.  They could be a hindrance to the objectives of the Bill.  Many Departments are struggling to meet the 30 year rule; therefore, without additional resources the execution of the Bill will be impossible.  The Government has implemented devastating cuts to the Arts and Heritage Bill and there was no additional provision in the recent budget for the resourcing of the National Archives, although we are yet to see the Estimates.  However, this is an indication that the National Archives are going to be denied the funding required to implement the measures outlined in the Bill.  </p> <p> Even though the Bill seeks to bring about greater transparency, the irony is that it is the concept of Government accountability at its worst.  The Minister says the vaults of the National Archives will be opened up in the interests of the people of Ireland, but, in reality, what is actually going to be unleashed is more boxes to understaffed Departments and under-resourced areas.  They cannot handle the paperwork they have to do now, yet the Minister wants to double it in the next few years.  Unless the Minister and the Minister of State are willing to provide the necessary resources, this is a pointless exercise.  It must not amount to the passing of laws which will lead to standards that cannot be maintained.  If the Minister was serious about this, she would put money into the National Archives.  I appreciate that &euro;8 million is to be put towards the development of a building which will house the archives, but this is a capital investment in necessary infrastructure and is not related to providing the increased manpower necessary to honour the aims of the Bill.  </p> <p> The problems which arise are not just to do with storage.  They are also to do with the preservation and documentation of our past.  This is done by allowing people to access the documents of the past.  The National Archives is open from 9.15 a.m. to 5 p.m.  For most people working normal hours, the documents are literally inaccessible to them.  Furthermore, few of them are digitised.  If people cannot gain access to them, it creates massive problems for local historians and the type of person who undertakes the research that actually shines a light on our past.  Access to our history allows us to lift the lid on the secretive, closed culture of the State.  We support the passing of legislation that opens the archives, but we entreat the Government to provide the necessary funding to enable people to access them.  The National Archives can only function if what is stored therein can be accessed easily.  If the files cannot be obtained easily owing to a lack of resources, it is the worst type of gesture politics.  </p> <p> Is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn agus don Rialtas taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo agus cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh acmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; ag an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900033#HH00200"><p>Decisions we make today can have implications for how our history will be told into the future.  How that will manifest itself is unpredictable.  Many records are now held digitally and have been for the past 20 years or so.  As the formats in which records are held sometimes become obsolete, we are faced with many additional challenges that we have to overcome.</p>  <p>  I will reiterate some of the points made by the previous speaker about some aspects of the Bill.  In section 2 the term "relevant records" is introduced.  "Relevant records" are defined as records more than 20 years old but less than 30 years old where an order has been made.  Other than that, it does not give a clear definition of what the records are.  That is very important.  Section 2 of the 1986 Act states all of the different formats in which departmental records can be kept and that will remain.  However, there is no clear direction as to who will decide what is a relevant record, aside from it being 20 years old as opposed to 30.  The current legislation is easy to implement as it encompasses all records created, regardless of age.  They are transferred to the National Archives when they are 30 years old.  Relevant records are a subset of departmental records as defined under 1986 Act..  </p>  <p>  The Bill does not refer to the existing scheduled bodies.  Does this mean that they are outside the scope of the legislation?  What will happen to their records?  Is the Government relying on the 1986 Act in that regard?  Will that Act be superceded?</p>  <p>  The transfer of records to the National Archives will be made by ministerial order following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  This removes the power of the director to appraise records and decide whether they should be retained or disposed of.  There are many records and it is a question of a good archivist being able to decide which ones are relevant.  Directors are civil servants and should have no political allegiances or agendas.  They should make impartial appraisal decisions based on the evidence provided for them.  In making this change we are potentially politicising access to public records which would be contrary to the spirit of openness and transparency.  The Minister will now have the power to make an order for transfer if records are of significant historical or public interest to warrant their transfer.  Who will decide what records are of significant historical or public interest?  Who will advise the Minister in making that decision?  </p>  <p>  The Government currently does not get involved in the selection or appraisal of records for transfer.  That work is carried out by civil servants who carry out their obligations under the 30 year rule as set out in the 1986 Act.  There is a danger that selective appraisal will take place based on individual interests or bias.  That is quite dangerous.  The same clause states: "The transfer of the records concerned to the National Archives will facilitate the balanced and fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions".</p><p>That is a clear statement that the 20 year rule is to facilitate the release of records relating to Northern Ireland to balance out the release of information from the United Kingdom.  The Bill includes the provision that transfers of records less than 30 years old, but more than 20 years old, by ministerial order will have to be voted on by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This has the potential to politicise the designation and transfer of public records.  These are serious issues for the future.  </p> <p> There is no set date in the Bill for the transfer of records.  The 30 year rule automatically means all 30 year old records have to be transferred, if records over 20 years old are not put forward for appraisal, when will they be transferred to the National Archives?  The Bill states the transfer of records will occur when "arrangements for the transfer of all Departmental records which are more than 20 years old to the National Archives are adequate."  There is major work going on in the building.  I have looked for that for a long time and welcomed its announcement.  I have been there to see how it is proceeding.  It is a big warehouse.  The last time I asked about cataloguing of records there were approximately 70,000 boxes that were not catalogued.  That was a few years ago.  There will always be a challenge in that respect.  It could mean that older records are put even further back.  It is all very well saying we have them but getting them and being able to select the ones we want to look at is very challenging when they are not catalogued.  What does the Bill mean by "adequate"?  Who makes the assessment and judgment that the situation is "adequate" and the transfer can take place?</p> <p> The Bill does state the decision to review the status of closed records, or records which are not deemed "relevant records" and subject to transfer, will take place but it does not say when.  The current legislation states this review will happen every five years.</p> <p> Section 10(6) of the 1986 Act which allows a Minister to transfer records less than 30 years old is being removed.  The existence of this clause would allow a 20 year rule to be implemented without changing the current Act.  Is this section being removed so that individual Ministers cannot take decisions which would conflict with those of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?  The Taoiseach will have the power to amend or revoke an order designating records as "relevant records", but no criteria for this decision are given.  That needs to happen.</p> <p> Reading the Bill it appears that there will be no sanctions against Departments if they do not transfer records.  While no sanctions are currently imposed on Departments or agencies of State if they have not transferred records more than 30 years old, they are aware that they are in breach of the legislation and can face public criticism for this.  There is an expectation that 30 year old records are transferred.  We should hear something from the Minister on that issue.  We believe the current drafting of the Bill introduces uncertainty into many of the functions carried out by the National Archives at present and leaves open the possibility of the politicisation of decisions in the selection of records for permanent preservation. </p> <p> If we spend money now, we can save later.  If there are enough people in the National Archives who can whittle down the records to the key ones that are appropriate to retain, we would reduce storage costs and the cost of digitisation.  It would make a lot of sense to invest in staff for cataloguing.  There are probably more than 70,000 boxes that have not been catalogued. </p> <p> Catriona Crowe, the former director of the National Archives, is speaking on this issue in Maynooth tonight.  She wants to open the administrative records of the mother and baby homes, industrial schools and Magdalen laundries for journalists and scholars.  The records can be anonymised when digitised and only people who need to see the individual record or have a personal interest in it can see it.  We all know people struggling to find material on themselves.  That should be taken on board as a matter of goodwill.  The historical adoption records held by Tusla need to be digitised and catalogued as a matter of urgency.  They are very personal and it has to be made simpler for people to find records.</p> <p> I was in the National Archives recently.  The work has some way to go to conclude.  When we compare them with the new Public Record Office of Northern Ireland or the National Archives (Public Records Office) in Kew in England, we realise the risk we have taken until now with the records held by the State.  That work cannot happen quickly enough because the records are at risk of damage by fire or water.  It is important that work is moving towards its conclusion.  There should be no spoiling the ship for a ha'pworth of tar.  We must make sure the records in the National Archives are protected from fire and water.</p></speech>

I welcome the interlinking of databases and the digitisation of the records.  As a pastime I spend a great deal of time looking at these archives.</p><p>I met a Member of the Welsh Assembly last week and when he told me where his grandfather had come from, I was able to find the 1901 and the 1911 censuses and other items within two minutes.  It is very important to protect whatever archives we have, but also to increase our expenditure on the National Library of Ireland and the county libraries which do a fantastic job.  Other archives are important such as the records of baptisms in the Catholic Church.  My people came from County Kerry and I can get church archives dating back to 1828-29.  They are photocopies rather than digital, but it is amazing what one can find out.  They are very useful.  One of the biggest growth industries in Ireland and the world is <i>www.ancestry.com </i>.</p><p>Somebody from my street is married to one of its senior executives, but I will not mention their name and embarrass them.  I refer to the reach of the website, the work it has and how it has reunited people from a nation who have emigrated far and wide but particularly to the United Kingdom and America.  The American records are particularly good.  In fact, I traced a relation of mine from whom nobody had heard since they emigrated in 1914.  We were able to trace them, where they lived, including the different addresses, and what they did.  The American archives are really remarkable.<br/><br/>In terms of education, local history topics are hugely important such as the place one lives, as are photographs of one's family, including photographs of one's grandparents and great-grandparents.  We all like to look at the Lawrence collection of photographs and other photographs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  I am not a researcher in this area but we should encourage more people to upload images of their towns.  For instance, there is a Drogheda in the Past group on Facebook.  I am sure many people enjoy going on Facebook and looking at images of their own towns.  There is a huge respect for, and interest in, the past and how things were and how they never more shall be.<br/><br/>It is good to be able to look back and see the poverty from which we came.  We note the way people dressed, their small holdings and perhaps the tenements in which they lived.  That is all part of our history.  It is not just about the history of lords and ladies, the great and good and the wealthy; it is about the ordinary people and our social history.  These are the things that count.<br/><br/>Some years ago when I was a member of a local authority - I think I was first elected in 1974 when few people in the House were born - the local court house was being demolished because it was dangerous.  Before its demolition, I went into the building to see where, during the 18th and 19th centuries, judges gave rather difficult rulings against those who ended up on the wrong side of Australia.  Under the dias, the elevated platform where the judges sat, I discovered many old records, including indentures of apprentices going back to 1700.  When looking around other parts of the old court house, I found records on housing.  In the 1920s and 1930s when the county doctor visited a family, he would write about the conditions of the house and the people in it and the illnesses from which they may have suffered.  These records were a wonderful historic and social commentary.  The individuals named were special and I would not mention them.<br/><br/>Keeping archives is about keeping alive where and what we have all come from.  It is about what our ancestors did, how great they were, how poor they were and what little education they had.  In the case of my own family, I have found records going back to the 1830s, but I am able to look to the 1901 census, as can everybody in this House.  In the 1901 census I can see that my great-great-grandfather was unable to read or write and was unable to speak English.  He spoke only Irish, which was also the case with his bean ceile.  One can discover so much.  I love the work that is being done.  This legislation is empowering and improves the keeping and the collection of these records.  This is hugely important.  This is wealth from our past that we must keep.<br/><br/>Our Facebook today is our archive of tomorrow.  What people post on Facebook is there forever in its own way.  Perhaps, in many respects, it is the modern archive, which is one reason people must be very careful about what they post on it.  <br/><br/>This is hugely important work with great benefits for everybody.  We all need to know where we come from, who we are and what we are, and the collection and keeping of the archival material is a wonderful task.<br/><br/>I attended an event in Cooley, timpeall coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id mh&oacute;r ann le P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in.  T&aacute; cnuasach m&oacute;r eolais bailithe aici faoin gceol, faoin ngn&aacute;thshaol agus, ach go h&aacute;irithe, faoi na daoine a bh&iacute; ag maireacht&aacute;il le c&uacute;pla c&eacute;ad bhliain anuas san &aacute;it ar a dtugtar Oriel n&oacute; Oirialla.

Canadh an ceol seo den ch&eacute;ad uair le 200 bliain anuas.  &Oacute;c&aacute;id iontach a bh&iacute; ann.<br/><br/>The archives which P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in has collected in the area of Oirialla, or Oriel in English, which includes north Louth, south Down and part of Monaghan, records a wonderful, rich, beautiful, fabulous heritage, but it is more than that, it is historic.  P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in has put together a magnificent collection without pay or favour from anyone, with some support from the Arts Council.  She is dedicated to it.  On the night in question, as I said as Gaeilge, we heard the most wonderful, fabulous music which had not been heard in over 200 years.  Imagine going into a room where a man stands up and sings a song, a beautiful air that no one has heard in over 200 years.  This is the material being collected.  The P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;ins and all those like her up and down the country are fantastic in all the work they do.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an deich n&oacute;im&eacute;ad beagnach caite.<br/><br/>I refer to the wealth, the wonder and the beauty of the fantastic and wonderful traditions that we have in Ireland.  It is one thing to collect them and hold them dear in our hearts and minds, but it is another to collect them in order that everybody, no matter where they live not only in Ireland but all over the world, may access them and to make them digitally available in order that they may be kept forever is wonderful work.  It holds far greater truth and value to me than many of the speeches people like me make in here all the time.  It is our past but it is also our future from which we can all learn.  It makes us all humble.<br/><br/>In <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>Proust wrote of the certainty that the past is never over, it is always present; all one needs to do is look for it.  If one looks for one's own past, one will live alongside one's ancestors in their times and places.  They were no different from us, although their lives may have been shorter and tougher.  The collection of this material is wonderful.<br/><br/>I support this legislation.  I do not know how much funding is going into the National Archives, but I would like to see it increased by a multitude.</p></speech>

I have listened with interest to the input of Deputies on all sides of the House.  The various issues raised will be considered further by the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys's Department as the Bill makes its way through the Houses.  Issues of relevant costs are being dealt with and have been looked at by the Minister.</p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s unique and varied culture is a source of immense national pride that gives us a common sense of purpose.  The Minister and I believe it is crucial that we provide an accurate reflection of our history and our journey to the modern Ireland of today and that the National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important national cultural institutions.  The records held by the archives document the historical evolution of the Irish State and the creation of our national identity.  For this reason the Minister firmly believes that, notwithstanding the challenges it is important to provide the flexibility for records to be released after 20 years if there is strong case regarding their historical or public interest value.</p>  <p>  Our shared history with Great Britain and Northern Ireland cannot be underestimated and the Government is of the strong view that we must provide for the protection of the Irish perspective on that shared history.</p><p>The Minister has considered carefully moving to a 20-year rule and is of the opinion that, notwithstanding the significant resourcing issues involved, it is important to provide for the early release of records of significant historical or public interest value.  If we do not change the legislation by 2023 Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be releasing records ten years ahead of the Republic of Ireland and that would lead to an incomplete version of our shared history.</p> <p> We have listened to all the points made and will report back to Deputies.  The Minister's officials have taken note of what has been raised and they will examine what has been proposed.  I have a word of caution.  If Members have any amendments they want to table on Committee Stage, it would be of good value if they consulted the Department before doing so as it would help to speed up the process and make sure we had understanding of the amendments.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We are agreed that it is crucial that a deliberate and considered recruitment process takes place in order that the best possible candidate is appointed following a selection process.  We are also agreed that an overly long delay in the appointment of a new Commissioner would not be optimal for the organisation in terms of performance or morale.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say the authority has commenced the ground work for the recruitment process in advance of the formal triggering of the statutory process by Government.  I see this process taking a number of weeks during which the authority will engage with my Department and the Public Appointments Service, which will undertake the competition on behalf of the authority.  Importantly, it will also allow the Policing Authority to explore with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the new Commissioner.  As the Deputy is aware, the commission is undertaking a comprehensive review of all aspects of policing in the State and has considerable experience and expertise around the table in that regard.  I very much welcome the willingness of the commission to share its perspective with the Policing Authority in advance of completing its work, which is scheduled for September 2018.  This will assist in ensuring potential candidates will have as much information as possible on the future direction of policing in the State.</p>  <p>  Subject to the progress the authority makes in the coming weeks I expect the Government to be in a position to formally approve the authority to invite the Public Appointments Service to conduct the selection process in the coming weeks.  Once the process is triggered I anticipate that it will take between four to six months to identify and appoint a successful candidate.</p></reply>

In the immediate aftermath of the retirement of the former Commissioner, the chairperson of the commission on the future of policing stated she believed it would be appropriate that a new Commissioner would not be appointed until such time as that commission had concluded its work.  That caused concern among a number of people, particularly since it is envisaged that commission may take a considerable period of time to complete its work.  At the time, there was talk about a period of delay of perhaps up to 20 months or so.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I was there when the chairperson of the Policing Authority came in and she answered questions in respect of the appointment also.  As the Minister mentioned, the Policing Authority has an invaluable role to play in this respect.  She indicated she thought that would be too much of a delay.</p>  <p>  The Government also has a very important role to play since itt appoints the person, on foot of the nomination of the Policing Authority.  In particular, as the Minister is aware, under section 9(2) it is the Government that has to provide specific approval to the Policing Authority inviting it to allow the Public Appointments Service to commence the competition.  When does the Minister think that role will be commenced by the Government?</p></speech>

In that regard, let me assure the Deputy the selection of a new Garda Commissioner is a priority for me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, but also for all of my Government colleagues.  It is, however, vital, and I invite the Deputy to agree with me, that we ensure the selection process put in place is one that will be capable of delivering the best possible candidate.  The chair of the Policing Authority and I agree that the process must be approached in a careful and considered manner.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the point the Deputy makes on the Commission on Future Policing in Ireland and the comments of the chair thereof.  I again point out that the commission is not due to complete its work until September 2018.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would not be in the public interest, or in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an organisation or its members, to allow a state of uncertainty to surround the leadership of the national police service for such a lengthy period of time.  I am pleased to say from my engagement with the chair of the commission, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, that I know she shares my concern that a careful and deliberative approach is taken in the recruitment process in order that the best possible candidate will be selected and my concern that the process should not be prolonged beyond a reasonable timeframe.  I welcome the willingness on the part of the chair to bring the commission's wealth of experience and expertise to the process being undertaken by the Policing Authority and I share the Deputy's view that we should not allow an inordinate period of time to pass before filling this important position.</p></speech>

I also agree with him when he says the selection process should be designed in such a way that it will result in the best possible candidate being selected.  However, when we look at the legislation, it gives some cause for concern.  The legislation introduced by the former Government in 2015 provides that there must, first of all, be a competition run by the Public Appointments Service to identify who is the best candidate.  The Government sees great merit in competitions being run by the Public Appointments Service.  They are of questionable benefit and sometimes competitions do not result in the best and most appropriate candidate.  What does the Minister believe should be the basis of the competition being run by the Public Appointments Service?  Is the Government or the Policing Authority going to have any say in respect of that competition?  Is it the case the Public Appointments Service is simply going to come back stating it ran a competition and here is the winner and then the Policing Authority and the Minister will be bound by that decision?  We need greater selection appraisal than simply running a competition before we appoint the highest police officer in the State.</p></speech>

I also made it clear that as far as the Government is concerned we are not ruling in or not ruling out anybody in the course of the selection process for the next Garda Commissioner.  The selection of the next Commissioner is a job for the Policing Authority.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that what is essential is that we can ensure the best possible candidate is appointed, whether he or she a candidate internally or externally from the international stage.  The Government is supportive of the authority in that regard.  I am in agreement with the Deputy when I say that simply to rush matters at this stage to have a person in the post would be mistake.  I believe it is important that we allow the authority adequate time to complete its own preparatory work, including, as I said, the engagement with my Department and the Public Appointments Service which, as the Deputy has pointed out, is an important part of the process.</p><p>This will take a matter of weeks.  I envisage that we will be in a position to trigger the formal process in a few weeks, but I do not believe this timeframe is unduly long by comparison with the time normally taken to fill top-level posts across the public service.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy fully informed of the developments in that regard.</p></speech>

A courts process is under way to ensure wrongful convictions are set aside, with the first tranche of such cases resulting in the appeals being successful.  A dedicated team within the Garda is working with the Courts Service to expedite the process to rectify these fixed-charge notice or summons errors.</p>  <p>  All motorists wrongly issued with summonses will have their cases appealed, but it will take time to track down those who have changed address in the meantime.  Legal fees should be at a minimum as garda&iacute; are progressing the cases themselves where they can.  If motorists do not respond to the first contact, they will be further contacted, including through home visits, if necessary, to ensure that all appeals are finalised.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, to date, there is no indication that people have suffered imprisonment as a result of a summons issuing instead of an fixed-charge notice.   In the majority of cases, where an incorrect summons was issued, it was done in conjunction with summonses for other offences that were tried at the same time and regarding which penalties were applied correctly.  </p>  <p>  Since these matters came to light earlier this year, the Government, including me on numerous occasions, has made it clear to the Garda that this is a most serious matter and that the behaviour in question is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  The Garda report and the actions under way to address these serious errors are welcome but it is important to note that, at the Government's request, the Policing Authority is producing its own report, and it will deal with these issues comprehensively.  That report is due to be concluded in the coming weeks.  I am looking forward to the early receipt of that document.</p></speech>

At a meeting of the justice committee some weeks ago, I put this question to the Garda.  Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn told us that as many as 119 solicitors had contacted the Garda about adverse consequences for clients.  As the Minister said, nobody was imprisoned solely owing to a summons being issued instead of a fixed-charge notice.  I am aware, however, of cases of individuals having been arrested.  Such a case in County Kerry was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  The arrest entails a loss of reputation.  There are many reported cases.  Perhaps the lost penalty points led to a loss of a licence, which might have led to lost employment, among other implications.  Considering the 119 cases raised by solicitors, there clearly are  people who believe their circumstances are more severe than those encompassed by the current process being dealt with.  The correspondence the Garda is sending to people is largely administrative and does not deal specifically with circumstances beyond the reimbursement of the fine and the relevant process in that regard, nor does it deal with making good any loss other than the fine.  There seems to be no process.  When I put this to Ms Josephine Feehily, she stated she was not aware of any process to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

If he has any information that might be helpful, he should remain in contact the appropriate authorities.  I am not aware of any instances of imprisonment solely as a result of being a conviction following the issuing of a summons where a fixed-charge notice should have been issued instead.  In 96% of the 14,700 cases identified, the persons concerned had committed other offences in respect of which issuing a summons was justified.  I am aware, however, of recent media reports on individual cases and acknowledge what the Deputy has said in that regard.  I am not going to comment on an individual case that was the subject of media attention, but I can reiterate that any case of which I have been made aware involved other offences which were correctly punished by way of the issuing of a summons.  Therefore, the penalties imposed may well have been imposed.  There may be individual cases - again, I acknowledge what the Deputy said - where people received more severe punishments solely as a result of not being afforded the opportunity to pay a fixed charge.  I believe, however, that such cases comprise a very small minority.  As I said, no such cases have been brought to my attention.  I will be happy, however, to communicate further with the Deputy.  If he has information he feels backs up what he says, he has an appropriate avenue available to him, which I trust he will use.</p></speech>

Obviously, this still has serious implications for their reputation.</p>  <p>  My question, which has not been answered yet, is whether the Minister is aware of any specific process the Garda is undertaking to quantify the number of cases in which the aforesaid circumstances apply.  As I said, Assistant Commissioner Finn has said 119 solicitors have contacted the Garda specifically in regard to this.  Therefore, there are at least 119 people who believe that, on foot of the process as outlined by the Garda in terms of correspondence received, an administrative remedy and the possibility of reimbursement, they require further recompense, which may require an additional process.  Is the Minister aware of any proceedings that have begun against An Garda or his Department regarding this matter?</p></speech>

Even if it were, I would be most reluctant to comment on it, particularly if it were before the courts.  What I can say is that, in the meantime, while all these appeals are being dealt with, every effort is being made by An Garda to ensure each case is examined individually.  There are cases in which there may have been a change of address and there are instances where the places of residence of people who got a court summons were not immediately identifiable.  Every effort is being made by the Garda to deal with these matters individually.  While the appeals process is being engaged in, the outstanding issues can take their course in terms of whatever follow-up action may be required, if any.</p></speech>

Sometimes those criminal assaults are by other teenage boys.  These issues do not receive any recognition in newspapers or the national media, but the events have a very significant and negative impact on young teenage boys.  Are there measures Deputy Charles Flanagan, as Minister for Justice and Equality, can take to prevent these criminal assaults which have such a negative impact on the young person, particularly in mind of the extra difficulty that, in most circumstances, the assailant is also a teenage boy.</p></reply>

The law in relation to assault is not defined by age.  The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties, as the Deputy will be aware.  That Act provides for penalties of up to five years in prison for an offence of assault causing harm and for a penalty of life imprisonment for an offence of assault causing serious harm.</p>  <p>  While the main area of law which deals with assault is the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, section 18 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 created an offence of aggravated assault with intent to cause bodily harm or to commit an indictable offence.  A person convicted of this offence could face a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years or both.</p>  <p>  The general approach in Irish law is for the Oireachtas to set a maximum sentence in statute and to leave the precise sentence in any case to the discretion of the sitting judge who can have regard to the relevant principles and the circumstances of each individual case, including such factors as the age and vulnerability of the victim and the seriousness of the offence.  An Act of the Oireachtas which arbitrarily required that an assault on a person in one age category be treated differently from an assault on a person in another age category could fall foul of the constitutional requirement to treat all citizens equally.</p>  <p>  I advise the Deputy that the legislation in this area is kept under constant review by my Department in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, if he wishes to make specific proposals, I will be happy to examine them in the context of what he has just said.</p></speech>

As a result he required significant dental reconstructive work but, worse, it also had a significant impact on his self-confidence, in particular as the incident occurred in the area in which he lives.</p>  <p>  When the boy's mother contacted me I suggested she contact the Garda, which she did.  She said the garda&iacute; were doing their best, but as the Minister is aware, they can only respond on the basis of evidence that is available and prosecutions can only take place if there is evidence available.  In the aftermath, I contacted other people and was astonished by the extent to which such assaults are happening on a very frequent basis.  We do not see it in the newspapers or hear about it on the radio, but these events occur regularly to young men.  In a way because young teenage boys are affected, it is regarded as being acceptable and part of growing up.  It is not.  No young boy should be subjected to such violence.</p>  <p>  Since it is the case that such assaults are being committed to a large extent by teenage boys, what can be done with young offenders to prosecute them and ensure there is some deterrent in respect of these matters?</p></speech>

I agree with what he said.  It is essential that we continue to do everything in our power to protect the most vulnerable in society.  It seems that the case which has generated the question in the House does involve a vulnerable person, namely a young defenceless individual.  As I stated, a range of robust provisions at statutory level is in place to deal with criminal assaults.  I repeat that we always keep legislation under review.</p>  <p>  A person who has been the victim of an assault as described by the Deputy, whether they have been assaulted by a stranger or by someone they know, the best way to ensure their safety is to report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The decision to report the assault is entirely that of the person concerned.  In addition, there is a number of bodies who are able to provide assistance to victims of assault such as the Crime Victims Helpline.  The Deputy is aware we are at an advanced stage of completion of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) legislation.  I acknowledge the point made and I believe society needs to be vigilant in order to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected.</p></speech>

If I am assaulted or the Minister is assaulted there will be issues in respect to that but it appears to be different when the assault is perpetrated on young teenage boys by young teenage boys.  I read a report recently in <i>The Sunday Times</i>which said there had not been prosecutions in respect of young persons who had been arrested on criminal charges.  We need to look again at this issue.  As the mother who telephoned said to me - perhaps I am entering dangerous territory - that if this was happening to young girls in the area there would be uproar about it but for some reason society seems to tolerate gratuitous criminal assaults on teenage boys.  We have to send a message that this needs to stop, that it is unacceptable and it is not simply part of growing up.  It is a criminal assault on young people and we need to deal with it.</p></speech>

I agree that it is an issue that requires attention.  Of course, there are difficulties experienced by communities and individuals due to the anti-social behaviour of some youths.  One of the ways in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles these issues is through behaviour warnings and behaviour orders.  A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may issue a behaviour warning to a child who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  A behaviour warning is very much a preliminary step which must be taken before an application can be made to the courts.  Many superintendents in charge of districts are convening meetings on anti-social behaviour in order to ensure every effort is made to inform both parents and young people as to the legal situation.  A considerable number of behaviour orders have been granted.  Fines are imposed in respect of the breach of a behaviour order.</p>  <p>  Since 2007 a total of 3,564 behaviour warnings have been handed out and a number of behaviour orders have been issued by the courts.  That demonstrates that early intervention on the part of the Garda does have a positive effect.  I take very seriously the point raised by the Deputy and do not disagree with the issue he raised.</p></speech>

I am more accustomed to engagement with him in the foreign affairs arena.  I also welcome his question.  I should say the distribution of garda&iacute; is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  I can say, however, that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance for citizens and deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress in achieving the Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say budget 2018 will support the continuation of the high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 will remain firmly on track.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College and an additional 500 civilians will be recruited to fill critical gaps throughout the organisation to facilitate the redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new reserves expected to commence training early next year.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the Commissioner's responsibility for the distribution of the garda&iacute;, I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested by Deputy Darragh O'Brien in tabular form.  The tables set out to the number of garda&iacute; allocated to each Garda station in the Dublin metropolitan region as of 31 August this year, the latest date for which figures are readily available.  The Garda divisions referred to show that the Garda strength of the region on that date was 3,467.  There are 181 Garda reserves and 208 civilians attached to the region.  Where appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are active in the region.</p> <p> Tables to follow.</p></speech>

The Minister has said it is a matter for Garda management.  I understand that.  However, the reality is that stations such as the one in Malahide were downgraded by the previous Government.  In north Dublin the number of garda&iacute; is down by 20%.  Areas in which there is not a great Garda presence do not seem to be getting an allocation of new Garda recruits and I am concerned about this.  I hope there is a whole-of-government approach in so far as the Department looks at how resources are being distributed throughout Dublin.  The tendency is for many of the new recruits to go to the areas which are more visible, that is, the cities.  While new recruits and additional resources are needed in the centre of cities, the suburbs and outlying areas of Dublin cannot be forgotten.  That is my great concern.  Let us consider the figures for community policing, in particular.  For example, the entire area of Balbriggan with a population of almost 50,000 has only two community garda&iacute;.  For the whole of the Malahide district, the number of community garda&iacute; is down from six in 2014 to zero.  There has also been a decrease in Swords and there are no community garda&iacute; in the Lusk area.  These are examples of where it is obvious that we need to fill the gaps.  Community policing has been decimated, but it is crucial for good policing in any area, especially my area of Dublin Fingal.</p></speech>

They include areas of importance to the Deputy, including Balbriggan, Lusk, Skerries, Ballymun, Dublin Airport, Santry, Coolock, Malahide, Swords, Raheny, Clontarf and Howth.  I am happy to be able to make the information available immediately.  It is important in the context of policing for reference to be made at all times to the importance of community policing.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in that regard.  He made a point about recruitment, with specific reference to Garda recruitment.  The numbers I have given indicate a doubling of the Garda Reserve in the coming period.  Moreover, I advise the Deputy that there are in the region of 2,000 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My target is to have 4,000 civilians which would effectively double the current figure.  That represents a medium-term target of 20% for the level of civilian participation by 2021.  Currently, the figure is 14%.  Therefore, this will bring the force more into line with international norms and ensure trained garda&iacute; will not be engaged in administrative work or technical duties that could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy informed of the detail, although I know that he will keep me under observation as far as these figures are concerned.</p></speech>

I wish to set out some examples.  Let us consider the Malahide district which includes the Garda stations in Malahide, Portmarnock and Kinsealy.  The population is 27,000 as per the last census.  There are no community garda&iacute; in the district.  The Swords Garda district covers the size of a city, an area larger than Limerick.  As per the last census, the population was a little less than 50,000 and it had ten community garda&iacute;.  Balbriggan is larger than most regional towns and larger than some cities.  It has a population of a little less than 40,000 and has two community garda&iacute;.  In Lusk the number is zero.  In Rush the number is also zero because the Garda station has been closed.  the number is also zero in Skerries.  I am highlighting this issue because Garda senior management needs to look at these areas where it is obvious that numbers are down, in particular the numbers of community garda&iacute;.  I welcome the Minister's comments to the effect that he supports the concept of community policing, but it has been decimated in large swathes of the country, including my constituency of Dublin Fingal.  I would be happy to work with the Minister and Garda management to ensure it is brought back to the fore and made a priority in areas throughout the country.</p></speech>

In addition, a further 200 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to be attested later this year, which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to the 13,500 mark by the end of the year, representing an increase of 500 since 2016.  I am keen to ensure the points raised by the Deputy will be considered in respect of the assignment of garda&iacute; in the Dublin region.  We must have regard to the serious challenges An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faces on a daily basis in the Dublin metropolitan area, with particular reference to the tackling of organised crime.  I am keen to acknowledge the success of the continuing Garda operation in response to gang-related crime, Operation Hybrid, and the need to ensure we continue to facilitate the Garda in every way we can to ensure the provision of adequate and proper resources.  The results of the additional resourcing provided can be seen on a day to day basis in the Deputy's constituency.</p></speech>

It follows a decision that caused much public controversy.  Let us contrast this decision with the tangible lack of action in the advancement of work on a new regional Garda headquarters in Sligo where there is no running water and no shower facilities in the Garda station.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order offences.</p>  <p>  I recently published the second interim report of the Garda Commissioner which recommended that the former Stepaside Garda station in Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis.  It indicated that, subject to further analysis, the Commissioner was likely to recommend in the final report the inclusion of the former stations at Leighlinbridge, County Carlow and Donard, County Wicklow in the pilot scheme.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the report indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend that the former station at Rush, County Dublin be included in what will be a pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is liaising with the Office of Public Works on the proposed reopening of the former Garda station at Stepaside.</p><p>I understand the timeframe for reopening the station is dependent on a number of factors, including the brief of requirements from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the extent of the required refurbishment of the station based on current building regulations; the need to comply with fire regulations and provide disability access to the station.  There are also agreed standards and specifications for Garda detention areas and custody suites which would have to be incorporated into the refurbishment.  Once the specification has been agreed to, the works will go to tender and commence once the contract has been placed.</p></speech>

The Minister might want to tell his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to send a tweet that perhaps it might never happen, certainly if the rate of progress of work on Sligo regional Garda station is anything to go by.  In Sligo an existing, functional Garda station and regional headquarters responsible for policing in counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, with 140 garda&iacute; working in it, with an assistant commissioner, a superintendent and a chief superintendent, does not have running water, cells or shower facilities, despite the fact that towards the end of the summer many heroic garda&iacute; jumped into the Garavogue river and averted disaster by saving four lives.  Will the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross' Garda station in Stepaside join the queue behind the station in Sligo which is so dysfunctional, notwithstanding the difficulties for existing serving staff in not having appropriate working conditions, and from where prisoners have to be sent 15 miles.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has pointed to the standards required to be met in holding prisoners.  By contrast, there are probably umpteen Garda stations within 15 miles of Stepaside with umpteen showers, drinking water and active cells.  Will the Minister give a commitment that while Stepaside Garda station is at the beginning this process, since work on Sligo Garda station is surely at a much more advanced stage, we can look forward to having a new station there before we press ahead with the reopening of the Garda station in Stepaside?</p></speech>

The Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016 to 2021, an ambitious five-year programme that will benefit over 30 locations throughout the country, includes an investment of over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the capital plan and a major public private partnership project.  The new Garda station will be provided in Sligo.  The OPW placed advertisements in local and national newspapers earlier this year to secure a suitable site for the Sligo development, seeking expressions of interest from property owners and developers.  Returns were received in the spring.  The OPW, together with Garda estate management, reviewed the proposals submitted earlier this year.  A number of suitable sites have been identified as possible options for the development in Sligo.  The OPW is actively progressing the acquisition of a suitable site and it is understood the aim is to reach agreement on the purchase shortly.  This may not need to be said from my perspective, but, as somebody who is on the ground locally on a regular basis, the Deputy may well be in a position to assist the State authority in reaching agreement on the purchase of a suitable site.  I assure him of my interest in the matter.  It is important that we advance the project in Sligo having regard to the fact that funding is in place.</p></speech>

I am sure the other three Deputies will not mind me saying we will be delighted to push the issue as a matter of the utmost urgency.  I appreciate the Minister's offer in that regard.

It arises from a concern I have about Syrian refugees based in Greece who have looked to be assigned in Ireland and who have been told that they cannot come here because we do not have accommodation.  I know that refugees here are in welcoming centres, but they have been in them for too long and need to be located in the community.

To date, 1,406 persons have arrived in Ireland under the relocation and resettlement strands of the EU relocation programme.  I expect a further 738 to have arrived in Ireland under both programmes by early 2018.  Under the relocation programme, Ireland has pledged to accept 1,089 asylum seekers from Greece.  Ireland was the only EU country that chose voluntarily to participate in the programme.  It will meet its full commitment to Greece.  Some 621 persons of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 390 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation from Greece.  By early 2018, we will have admitted our entire cohort from Greece under the relocation programme.</p>  <p>  Under the resettlement strand, refugees located in countries such as Lebanon are brought directly to Ireland with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  Ireland originally pledged to resettle 520 refugees, double the amount the European Commission had proposed for Ireland, and we subsequently voluntarily doubled that number again.  I recently announced that our overall pledge would increase again, to 1,385.  Some 785 of these refugees are already in the State building new lives.  On the current locations of those who have already arrived, 602 persons are housed in emergency reception and orientation centres.  A total of 797 persons have been settled in 14 counties nationwide - Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Louth, Limerick, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wexford.</p></speech>

Will he update us on the position in bringing refugees here from Italy?  I know from the replies to previous questions that the former Minister had articulated a concern that the nature of our relationship and work with the Italian authorities had slowed down the arrival of refugees.  Will the Minister provide an update of how that section of refugees have been catered for under the programme?</p>  <p>  The numbers the Minister has given are interesting.  Some 602 persons are in emergency reception centres, while 709 have been resettled.  Is the Minister happy with these figures?  Having visited some centres, I am concerned that the time taken to get people from resettlement centres into the community has been longer than the ideal and that while the centres are doing a good job and the people running them are doing their best, support services in providing language training and for orientation have not been as rigorous and as intensive as they should be.  Will the Minister update me on whether he is happy with how the emergency centres are working and the speed at which people are being settled in the community?</p></speech>

There are 602 refugees living in four reception centres in counties Kildare, Roscommon and Louth in which they receive orientation support.  They also receive integration and language training support while waiting for housing to be sourced.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that there be no undue delay in the transfer of refugees from reception centres to long-term housing in both urban and rural settings throughout the country and that the full range of services should be available to them while awaiting relocation to ensure their other needs are met.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the programme was slow to become operational in the case of refugees from both Greece and Italy.  This gave rise to delays earlier this year.  National security is, of course, a competency that remains the sole preserve of each individual member state.  Ireland already had arrangements in place to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to travel to Greece to interview refugees which had been assigned to Ireland.  However, the position was not the same in Italy where, for various reasons, there were difficulties in allowing police officers from member states to carry out this important function on Italian soil.  The IRPP is working actively and positively to bring as many refugees from Greece as possible here by the end of the year.  This, of course, is dependent on a number of factors, including the provision of housing by local authorities for persons currently in reception centres.  There is the full and active engagement of the appropriate agencies involved.</p></speech>

I will go back to the Department about what is happening in Italy.  On how we will reallocate refugees into local communities, it is my understanding the reallocation will be towards areas there there is not a large social housing waiting list, which makes sense.  By definition, it is likely that these communities or towns are not exactly thriving, not the busiest or most popular.  Is the Minister looking at the integration of refugees from the point of view of completely turning around these towns, not merely from the point of view of supporting the refugees, in order that they will not feel they are dumping grounds with the least successful towns ending up taking refugees?  If we were to invest in the towns at the same time, it might change the whole attitude to how the programme works.  Would the Minister support such an initiative?</p></speech>

There are many towns which are offering refugees not only shelter but also a new and positive way of life.  The Deputy will be aware that Dublin will not be used in the resettlement programme, unless there are essential and specific needs that cannot be met elsewhere.  Certainly, from my experience of speaking to community leaders, for example, in Ballaghadereen, on the border between County Mayo and County Roscommon, there are challenges.  However, I am pleased to say these challenges are being met head-on by dint of the welcome received and a large measure of local leadership, as well as by the State agencies, be they in the areas of health, education, sport and recreation, the arts and culture.  People are ready to assist in order to ensure the stay of refugees in the commencement of their new lives in rural Ireland will be as comfortable and as welcoming as possible.</p></speech>

That independence has been purposefully conferred on the authority by the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  I will seek to respect the independence of the body in the reply to the matter raised by the Deputy.</p><p>The setting-up of the authority has been under way since July 2016.  At the time Parts 1 and 2 of the Act were commenced as necessary to have the new authority appointed and get it under way.  It has convened regularly since its inaugural meeting on 26 October last year.  Minutes of all its meetings are available on its website at <i>www.lsra.ie</i>.</p><p>In tandem with the ongoing and essential work leading to the authority starting its key complaints and regulatory functions, the authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and the making of five reports on a series of structural reform issues under sections 118 to 120, inclusive, of the Act which were also commenced.  It has been obliged to complete these reports within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016.</p><p>Having delivered on this substantive programme of consultations and reports, the current working focus is very much on the managed roll-out of the authority's remaining functions.  They include the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources which are essential, as the Deputy will agree, to effective delivery.  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers will be commenced.</p><p>In a key development, the authority has recently completed its public recruitment of a full-time chief executive, Dr. Brian Doherty, who took office in mid-September.  Having operated a modest executive office, it has recently secured larger office premises in support of the coming into operation of its respective functions.  Matters are ongoing with a view to having the authority reach full capacity at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It is difficult for Deputies to get answers unless we table questions to the Minister, being the appropriate Minister.  In the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we were perfectly within our rights to ask questions, notwithstanding the fact that the Garda was also independent in carrying out its functions and operational duties.  The reason I ask this question is that there is a certain degree of public disquiet about the fact that the authority was established, as I stated, 15 months ago.  It is the case, it has to be said, that members of the legal profession are being regulated using the old method used prior to the passage of the Act, but it is a cause of disquiet among members of the public that the new body which promises so much and which was greeted with such fanfare is not up and running.  It is regrettable that it is not up and running 15 months after it was identified that it had been commenced.  I asked a question about this in February and the answer I received was that the then Minister hoped it would be in substantive regulatory mode later this year.  The Minister is not responsible for this, but he has to be able to tell members of the public when the body will be up and running in order that they can make complaints.</p></speech>

That allocation is in the course of being drawn down.  A similar amount has been set aside this year in the justice Vote and any funding advanced from the allocation will strictly be on a recuperable basis.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the authority is working on several projects that will assist in identifying the staffing needs and resources required to allow it to support the ongoing roll-out of its functions to a structured and achievable timetable.  I had the opportunity shortly after my appointment as Minister to meet the chairperson.  I will be meeting the chairperson and members of the authority again before the middle of November to further discuss the authority's medium to long-term plans.  I have written to the authority to emphasise the importance I attach, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to the objective of getting it to open for business, in terms of the public complaints function, as quickly as possible, while also bearing in mind the risks and complexities which must be carefully managed in order to bring this about.</p></speech>

I still do not know when the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be operational.  I note that there are very important provisions in the Act.  Part 6 will set out the new regulatory regime and the basis on which complaints can be made by members of the public.  I do not know when it is going to be up and running, but members of the public should be informed about it.  They have not been given any information by the Minister in his reply today.  It is very important, from the point of view of the legal profession, as well as the public, that this body be up and running promptly.  The impression may be spreading abroad that the legal profession is not regulated.  The Minister knows that that is not the case, as do I.  However, the public may not believe it to be the case when they see that a new regulatory body has been established but is not up and running.  I appeal to the Minister not to adopt a passive approach to this statutory body.  It is one of the many quangos that has been set up by the Government.  I urge him to get out and ask the authority to become operational as soon as possible in order that members of the public can be assured that they are protected and that the legal profession is being regulated by an independent statutory body.</p></speech>

The authority, in turn, is working to progress, in conjunction with my Department, the identification of and elaboration on the more specific delivery dates concerned.  I expect these to apply to the respective functions involved during the remainder of the year and into the early part of 2018.  I do not wish to pre-empt the authority's independent planning and the completion of its commencement programme, but I do expect the relevant details to become available very soon.  If there are members of the public who have a concern, as outlined to the House by the Deputy, about the public workings of the authority to date, I remind the public through the Deputy that information is available on the authority's website at<i>www.lsra.ie</i>.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about the very serious public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  Tackling these issues, as the Deputy said, requires a multi-agency approach.  To better facilitate this, I have written to the relevant parties, including the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in order to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which could assist us in dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive way.  More recently, I have also written to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, given that the National Parks and Wildlife Service falls within its remit.  Responses have now been received from the majority of bodies.  As a next step, when all responses have been received, I intend to convene a meeting of all interested parties in order to identify more effective possible solutions and assign responsibility and timeframes for them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is already aware that, under the road traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is empowered to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, garda&iacute; may inspect a vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration or to drive carelessly or dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the parks and open spaces by-laws of 2011.</p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that there are issues of safety involved in the enforcement of these laws which are best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  I am informed that garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, including engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures which may be taken in order to restrict access to parks.  However, we must do this in a way that will ensure our parks, particularly those in Dublin, can be used for the recreational purposes for which they have been designed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that garda&iacute; have seized vehicles, but there appears to be a legal vacuum because I have anecdotal evidence of parents picking up quad bikes or scramblers that have been seized.  There appears to be an inconsistency or contradiction in terms of the legislation or its interpretation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is an issue of health and safety at play.  I acknowledge that in some instances local authorities and garda&iacute; have found it extremely difficult to intervene when there are a number of vehicles on a particular green.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on some of the responses he has received.  Has any of the relevant agencies proposed legislative changes?  We know that engineering solutions are an option for greens and parks, but they are not going to address the root of the problem.  These vehicles are being purchased across the board and green spaces in Dublin and elsewhere are out of bounds at times, when no State agency could safely intervene or interrupt the activity that is ongoing.  I ask the Minister to outline whether any of the responses he has received includes proposals for legislative changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900042#RR00800"><p>The Deputy has asked two specific questions, one about the adequacy or otherwise of the legislation currently in place and the other about vehicle seizures.  The road traffic Acts empower An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine or seize vehicles.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully enforce the legislation in the seizure, storage, release and disposal of vehicles.  However, there may be one issue worth looking at in that context.  As the Deputy said, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have the power to retain a seized vehicle where the person concerned produces satisfactory evidence of ownership and has paid the relevant charge.  It should also be noted that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have any legislative power to deal with scrambler or quad bikes being driven on private land.  However, local authorities have the power to introduce by-laws as they have done in respect of many parks.  My colleague at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has similar powers to control off-road vehicles in certain areas.  Unauthorised use of off-road vehicles is prohibited, for example, in certain national parks.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross that scramblers, quad bikes and other vehicles fall under the road traffic legislation when used in a public place.  I am further informed, however, that the legislation does not extend to the use of such vehicles on private property or in public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities or in national parks.  In the case of the latter two, however, local authorities and the Minister Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are empowered to introduce appropriate by-laws.  </p>  <p>  These are the issues I am anxious to discuss with all of the agencies in order that we will be in a position to ensure best practice is applied across the board.</p></speech>
