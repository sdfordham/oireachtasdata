Implementation of initiatives across these three strands is progressing well. <font color="#212121"> The trading online voucher scheme aims to get 2,000 small businesses trading online.  More than</font>700 businesses have been awarded vouchers of up to &euro;2,500.  Roll-out of a further 1,300 vouchers continues.  <font color="#212121">Early indications from the programme are that companies have experienced more sales and are expecting to recruit as a result.</font></p><p>Under the citizen component of the strategy, community and voluntary organisations are grant-aided to provide digital skills training to citizens.  More than 116,000 training places have been delivered under the BenefIT scheme since 2008 and more than 30,000 citizens will be trained in 2015 at more than 700 locations nationwide.</p><p>Following the roll-out of 100 Mbps broadband to every second level school in Ireland, last year my Department and the Department of Education and Skills ran a series of so-called switch-on workshops for teachers to showcase how digital technologies can enhance teaching and learning.</p><p>In tandem with these measures to stimulate use of technology, the Government's national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high speed broadband service of at least 30 Mbps.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>Last November the Minister published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  The areas marked blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016.  The amber areas show the target areas for the State intervention.</p><p>Following further public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process will be undertaken to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within five years.  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to address conclusively current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The programme for Government 2011 promised that fibre would be delivered in its term to the home or kerb for 90% of homes.  Has any millimetre of fibre been delivered by the Government in recent years?  In respect of the broadband scheme, which was promised before the local elections in April 2014, where is it at in terms of state aid approval by the European Union?  As we approach the first anniversary of that announcement, has it gone to the EU for approval and, if not, when is that likely to happen?  Statistics show that in the region of 80% of the country does not have proper broadband.  I had e-mails from parts of Dublin city and from colleagues on the local authorities in Dublin seeking information on broadband because some parts of their areas have very poor broadband facilities.  As the commitment was given four years ago this week that fibre optic cable would be delivered to the home or kerb for 90% of homes, has any millimetre of that been rolled out?  What is the position with the application to the European Union which was promised almost 12 months ago, prior to the local elections?</p></speech>

It is important to point out that the new national broadband plan has to be technology neutral in terms of EU state guidelines.  There has been much communication and consultation at European Union level.  The Deputy's last question was about possible European Union funds and strands of funds.  Consultation is under way to look at a combined package of money.  Obviously, at this stage we cannot give a broad figure because the procurement process will start and it will be full steam ahead at the end of the year.  In light of procurement, it is important we do not mention a figure.  However, there has to be a bundle.  There has to be national government funding, and there is possible European Investment Bank funding and a combination of funding.</p>  <p>  In regard to the kerb, which was the Deputy's first question, there is investment by commercial operators, for example, by Vodafone and the ESB in 50 large towns and Eircom with a further roll-out at a commercial level.  There is also fibre to cabinet delivery by semi-State companies for 70% of homes and businesses, with almost one third potentially having access to fibre to the premises.</p></speech>

Where is it at?  When the announcement was made last April in respect of the new broadband strategy, was it known at that time that application would have to be made to the European Union for state approval and was it a case of sending out a statement prior to the local and European elections that had no substance?</p></speech>

However, in trying to roll out a minimum of 30 Mbps to every house, the biggest challenge for Government is to ensure that it follows EU competition guidelines.  That is where the urgency and the focus have been in terms of ensuring that legally we are not pushing one technology over another.  As the Deputy is aware, some parts of his constituency have wireless.</p><p>From listening to people, fibre is a possible solution.  There is a backbone of cabling belonging to Eircom and infrastructure belonging to the ESB.  These could form part of the solution.  Those companies have been ploughing ahead and putting fibre on their backbones and Eircom has announced that it will bring broadband to more homes and premises.  More than 1 million premises have it now.  The critical issue for the Government is to get this right, that being, a minimum of 30 Mbps.  It cannot be the maximum in the long term, especially with so much data.</p></speech>

These negotiations are ongoing.  Their purpose is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth.  Ireland stands to gain significantly from this because of the existing significant flows of trade and investment between Ireland and the US.  Briefing and update material on the negotiations can be found on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, <i>www.enterprise.gov.ie.</i>I assure the Deputy that the conclusion of an agreement will have no impact on the public policy approach adopted by Ireland towards the exploration for unconventional hydrocarbon resources.</p><p>The scope of the European Commission's mandate to negotiate with the US includes investment protection and the ISDS.  Countries sign such agreements in order to set out certain ground rules when foreign companies invest in their territories.  The Commission's mandate to negotiate clearly provides that the objectives of any investment protection provision would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives, such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety, in a non-discriminatory manner.</p><p>I assure the House that no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration or extraction project in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, research programme directed at examining the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.</p></reply>

Most of the lobbying has been done on the part of big business.  There is a great deal of debate, but little has emanated from the negotiations so that citizens might consider the directions taken in decision making.  Some have pointed to the example of tobacco companies threatening to take governments to court because the former believed their markets might be damaged by the introduction of health legislation.  It is a risk, particularly in light of the ISDS element.  If tobacco companies and the like can legally threaten an elected government that is legislating on behalf of the population, TTIP is a bad agreement.  It might improve investment and industrial processing, but it will destroy democracy.</p></speech>

In terms of the research into hydraulic fracking, the two main pillars for ensuring that the study is done comprehensively and in line with the consultation are the environment and health.  The Deputy referred to the importance of people consulting.  A high percentage of people have contributed to the pre-consultation stage of the EPA's study and their opinions must be reflected in it.  Health is a key component in the consultation, although it was not at the beginning.  Health is now represented in the EPA study to ensure that all outcomes and aspects are considered.  Consultation is important.</p>  <p>  As to the Deputy's question, there is no connection.  The EPA's study on this matter is primarily focused on environmental and health issues and is not related to TTIP.</p></speech>

We have brought in a company that pretends to be a friend to the Irish people, has been gathering information and will take the Government and the people to court to protect its imagined future profits.  The Minister of State is aware that it has already taken legal action in connection with the Belcoo development.  In the US, Canada and Australia, it has taken local and national governments to court because it felt that they were not facilitating its development plans.  These are dangerous people.  Their job is to take money from national governments.  If their company does not take it from the ground in gas and the Government decides that, after all of the explorations, it will not get a licence, it will try the legal route to extract money from us as sure as night follows day.  The exploratory licences should never have been granted and we should not treat the company as a potential friend.</p></speech>

Although the European Commission will not necessarily set rules in respect of each country, it will have an important role in ensuring an EU-wide approach to anything that will affect the environment, for example, EPA studies and environmental impact assessments.  Every private company can use court proceedings at a broad level.</p>  <p>  The significance of the study is that it was done on a North-South basis.  There is a role for the North-South Ministerial Council to ensure that, while the study is ongoing, the political conversation will be ongoing as well.  I do not like the idea of an EPA study being boxed off for two years while, back at the ranch, there is no political conversation.  The political mechanism is the North-South Ministerial Council and possibly our Good Friday Agreement committee and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  As the Deputy knows, there is a different attitude at governmental level in the UK to this type of process.  We are keen to ensure that all of the collaboration and research is done on a North-South basis.  That is why we want university expertise from both jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In our county of Donegal, a proposal for a large wind farm is causing many problems.  In light of recent developments, however, it is no longer necessary that wind be the only source of renewable energy.  In order to allow alternatives to be developed, I am asking the Minister of State to consider placing a moratorium on future projects.</p></reply>

The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  A well-balanced fuel mix is essential to meeting these objectives for consumers and businesses.  Onshore wind contributes significantly to achieving these objectives.  A 2014 Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, report listed the benefits from wind electricity generation in 2012.</p><p>In summary, almost 600 kilotonnes oil equivalent of fossil fuels were displaced, valued at &euro;180 million, with a consequent carbon dioxide saving of 1.5 million tonnes, valued at &euro;11 million.</p> <p> A report published by the Council for European Energy Regulators recently found Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of monetary support per unit of gross electricity produced.  In other words, Ireland's approach to subsidising renewable electricity generation is amongst the most cost-effective in the EU. </p> <p> As we make the transition to a low-carbon economy, we will continue to assess the alternative energy sources that are available to us, including offshore wind in the longer term.  This was acknowledged in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in May 2014.  More than 1,200 responses to the public consultation were received and 12 public seminars were held to enable public participation in the finalisation of a White Paper, which will be published in September.</p> <p> It is essential that local communities are at the heart of the transition to a sustainable energy system.  The Department is currently finalising a renewable electricity policy and development framework, which is to be underpinned by a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment.  The proposed framework, which will be completed in 2015, will be a high-level strategic policy intended for the guidance of persons seeking development consent primarily for large-scale renewable electricity projects, as well as for the guidance of planning authorities, statutory authorities and the public.  The next stage of public consultation will commence shortly with the publication of the scoping report.  This work, along with a review of the existing wind energy guidelines currently being finalised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, will set a clear framework for the development of renewable energy infrastructure into the future.</p></speech>

I would disagree with that.  Our total renewable energy focus is on onshore wind.  At the time the plan was developed, back in 2007 or so, wind was probably the only viable technology, but technology has moved on.  Biomass has huge potential for meeting our renewable energy targets as well as for the creation of sustainable and renewable industry in rural Ireland.  Ireland could be a leader in producing and delivering biomass.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State says we have the lowest level of monetary support in the EU, but the investment of over &euro;4.2 billion in upgrading the electricity infrastructure that is anticipated through Airtricity - solely to accommodate industrial wind farms - means that situation will change very quickly.  We are already subventing wind farm operators by &euro;90 million per year, while for a fraction of that investment we could generate a wood biomass industry.  Simply converting Moneypoint to run off wood biomass would cost about &euro;400 million per year but would meet our Kyoto and carbon dioxide reduction targets in one go.  We need to look at this and we need a moratorium on onshore wind farms while we develop other alternatives.</p></speech>

A reliance on one source, especially onshore wind energy, as a single solution for sustainability is not the way forward.  I recently met a company looking to invest in Donegal in tidal energy, which was fostering the community approach in order to get community buy-in from day one.  In the Deputy's original question, he mentioned Donegal and the midlands.  I do not need to speak on behalf of the companies.  They know that mistakes were made in terms of pre-announcements.  For example, in the midlands, companies were saying they would build 10,000 wind turbines, which put the community's back up straight away.  There was no exploration of or conversation around community dividend or what the benefits to the local community would be.</p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle and I know that wind farms contribute about &euro;1.8 million per year to the rate base of Donegal County Council, but that does not mean we should continue to plough ahead in building more wind turbines that will affect and upset communities.  We have to be very careful and strategic.  That is why I am delighted there is going to be a strategic look at this.  There will be a consultation coming up shortly and there will be a more critical appraisal of how we meet community needs as well as the need for industry.</p>  <p>  We have to look offshore.  Industry people say that it may be too expensive off the west coast of Ireland, but we have to look at the west coast and the east coast as well.  There were company developments in respect of the Irish Sea, and negotiations were taking place on a bilateral basis between the UK and Ireland.  That is parked up until about 2018 or 2020, but there are still opportunities for offshore energy.  I will be encouraging the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, to include biomass as part of the mix in the context of the negotiations and consultations on energy.</p></speech>

However much we try to get communities on board and so on, they are still going to be facing that prospect.  We are still facing the prospect of having to invest &euro;4.2 billion in electricity infrastructure simply to facilitate those wind farms, and that is the problem.  Even if the communities accepted them and there was a dividend that put a few euro into the local community, we are still going to carry the cost of that.  The &euro;4.2 billion investment will be passed on to electricity consumers by Airtricity and the electricity companies.  We have far better, more cost-effective options that can generate sustainable industries in rural Ireland as well.  It would make far more sense to look at developing that rather than looking for ways to appease communities to get them to accept wind power.</p></speech>

Mistakes were made on the part of private industry, but I am certainly not going to speak on its behalf.  We have to learn from the mistakes that were made and bring communities with us.  Communities have to be at the heart of the solution for sustainable rural economic models.  That is why it is important that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is going to have a role in ensuring that the proper and thorough processes are adhered to so that we do not have communities feeling upset and disenfranchised in that they are not getting a dividend.</p>  <p>  We have to look at all the alternative potential, be it tidal energy, offshore wind or the Deputy's own suggestions of biomass.  We have to look at the complete mix.  We are importing 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas - which will change in a few months' time - and we have such a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, particularly considering the percentage mix in the 2020 targets for renewable energy.  I know the Minister, Deputy White, is on the same page as me in believing that communities have to be at the heart of the solution, in terms of ensuring it is acceptable to communities and that they feel part of the dividend as well.</p></speech>

It proposes that EU member states work collaboratively and intensively on a list of actions in pursuit of common energy policy goals.  Included in the package is a Commission communication on achieving interconnection of at least 10% of installed electricity production capacity for all member states.</p>  <p>  For energy consumers to participate fully in an integrated European internal energy market, poorly interconnected peripheral member states, including Ireland, will need improved electricity and gas interconnection.  An enhanced regional approach to delivering full European energy market integration is proposed.  In this regard, Ireland has witnessed the benefits of regional co-operation since the establishment of the single electricity market in November 2007.</p><p>The benefits of the single energy market include improved security of supply, competitive prices and increased penetration of renewable energy, each of which is a goal of the energy union proposals.  The completion of the North-South transmission line project will significantly enhance Ireland's level of interconnection with the UK.  Similarly, additional interconnections with France and the UK would further enhance our connectivity and bring benefits in security, competitiveness and sustainability.<br/><br/>To help the creation of an integrated EU energy market, the European Commission has drawn up a list of projects of common interest.  These projects are proposed by infrastructure developers, and the list contains several possible projects relating to Ireland.  While the projects are at various stages of development, with some of them still conceptual and possibly never coming to fruition, some of the projects could potentially underpin further integration into regional markets through additional interconnection.  The North-South transmission line project is included on the list of projects, as is the possible interconnection with France.  Several interconnectors with the UK are also listed, some of which relate to the possibility of trading renewable electricity with the UK after 2020.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The Department is engaging with the European Commission to clarify Ireland's current level of interconnection.  Depending on the variables used in the calculation, the level of a country's interconnection can vary.  I am advised that, at a minimum, Ireland has around 11% of electricity interconnection.  Notwithstanding this, Ireland would welcome additional investment to increase our connectivity, and opportunities will be pursued where possible.</p></speech>

These guidelines cover integrated offshore electricity grid development and related interconnectors in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the English Channel, the Baltic Sea and neighbouring waters aimed at transporting electricity from renewable offshore energy sources to centres of consumption and storage, and to increase cross-border electricity exchange.  The member states concerned are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  The interconnector with France is at a conceptual stage, but from speaking with people in the industry, I am aware of the opportunities associated with it.  If we are to move to a single energy market, we should not be restricted to connectivity with the United Kingdom.  From a personal point of view, I see France as an option but it is at a conceptual stage and we need to continue the conversation by keeping it on the agenda, whether in Strasbourg, the European Commission or the European Council.  We are all conscious of the importance of energy security given what is happening in eastern Europe.  We need to develop plan B and plan C, and if the interconnector with France is an option, we have to keep it on the agenda.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to wind farm interconnectors, which were intended to carry the electricity produced by a specific wind farm project, which has now fallen through, directly to the UK.  There would be no benefit to the Irish energy economy from that project.  It is vital that we have an interconnector with mainland Europe.</p>  <p>  The community dividend from the North-South interconnector also has to be considered carefully.  The way that project was handled was less than correct.  It was a shambles from start to finish.  We need a connection with the heart of Europe, and in this regard the interconnector with France must be kept on the agenda at EU level and certainly in Ireland.</p></speech>

If we want to keep something on the agenda, the question of resources and funding must be addressed.  There could be a role in this matter for the European Investment Fund and the Connecting Europe Facility, which can attract capital at favourable interest rates and, in turn, leverage debt and equity financing to enable major energy infrastructure projects to proceed.  The concerns of peripheral regions with inadequate interconnections and sources of energy can be addressed by these means.  While our figure for connectivity is currently at 11%, we need to build on it.  This debate needs to continue in this Parliament and in Europe, with a focus on the key issue of resources.</p></speech>

The Government's national broadband plan aims to deliver a minimum high speed broadband service of 30 Mbps to every home and business in Ireland.  This State intervention can be delivered over a number of different technology platforms and, in designing an intervention strategy and a procurement process, we must be mindful of complying fully with EU state aid guidelines by being technology neutral and not favouring one technology over another.  These guidelines do, however, allow for fibre to be deployed as close to the end user as possible.  Retail telecommunications providers would then be free to use a variety of technology platforms to reach the final customer.  We also need to ensure that State investment delivers a network that can meet current and anticipated future demand.  It must be capable of ensuring that there is no urban-rural digital divide and that rural based businesses and residents are not at a disadvantage compared with those in urban areas.</p>  <p> The planned intervention is being designed to deal conclusively with the rural connectivity challenge.  The comprehensive mapping exercise we completed in late 2014 shows a clear fibre backhaul deficit in many parts of rural Ireland.  This will need to be addressed in any intervention.  The intention is to design a clear specification around the services we wish to see delivered and then allow the bidders to submit tenders based on their ability to meet these specification requirements.</p></speech>

One of the few good things the Government did was set out a legislative basis for using the electricity network to provide fibre wrapped broadband throughout the country.  In respect of state aid rules, surely the Government could decide to provide a fibre wrapped network to every house and connection on the ESB network, which would then be made available to all the commercial operators.  This would be similar to the way in which the Eircom network was unbundled.  That option would ensure that the broadband deficit would be dealt with in a way that would give equal access to everybody in this country to the benefits of broadband.  At this stage, speeds of 30 Mbps are nearly obsolete.  We need to be looking at 100 Mbps or more to deliver an adequate broadband service.  The only way of meeting this objective is by fibre wrapping the electricity network and subsequently opening it up to market forces, or whatever forces one wants, to provide the end service to consumers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200006#D01100"><p>We have to get it right conclusively.  The more than 60 towns that Eircom will be targeting and the 50 towns that ESB, along with Vodafone, will be working with in the initial stages of the plan comprise large urban areas.  In rural areas, somebody employed by, for example, Pramerica in Letterkenny should be able to work from home in Malin Head or Killybegs.  That is the critical issue.  The national broadband plan aims to address areas in which commercial companies are not interested.  It is not commercially viable to go into these areas.  A potential solution, as Deputy Pringle correctly noted, is to wrap fibre around the ESB network.</p><p>However, the Government is constrained in what it can do because of EU guidelines and state intervention rules.  Most of these rural areas have wireless broadband, so there are competition issues in terms of whether the State can go in and compete with another provider.  We must be very clear in what we are doing and we must be technology neutral.  The Deputy is correct that a potential option is wrapping fibre around the ESB network.  That network goes to Arranmore Island, Tory Island and other peripheral areas.  There is also the Eircom network, however, and the question then is which one to choose.  Where we are at in the process is ensuring we are proceeding on a legally sound basis to deliver broadband, finally and conclusively, to rural areas.  That is the challenge we face. </p></speech>

I have looked at that company's plans for rolling out fibre to cabinet and I suspect that many people living close to the towns served will not actually receive an adequate service on that basis.</p>  <p>  The Government can make a strategic decision to roll out fibre to every house in the country, at which point the service can be opened up to the markets by providing open access to the fibre and allowing them to compete as they choose.  I cannot see any company opting to provide a fibre connection to Arranmore and Tory islands.  That is a serious problem because the people living there are entitled to the same connectivity as everybody else.  I do not accept that the Department is as constrained as the Minister of State has suggested in terms of being unable to pick one technology over another.  We have to make all technologies available to people and they will decide which they want to access.  That is what real competition is about, not deciding that because wireless is available in a particular area, the State will not compete with it.  That is not competition; it is boxing off areas for the particular providers.</p></speech>

The Government cannot go into areas that are not viable from a commercial point of view and wrap fibre around a particular infrastructure of its choosing.  There has been a lot of advice sought on this and a lot of legal advice given.  As well as ESB and Eircom, any other provider, such as UPC, to give an example, can choose to compete.  The process must be open to everybody, including wireless providers.  It is not confined to those companies providing one particular technology.  The firm advice we have been given is that we must be technology neutral.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the particular challenges that present in respect of the islands.  I am very clear in my conversations with the officials that we should be treating all areas equally and ensuring we deliver to the most peripheral areas in the country, including the islands, even where they are not commercially viable.</p></speech>

Will the Government engage with other State and semi-State agencies to determine whether there is an opportunity to take people out of unemployment and train them for skilled jobs under apprenticeship schemes?  What scope is there for such schemes?  The national broadband roll-out, which we have just discussed, might offer potential in this regard.</p></reply>

The Government is fully committed to renewing and significantly expanding the apprenticeship system in Ireland.  The recent announcement by the ESB Networks training centre of excellence in Portlaoise of plans to recruit 300 new apprentices in the coming years is a significant development in this regard. </p>  <p>  There are several other State bodies under the aegis of the Department actively participating in apprenticeship and graduate schemes.  Bord na M&oacute;na, for instance, recruits apprentices on an annual basis.  I understand it currently has 28 apprentices ranging from first to fourth year serving their apprenticeship in the trade of construction plant fitting, mechanical automation, maintenance fitting and electrical.  The company reviews the apprenticeship programme on an ongoing basis and plans to recruit apprentices each year based on the business requirements. </p>  <p>  In addition, Gas Networks Ireland is committed to providing opportunities for young adults through apprenticeship and graduate programmes.  These personnel will be provided with specific training which will ensure Gas Networks Ireland continues to have the appropriate core technical competencies within its business to deliver its work programmes and ensure the ongoing success of the business. </p>  <p>  The Engineers Ireland graduate placement training programme allows young engineers to gain experience in an engineering environment and the host organisation to benefit from their skills and enthusiasm.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland currently has three graduate energy engineers on this 23-month graduate programme.  To date, SEAI has enabled 32 interns to participate across 15 local authorities under the SEAI-led energy intern programme which commenced in 2010.  Under this programme, support has been provided to 70 SMEs in identifying energy savings of &euro;1.75 million for their businesses.  Electric Ireland has taken this programme and developed it into the Energy FIT programme which was recently launched in GAA clubs countrywide.</p></reply>

I accept, of course, that companies must make their own decisions in regard to operational matters.  However, if I were Minister, I would be surprised and disappointed if State and semi-State companies did not have due regard to Government policy and priorities.  If we are serious about taking people off the unemployment lines and getting them into quality jobs, we must seriously ramp up the apprenticeship programme.  In fact, I would go further and say that any infrastructural projects in which the State invests must include a social dividend clause which requires the engagement of a specific number of apprentices.  Building for the future is about more than building blocks; it is about giving people the skills to build for our future.  The people are just as important, if not more important, than the blocks.</p></speech>

In regard to the national broadband roll-out plan, I am getting a lot of information from industry that there is potential in this regard.  If the roll-out is to go to every single house in the country, we should be planning and preparing for that.  I am glad the officials are already having those conversations.  There must be joined-up thinking between the different interdepartmental groups and the various Ministers.  It is about upping the ante and co-ordinating our efforts.  There is scope to look at bringing in people who are coming out of certain courses and looking to add value to their qualification.  Ensuring there is a component of skilled apprenticeships is a social dividend, as the Deputy noted.  I thank him for raising this particular issue.</p></speech>

I welcome an Aire St&aacute;it.  I understand the issue of apprenticeships is really a matter for the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Damien English, but the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, also has a role to play.  Given that many semi-State companies outsource their work, is it possible that we could seek a social dividend, as Deputy Colreavy has suggested, which would require such companies to take some apprentices on board?  That is where much of the work will come from in future.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of companies that are outsourcing in different spheres.  It is a demand and supply issue and they are operating in the real world of business.  If they get the contracts to do the work, they need the people who can do that work.  My information is that there is a gap there.  "Gap" sounds a little negative; I should say there is potential there to bring recruits on board.  Not to throw it back to the Deputy, but perhaps he might seek a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, on the back of Deputy Colreavy's suggestion.</p><p>I certainly would not mind having this conversation and we can do it sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

A previous Administration introduced a national broadband scheme.  It did not have the same level of funding and it had flaws.  It would be a mistake not to recognise it did not deliver what was envisaged, although it delivered a good 3G network.  The national broadband plan is better funded and I predict it will have a much better outcome in delivering broadband to the country.  What areas are being prioritised in terms of public money and how the market will meet the national broadband plan?</p></reply>

The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high-quality, high-speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services, with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high-speed broadband services over the next two years.  These significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November the Minister published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked in blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016.  The amber areas show the target areas for State intervention.  The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or homes will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.</p><p>A public consultation on the map, which commenced in November, closed on 12 February.  A total of 29 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.  This will help inform the key decisions that require to be taken to finalise our comprehensive intervention strategy which will be published for consultation in July.</p><p>The strategy will address a range of important issues on the intervention, including the optimum procurement model, ownership and governance options, funding issues and levels of service for end users.  Part of the analysis being undertaken involves consideration of identifying and prioritising strategic connection points, such as enterprise parks, schools and other points of economic or social activity in rural communities.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The proposed intervention will also be subject to state aid clearance from the European Commission.</p><p>Following the public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process, in line with EU and Irish procurement rules, will be undertaken to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design the tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  It is anticipated that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a five year period.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to address conclusively current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

My question is on those locations the market will never enter without State subvention.  The State should intervene in these peripheral areas first.  In a reply to an earlier question, the Minister of State mentioned the islands and other areas where there is no hope the market will intervene, and these should be the first priority.  As technology develops and better systems become available, those areas where the market can make a viable intervention will become less clear and predictable.  To achieve value for money and sensible broadband roll-out to rural areas, the plan should start where the market is least likely to go and meet the market halfway.  This would be a sensible approach.</p></speech>

This is with regard to 90% of the geographical area but 30% of the population.  These are the most peripheral areas.  Earlier we spoke about the islands, and several islands down south, such as Sherkin Island, Bere Island and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, are close to the Deputy's heart.  Communities in the most peripheral areas think the further away their area is, the more likely it is to be dealt with last.  I have raised this point, and as part of the procurement process we examined whether those areas which are always last could come first.  This is the type of creative thinking we need.</p>  <p>  We are having a parallel conversation about how to save post offices, and Bobby Kerr who chairs the group has been considering the potential of post offices to become Internet cafes.  We cannot have Internet cafes on Tory Island, Sherkin Island or Bere Island if we do not have broadband.  We need creative thinking about where to start, but now is the time to have the conversation and feed into the procurement process.</p></speech>

If we are going to intervene where the market will not, I suggest we do so where the market will never be in a position to provide broadband.  If we are going to do so, we may as well do it sooner rather than later.  With improving technology and better systems, the market will approach more isolated areas, and as time goes on, it will become less clear where State subvention should be, but we should first work in those areas where State subvention is definitely required.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with it and it is a good suggestion. The Wild Atlantic Way had a number of tourists last year, and before it was actively or aggressively promoted, it was a success.  Somebody researching it on an iPhone in Bavaria and deciding to go to south Cork or north Donegal will expect to have Internet access when travelling the Wild Atlantic Way to find out what is happening in Galway, Clare, Sligo, Malin Head or Kinsale.</p></speech>

Gweedore industrial estate has a MAN, as do larger towns such as Letterkenny, Carndonagh, Buncrana and Donegal town.  At the time, overall responsibility for the MANs was given to Enet and I have had a number of conversations with its CEO.  The company wants to work on various projects on its MANs throughout Ireland.  I suggest the Deputy gets in touch with Enet's CEO because no doubt there are MANs in his constituency.  I get the feeling the company is open to ideas on potential creative solutions.  It is working in Ennis at present.  From what I hear, the company is looking to engage with the Government and there is potential.  The MAN in Letterkenny was not enough on its own to provide the proper infrastructure for big companies such as Pramerica, United Healthcare and Zeus.  Project Kelvin, a North Atlantic connectivity to Coleraine, Lifford and Letterkenny, provides another solution.  MANs are certainly part of the mix, and for the Deputy's information, Enet is open to conversation.</p></speech>

The post office network faces significant challenges given the impact of the economic downturn over the last few years, changes in technology and customer retail preferences.  However, it is also well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for government and financial services sector electronic transactions, as well as the more traditional over-the-counter transactions.</p>  <p>  The Minister recently established the post office network business development group under the chairmanship of Mr. Bobby Kerr.  The group's terms of reference are to examine the potential for existing and new Government and commercial business to be transacted through the post office network; to identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience; to engage, as necessary, with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the above objectives; and to prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable. </p>  <p>  The group&rsquo;s work will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network.  Its final report will be available during the course of this year.  Operational matters, including the closing of post offices, are issues for the board and management of An Post.</p></speech>

While whether a post office remains open or closed is not a matter for the Government, the importance of retention of post offices has been a matter of huge concern for members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, particularly backbenchers.  The strong conversation around the need for retention of post offices led to the establishment of the post office network business development group, which is expected to report soon on the issue of the sustainability of post offices.  As part of this critical mix, there will need to be a sharp focus on banking.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this morning I spoke to the postmaster on Tory Island, Mr. Jimmy Rogers.  People from Tory Island who wish to withdraw money from their post office accounts are required to travel to the mainland - some people on Tory Island believe it is the mainland, with which I agree - to withdraw money from their post office accounts via an AIB ATM.  Post offices need to engage more in banking services.  It is also important that there be a greater focus on the availability of government services through An Post, which is where the conservation is at.  As I am a member of the post office network business development group, I do not propose to engage in predicting the likely outcome of its review.  Discussion on the matter is ongoing.</p></speech>

In the many years I have been a Member of this House, and for many years prior to that, the closure of post offices and the detrimental effect of this on rural communities has been an issue of concern to Members on all sides of the House.  We must be bold.  We need to change the memorandum of understanding for An Post.  As in the case of the ESB, which has a public service obligation to deliver electricity to every house and business in the country, An Post should be required by public service obligation to maintain the post office network as it currently stands.  Enough is not being done by An Post in terms of business service provision.  We need to encourage it to focus more on this area and we need also to focus our attention on the generation of business that will sustain our post offices.  If we do not do this, we, or others, will be here in five or ten years' time discussing the same issue.  It is time we faced down this issue.  We must also change the memorandum of understanding of An Post, given the change in its constitution.</p></speech>

During that time, 24 post offices closed.  During the six-year period between 2004 and 2010, 345 post offices closed.  On the basis that this has been the trend, the Government takes this matter very seriously.  The Government has faced enormous pressure at parliamentary party meetings in relation to the need for retention of post offices.  Post offices are a critical part of the community infrastructure.  Friday is an important day for the elderly in rural and isolated communities.  They do not all go to bingo on a Wednesday night, so visiting the local post office on a Friday is often the only point of contact for them.  There is a massive social dividend here that needs to be protected.</p>  <p>  I take on board the Deputy's constructive suggestion.  I look forward to engaging further with him on the matter when it comes to the debate on the report of the post office network business development group, which, as I said, is being chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr.</p></speech>

It reflects the Government and European objectives to deliver new opportunities for jobs, growth and social inclusion.  The digital agenda for Europe commits to the delivery of 30 Mbps broadband to all citizens by 2020.  This was to be achieved through a combination of commercial and State investment.   </p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high-speed broadband services over the next number of years.  These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p>  <p>  While the enhanced investment by industry is very much welcome, it is exacerbating the divide between those areas benefitting from the accelerated commercial investment and other areas, predominantly rural, where available commercial speeds remain very basic.  The Government's broadband intervention will ensure the availability of high-quality future-proofed broadband services to all other parts of the country.  It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  </p>  <p>  To definitively address the broadband challenges faced by Ireland, the State intervention under the national broadband plan will present a long term future-proofed solution which will address those areas of the country identified in the mapping exercise conducted last year with no present or planned next-generation access services.  Through the national broadband plan, it is our objective to ensure that all citizens in every part of the country have access to high-speed, high-quality broadband services that will put Ireland at top of the class in terms of access to broadband services throughout Europe.</p></reply>

The amendment is somewhat different from what I had indicated in that I am now providing for collective citations of the Civil Registration Acts and Child Care Acts.  However, I am not providing a collective citation for the Guardianship of Infants Act with Part 4 since all of the changes to that Act are full textual amendments and this limits the value of a collective citation.  The amendment is technical in nature and relates to the Title and commencement dates.</p></speech>

This group of amendments provides for changes to the definitions which apply throughout the Bill.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide for additional clarity and certainty.  Amendment No. 3, in particular, provides a new definition of &quot;donation facility&quot;.  This is to ensure that if gametes are donated to a facility which deals with donation but does not provide other donor assisted reproduction services, this does not preclude the use of these gametes by facilities in the State.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are direct consequential amendments to this new definition.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 provides a technical redraft of the definitions of the terms &quot;intending mother&quot; and &quot;intending parent&quot;.  The purpose of this change is to make it obvious that only the intending mother can request a medical procedure to be carried out on her.  The other intending parent consents to being a parent of a child born as a result of the procedure but does not request the procedure. </p><p>Amendment No. 7 clarifies the definition of the term &quot;relevant donor&quot;.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 make some linked changes to the definition of the term &quot;donor&quot;.  This was necessary because on some occasions where an embryo is donated, a donor of the embryo for whose use the embryo was originally formed may or may not himself or herself have a genetic connection with the embryo.  Only the information of a relevant donor, being a donor who provided a gamete used in forming the embryo, should be recorded on the national donor-conceived person register.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 16 are direct consequential amendments to this new definition.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I missed the Committee Stage discussion on this amendment which I have resubmitted on this Stage.  It is important that those who avail of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, appreciate all the ethical and legal issues that arise before proceeding with treatment.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure such persons fully understand their responsibilities.</p></speech>

It is striking to consider the number of couples availing of fertility treatment here and I accept the Deputy's point on donor-assisted human reproduction.</p>  <p>  As I indicated on Committee Stage, the Bill focuses entirely on one aspect of assisted and donor-assisted human reproduction, namely, parentage issues.  Responsibility for the wider issues involved remains fully within the remit of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  On the day the Cabinet approved this Bill, it also gave the Minister permission to draft legislation on the wider area of assisted human reproduction, AHR, which has remained unregulated since 2005.  This was a very welcome decision.</p>  <p>  The Minister's proposal will deal with the wide range of AHR issues that need to be addressed.  I will discuss later the large number of AHR issues which have not received any attention until now, all of which come within the remit of the bioethics unit of the Department of Health.  This unit assumed responsibility for providing information to Cabinet, including the proposed heads of the Bill.  The head of the unit has been working with my Department on the issues involved.  The wider issues will be considered in the subsequent legislation.</p>  <p>  The counselling of individuals or couples who are considering or planning treatment is very much within the policy area of the Minister for Health.  His proposals in this regard, which were recently approved by the Government, include requirements that people availing of all forms of assisted human reproduction undergo counselling in advance of treatment.  This has been accepted in principle.  I have discussed these issues with clinicians involved in assisted human reproduction and they are very clear on the need for counselling.  However, the clinics are not currently regulated.  The Medical Council has developed guidelines to which the professionals adhere and each clinic has its own guidelines.  We want to reach the position where national guidelines are implemented in the clinics.</p>  <p>  I hope Deputy Mac Lochlainn will understand that while I support the principle underpinning his amendment, I cannot accept it because the Bill's scope in respect of assisted human reproduction is limited.  The legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health will address the issue he raises.  Responsibility for matters such as the precise nature of counselling, the way in which counselling should be made available and how much counselling couples should avail of rests with the Department of Health.  I give the Deputy a commitment that counselling will be addressed in the Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Health.  The Government has accepted the Minister's proposal in principle.  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment in view of my response.</p></speech>

The Deputy will appreciate that this is in effect new work.  The Minister has given a commitment to produce heads of a Bill later this year.  He intends to have a wide-ranging consultation, which will be welcomed.</p><p>Despite our best efforts to date, the provision of the broadband service we lack has not manifested itself yet.  Could the Minister of State outline any initiatives that could be taken, apart from the national broadband plan, to co-ordinate efforts and to mark it in terms of achieving particular objectives along the way in order to make this a reality as quickly as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200011#H00200"><p>That is a fair question.  We have outlined the time period.  We will seek to move the procurement process forward towards the end of this year.  In 2016, we will start to roll out broadband in the areas that are not commercially viable for private companies.  People do not want to hear about a three to five year period for the provision of broadband.  Deputies live in the real world and when companies approach them with an idea for locating in a rural area, when they tell them there will be no broadband for some time that is not what they want to hear.</p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan's question is critical.  It is important that we continue to seek creative solutions in the interim in terms of what we can do with private companies.  Private companies can work with each other.  For example, Vodafone and the ESB worked together on projects in the 50 largest towns.  There will be a further roll-out in that regard in the second phase and third phase.  A lot will happen at that level.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I am pushing very strongly the agenda that we would provide broadband in Gaeltacht areas where we are trying to attract investment.  There is a sense of urgency in that regard.  I appreciate the Deputy's position.  He is correct that he has heard it said previously that we will get it right.  He heard that years ago.  However, it is about getting it right, and it is also not just about providing a solution of 30Mbps because children in the Visitors Gallery will be going to secondary school in a few years and their expectation will be akin to that of Paddy McGilligan in the 1920s, namely, that they will just press a button on the wall and they will have access to broadband-----</p></speech>

I sincerely hope they are not applicants for the old age pension before it all becomes a reality.

I accept you have requested brevity, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I will respond to Deputy Durkan on the demands for the here and now.  We must continue to engage with the private companies because they are looking at alternative solutions.  If I hear from people within industry that there is a deficit in the number of apprentices, then the Government can help.  One element we can deliver is to train up more people and give them the skills and expertise in order that they can be available to those companies.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Stanton, Members across the House all hear the same thing every day from people with business ideas who want to go to a certain area where there is no broadband.  The situation is reflected in the critical mass of oral parliamentary questions today which predominantly relate to broadband.  That is the issue.  Deputies have their ears to the ground.  We must respond to the demands of the electorate in our constituencies and ensure people are not discriminated against in terms of service provision.  That is why it is critical that the State-led intervention is done correctly.  We do not want to be faced with a situation whereby once the procurement phase commences, things are not done right and we are back to square one.  We are ploughing ahead.  I am happy with the efforts, number of meetings and the work that has gone into it at an official level.</p></speech>

It is a major issue.  Are any stakeholder meetings planned on the spend and other serious issues relating to the State broadcaster, RTE, but in particular the licence fee?</p></reply>

Licence fee revenues are distributed in accordance with section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in the following prescribed manner.  From the gross TV licence fee receipts, the Department first deducts commission payable to An Post in respect of its role as the Minister's issuing agent for TV licences.  TG4 also currently receives &euro;9.245 million from the gross receipts.  Following these deductions, 7% of the net revenue is paid to the broadcasting funding scheme.  The scheme, which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, was established to provide funding in support of the production of high quality programmes by independent producers and broadcasters on Irish culture, heritage and experience, and programmes to improve adult literacy.  The scheme also supports certain archiving projects being undertaken by broadcasters.  Any revenues remaining following these payments are provided to RTE.  The purpose of the TV licence revenues paid to RTE and TG4 is to facilitate the pursuit of each broadcaster's public service objectives, which are set out in the 2009 Act.</p><p>Statutorily mandated annual and five yearly reviews are conducted by the BAI which must consider whether each broadcaster has fulfilled the commitments set out in its annual statement and make a recommendation as to whether there should be an adjustment to the level of public funding. The first five-year review was undertaken in 2013 and this work included a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement with market players and other interested parties, involving both face-to-face interviews and written submissions.</p><p>The results of that review, and the Government response to it, acknowledge the very significant programme of cost savings implemented by RTE since 2008, whereby it has reduced its operating costs by 30% and reduced its staff by more than 500 people.  Members will be aware that a service which was provided in the UK has been taken off the air.  It is also worth noting that these efficiencies were achieved in a period where RTE's annual revenues fell by 26% and where, despite the impact of this period of restructuring on the broadcaster, RTE continued to deliver its full range of services and achieved a break-even position in 2013.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government response to the five-year review tasked NewERA with conducting an independent assessment of the scope for further efficiencies within RTE, including an examination of achievable efficiencies in its performing groups service model and the manner in which it delivers Irish language radio services.  As part of this review, NewERA has also reviewed the scope for optimising the use of independent productions as part of RTE&rsquo;s programme output.  The Minister is currently considering the findings of the NewERA report prior to bringing it to Government and intends publishing it shortly thereafter.</p></speech>

It is separate and distinct from the existing section 14.  That section deals with embryo donation only where the embryo in question was itself formed using donor gametes and where the person or couple from whom it was formed have completed their family and now wish to donate an embryo or embryos to assist others.</p><p>The proposed new section provides for the situation in which a couple has undertaken fertility treatment in the course of which embryos have been formed using their gametes.  It ensures that if, having completed treatment, they wish to donate any remaining embryos, they may do so.  Their donation must be in accordance with the same general conditions that apply where a donor embryo was formed using donor gametes.  In particular, if there is a child born later as a result of their donation, their details will be recorded on the national donor-conceived person register in order that the child's identity rights will be safeguarded.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 is consequential on amendment No. 19.  It specifies the information that must be provided to couples who donate embryos which were formed using their gametes.  It is similar to the existing section 5 except that in this case the identities of both donors are recorded on the register because both contributed a gamete to the embryo's formation.</p></speech>

gamete--<blockquote>(i) has consented under <i>section 6</i>to the use of the gamete in a DAHR procedure, or<br /><br />(ii) where the gamete is acquired from outside the State, has consented to the use of the gamete in a DAHR procedure, where that consent is substantially the same as that provided for in <i>section 6</i>.</blockquote></blockquote>(2) The operator of a DAHR facility shall not use or permit to be used in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure an embryo unless--<blockquote>(a) it has acquired the embryo in accordance with <i>section 22(2)</i>, and<br /><br />(b) the donor, or as the case may be, each donor of the embryo--<blockquote>(i) has consented under <i>section 14</i>, to the use of the embryo in a DAHR procedure or, as the case may be, a further DAHR procedure, or<br /><br />(ii) where the embryo is acquired from outside the State, has consented to the use of the embryo in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure, where that consent is substantially the same as that provided for in <i>section 14</i>.</blockquote></blockquote>(3) The operator of a DAHR facility shall not use or permit to be used in a DAHR procedure a gamete provided by a donor, where he or she has become aware that--<blockquote>(a) the consent of the donor under <i>section 6</i>has been revoked under <i>section 8</i>, or<br /><br />(b) in the case of a gamete to which <i>subsection (1)(b)(ii)</i>or <i>(5)</i>applies, the consent of the donor referred to in that subsection has been revoked.</blockquote>(4) The operator of a DAHR facility shall not use or permit to be used in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure an embryo where he or she has become aware that--<blockquote>(a) the consent of the donor under <i>section 14 </i>has been revoked under <i>section 16</i>, or<br /><br />(b) in the case of an embryo to which <i>subsection (2)(b)(ii)</i>or <i>(6)</i>applies, the consent of the donor referred to in that subsection has been revoked.</blockquote>(5) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, for a period of 3 years from the date on which that subsection comes into operation, a gamete to which <i>paragraph (a)</i>of that subsection does not apply may be used in a DAHR procedure where--<blockquote>(a) the gamete concerned has been acquired before that date by the DAHR facility concerned,<br /><br />(b) the donor of the gamete has consented to the use of the gamete in a DAHR procedure, and<br /><br />(c) the intending parent is the parent of a child born as a result of a DAHR procedure performed before that date, where the gamete used in that procedure was provided by the same donor.</blockquote>(6) <i>Subsection (2)(a)</i>shall not apply to an embryo where--<blockquote>(a) the embryo was formed before the date on which the subsection comes into operation,<br /><br />(b) the embryo was acquired by the DAHR facility before that date, and<br /><br />(c) the donor or, as the case may be, each donor of the embryo has consented to the use of the embryo in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure.</blockquote>(7) Where an embryo to which <i>subsection (6)</i>applies is used in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure, nothing in this section shall operate to prevent the recording on the Register of the information specified in <i>section 31(3)(d)</i>in respect of the donor from whose gamete the embryo was formed.<br /><br />(8) The operator of a DAHR facility may use or permit to be used in a DAHR procedure an embryo that was formed before the date on which this subsection comes into operation, where--<blockquote>(a) the embryo has been formed for the purposes of the DAHR procedure,<br /><br />(b) the donor of the gamete that was used in the formation of the embryo has consented to the use of the gamete in a DAHR procedure, and<br /><br />(c) each person who, at the time of the formation of the embryo, was an intending parent, has consented under <i>section 9</i>, or as the case may be, <i>section 11</i>, to the parentage under <i>section 5</i>of a child born as a result of the procedure.</blockquote></blockquote>On Committee Stage I indicated my intention to make certain amendments in this section, in particular to clarify the nature of a donor's consent referred to in subsections (5)(b) and (6)(c).  Both subsections refer to gametes and embryos, possibly anonymously sourced, which are the subject of certain transitional arrangements.  The original information specified that the consent should be substantially the same as that provided in sections 6 and 14.  However, given that those consents are so focused on the identity of the donors, I concluded that this threshold was too high and would make the transition provision unworkable.  Accordingly, I have changed those to specify that the donor has consented to the use of the gamete or embryo in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.  The revised provision also includes a new subsection (8) which clarifies that where a person or a couple have existing embryos created using an intending parent's gamete and a donor gamete, there is no legal barrier to their using those embryos in a DAHR procedure.  There are also consequential amendments and cross-references to the new section that is inserted by amendment No. 19.</p></speech>

The only reason I resubmit the amendment is to firm up the assurance that, after the enactment of the legislation, families who have availed of the various types of procedure as outlined in the amendment would have the extra one year.

The amendment would provide for a transition period to allow couples currently undertaking donor-assisted human reproduction procedures to continue their treatment and to facilitate an orderly move to the regulatory framework, which is envisaged in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  The Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists also raised this issue and, obviously, the availability of such a transition would be of huge concern to many couples.</p>  <p>  These provisions have to be worked on further and more detail is needed.  On Committee Stage I indicated my broad agreement that such a transitional period had its merits and, indeed, I believe it is necessary.  As the Deputy has outlined, certain transitional provisions are already included in section 20(5) and 20(6).  The Deputy's provision in the proposed subsection (10) would, to some extent, cut across the provisions set out in subsection (6), which sets out a three-year period that is, effectively, a four-year period, given the transition period of at least one year from the commencement date.  This is to allow the couple to have a sibling using gametes from the same anonymous donor.</p>  <p>  I said on Committee Stage that I was prepared to offer a clear commitment to the House, together with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that Parts 2 and 3 would not be commenced for a minimum period of one year from the date of enactment.  I repeat that commitment today to ensure that the interests of the many couples undergoing the stresses of donor-assisted fertility treatment can, with their medical teams, continue their treatment.  The one-year period will provide at least the same transition period, which will enable couples currently undergoing treatment to continue with that treatment and will give clinics time to prepare for the new regulatory framework.  This is a practical and pragmatic administrative solution for which I am today giving a binding commitment in order to enable a seamless transition to the new arrangements.  On the basis of that, I ask Deputy Mac Lochlainn not to press the amendment.  I have given a very clear commitment in regard to accepting the need for a transition period as well as outlining how long that will be in both instances.</p></speech>

As I said, this is a critical issue on which the Bill is very clear.  On the amendments, I had indicated on Committee Stage that I intended to provide drafting clarification in this section to ensure it is clear which facility must retain records of consents or revocations of consents.  Again, it is extraordinary to think that, since the commission reported in 2005, this issue has not been dealt with.  However, we are saying in each case it is at the facility at which a donation is made, or where the consent was given, that the records must be maintained.  These amendments provide that clarification and make the necessary consequential amendments, including taking account of the new cross-references.</p></speech>

This information will be life-changing for the person who receives it at the age of 18 or 19.  It cannot happen in a bald way.  What are the arrangements for ensuring that it is dealt with sensitively?</p>  <p>  I refer to medical information.  Is the Minister making any provision for medical records or information to be made available?  This is a critical issue for people who are not aware of who their genetic parents are until they are adults.  What arrangements, if any, is the Minister making to ensure that information is available?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, anonymous donations are accepted in this country.  That means, in effect, that a child has no access to genetic information.  This Bill and the new AHR Bill make it absolutely clear that as a policy and principle a child has the right to have access to that information.  It is the first time we are including in legislation the very relevant point the Deputy made, that is, that a child is entitled to have access to that information.  There will be a change in the regulations from anonymous to non-anonymous so that a child will have access to genetic information.</p>  <p>  The Bill is very clear in its provisions on consent.  The rules on donor consent in respect of parentage will state it must be given very clearly.  The kind of information which must be kept will be very clear in the consent forms, which will have to be developed under regulations.  There is an issue around the arrangement to develop and record the information, and I have spoken about how the records will have to be kept by the relevant clinics.  The information will have to be gathered and available.  The issue of consent is relevant to this discussion.  </p>  <p>  A register of information will have to be kept in the Department of Health to begin with, but will then move to the new authority when it is established.  Much like having access to adoption information, procedures and information such as these are very sensitive.  It would be the responsibility of parents to share this information.  Parents will know that their children are entitled to this information.  In the same manner as adoption, the best practice is to tell a child at an early stage that he or she is adopted.  We are moving towards more open adoption.  As in the case of adoption, in cases of assisted human reproduction the best practice, as I have been informed based on a review of the international literature, is that the more open parents can be with children, the better the outcome.  </p>  <p>  As the Bill progresses, we will have the same sort of supportive system we would like to have for those seeking information on adoption.  The Minister, and eventually the authority, will develop procedures on that information.  The information applies to those who are 18 years of age, but this provision deals with non-identifying information.  It will be available before that.  One would expect and demand that clinics keep all relevant medical information on a donor.</p></speech>

This issue, along with many others, underlines the problem with rushing this Bill.  I suggest, given the fact that only four Members are in the Chamber, that the vast majority of Deputies have not read the Bill.  It is very fundamental and should not have been rushed, a point I want to repeat.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister what the arrangements will be for passing on that information.  When an 18 year old requests his or her birth certificate, what will be the arrangements for telling that person there is additional information?  It is not adequate to say that this will be developed as the Bill progresses.  It will be passed and signed, I presume, within the next few weeks.  </p>  <p>  What arrangements will be in place to ensure that people will get access to that information?  Will all registrars know that some additional information may need to be passed on?  What will the advice be to registrars in terms of how that life-changing news is passed on to somebody and ensure it is done in a sensitive way?  Is it the intention of the Minister that health information would form part of the anonymous information that would be available to a young person in those circumstances?</p></speech>

It would be non-identifying information, in that a donor's name would not be given at that point.  Non-identifying health information would be given and collected in the first instance by the clinic.  We had a debate on the Bill on Committee Stage, at which Deputy Shortall was not present, and there was no guillotine in terms of Members' opportunities to contribute, nor was there on Second Stage when 60 Members made contributions.  It is true that we are prioritising and allocating time to the Bill.</p>  <p>  The details of what could be called the support system that would be built around the provision of the information is something that will be developed in the AHR legislation.  This is not retrospective, except in very particular instances such as where court proceedings allow for it in certain very clear situations.  This is prospective.  When a child is 18 years of age, he or she will have access to identifying information.  There is time to develop regulations and best practice, which should be in the best interests of the child, on the provision of this information.  </p>  <p>  We have had detailed contact with the Department of Social Protection on the necessary changes to the register.  This information is like that concerning adoption, where there is a different type of birth certificate.  In cases of AHR or DAHR, the person seeking a birth certificate will be told extra information is available.  I agree with the Deputy that this is critical for individuals and that is the reason the Bill addresses that point, namely, that the identity of the donor must be known.  These are very basic decisions about genetic identity.  </p>  <p>  As Sweden did 20 years ago, we are moving to known donation.  It is the right practice.  If a child has the right to genetic information, procedures on how a child and parent can access that information will be established.  It is part of a continuum.  One part is moving from anonymous to known donation.  The second part is the issue of consent and making sure it is built into our legislation very clearly.  The next part is the regulation of all clinics so they adhere in a uniform way across the country to the provisions in this Bill and to the broader assisted human reproduction provisions to be developed by the Department of Health.</p><p>Access to information is part and parcel of the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

It deals with the area of assisted human reproduction and those rights.  It is a massive area.  The Minister knows that many people are not happy with current adoption rights, including a former Minister and colleague of the current Minister.  The process has been rushed at an indecent pace and the Bill is too big and complex to get around it in a year, not to say a month.

These arise out of the discussions on Committee Stage and refer to the circumstances where a donor may seek to have his or her identity kept from a donor-conceived child.  This gave rise to some concern that the identity rights of the child would not be properly safeguarded.  In light of those discussions, I have decided to further refine the provisions, and amendment No. 40 removes the reference to the &quot;well-being&quot; of the donor or donor-conceived child being affected.  This is too subjective a threshold, and a number of Deputies spoke about this on Committee Stage.  I am clarifying the highly exceptional nature of any decision to withhold donor information by providing that the information can be withheld only when it would affect the &quot;safety&quot; of the donor or the donor-conceived child.  I should stress that I consider it highly unlikely that information will ultimately be withheld on this basis but I consider it essential to ensure that the Minister for Health or the authority to be established has some means of dealing with any truly exceptional circumstances which may arise.</p><p>Amendment No. 41 makes further associated provision by clarifying that the Minister will have the scope to provide a donor-conceived child with the reasons for refusal.  If he does not, the court will be able to consider the contents of any representations made and determine whether, in the circumstances, the donor-conceived child should be given the information.  The strong presumption, as I mentioned to Deputy Shortall, based on the initial consents made by a donor, is that donor information will be released to a child.  If the Minister so decides, and the donor objects, he or she will have the usual right to apply to the courts for a review of that decision.</p><p>We had much discussion on Committee Stage about the terms and what may be exceptional circumstances.  In order to really make it clear that we see this as something extremely unusual and an exceptional circumstance, I was advised, legally, that I needed to include an exclusion in case there was a circumstance where the information would compromise the safety of the child.  I was advised that we should have this provision.  Even in the case of refusal, there is a right of appeal to the court.  The donor-conceived child or adult can go to court, which can obtain the information and make a determination in the usual way.</p></speech>

As I indicated, when the provisions are taken over by an authority, it would make that determination.  I am advised that it is essential to ensure that the Minister for Health would have some means of dealing with any truly exceptional circumstances that might arise.  We discussed in much detail how the court would get the information, given that the person has been refused information in the first instance.  Making the information available to the person defeats the point of having said "No" because of safety issues.  I have taken advice on the matter.  There is precedent with regard to adoption, for example, where the court makes the application to get the information and make a determination, as any court normally would.</p></speech>

It is envisaged, as assisted human reproduction legislation develops and during the course of the consultation, that there would be discussion of the exact type of authority that needs to be developed in order to oversee the area along with the Department of Health.</p></speech>

These are intended to address some of the concerns raised on Second Stage and further discussed on Committee Stage on the position of non-marital fathers.  There was some disagreement but many Deputies supported automatic guardianship.  Others spoke about supporting automatic guardianship but felt there should be exceptions but there was no agreement on what those exceptions should be, although Deputies raised the issues of domestic violence and rape, where fathers were not involved and the situation that would arise and the difficulties that would face the mother in those circumstances.  My aim, pending further policy analysis on automatic guardianship, is to provide better information to parents from the outset.  I take the point that was made on several occasions that many, particularly young, fathers are not aware that they can make a statutory declaration of fatherhood now and do not use that mechanism.  This set of amendments is designed to ensure that parents are aware of the option of statutory declarations and can easily avail of them.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 will delete certain elements required to make a statutory declaration making a non-marital father a guardian of his child.  Section 2(4)(<i>d</i>) of the 1964 Act provided that the parents of the child concerned must have made arrangements in relation to custody of, and access to, the child.  In general, parents will not make a statutory declaration unless they are on good terms, and possibly cohabiting in any case.  In such cases, the requirement for &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; to be made is not a useful or meaningful one.  Although the custody and access arrangements referred to do not need to be through formal written arrangements, removing the requirement to have such arrangements may be useful in removing a perceived barrier to making a statutory declaration when registering the child's birth.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, make the same change in relation to a statutory declaration to be made by cohabiting parents who have a child through donor-assisted human reproduction, and the same considerations apply.</p><p>These changes are a useful support to amendment No. 83.  Deputy Collins tabled an amendment on this issue.  My amendment is intended to provide better information to non-marital parents and to make it easier for fathers to become guardians of their children, where they are not cohabiting in a family unit.  The existing mechanism of making a statutory declaration is a simple and inexpensive one but there is insufficient awareness of its existence and many parents simply do not use it.  With approximately one third of births being outside marriage, it is important to ensure parents are aware of their rights and responsibilities and of how to secure them.  This amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004 is to achieve that aim.  Where the parents or either of them register the birth of their child, the registrar will give them a copy of the statutory declaration in order that they can consider whether to make a statutory declaration appointing the father or second parent as a guardian of the child, witnessed by the registrar.  They do not need to decide then and there.  They can jointly make the declaration, witnessed by the registrar, within two weeks of registering or re-registering the child&rsquo;s birth - my understanding is that at present the birth has to be registered within three months - that is, 14 days after that three months.  The couple decides when to register the birth and has 14 days after that, with the registrar to make the statutory declaration.  The couple does not have to make the declaration to the registrar and some couples may not.  The father may not undertake a statutory declaration for quite a long time after that and it is still completely open to the couple to make the statutory declaration in the usual format before a peace commissioner or commissioner of oaths.  The registrar will not charge any fee for witnessing the statutory declaration and we intend to ensure information is provided wherever births are registered about the statutory declaration.  Several Deputies said there was no information about the statutory declaration, whether in maternity hospitals or when the couple went to register the birth.  This makes it easier.  If the parents decide not to make the statutory declaration at that time, there is nothing to prevent their doing so at a later point.</p><p>This approach will ensure that from the commencement of these provisions, which will be without undue delay, non-marital parents will have the necessary information to decide jointly whether the father will be a guardian of the child.  Coupled with ensuring they have the necessary information, they will also be able to make the statutory declaration for free having had sufficient time to consider the decision.  Where a child&rsquo;s parents have been cohabiting for 12 months and have not taken steps to appoint the father as a guardian, other provisions of the Bill will ensure he becomes a guardian automatically.  It is in the Bill that there is automatic guardianship once the couple have been cohabiting for 12 months.  That provision remains, and in the case of those couples, the father is automatically the guardian, including three months after the birth of the child.</p><p>Amendment No. 48 is to clarify for avoidance of any doubt that the period of cohabitation for the automatic acquisition of guardianship commences from the date on which the legislation comes into effect.  In general, legislation is not retrospective, and in view of the rights and responsibilities which accrue on guardianship, there must be clarity as to whether there is any intention of creating retrospective rights.  Fathers who live with their partners and children and who are not guardians can, if they wish, secure those rights and responsibilities sooner, whether by means of making a statutory declaration or the option of applying to the court, which is still available to parents in that situation.</p><p>Amendment No. 56 makes the same clarification in respect of the automatic acquisition of guardianship by the cohabiting parent of a child born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  I have listened to the debate and moved to deal with certain issues.  This makes it far more likely that at the time of a birth, the natural father will assert his rights through the statutory declaration where a couple agrees with this and can do it when registering the birth.</p></speech>

Guardianship is given in many different places such as the courts and via the statutory declaration process.  A number of issues remain to be considered and a significant amount of work needs to be done in the future but I am not dealing with it in this legislation.  This is a first step in ensuring the registrar is in a position to witness the statutory declaration and ensure that parents avail of it at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and I appreciate that the Minister has put in an amendment to strengthen the area of statutory declarations.</p>  <p>  This is a serious debate and organisations such as Treoir have been to the forefront in highlighting the issue.  There is inequality as between a father and a mother as things stand.  There must be thousands of fathers out there who did not realise when they registered their name on the child's birth certificate that it did not automatically entitle them to guardianship.  One third of children are born to mothers who are not married, many of whom are very young and even teenagers.  We always tell young men to step up to the plate, to be a father, be a man and pay their maintenance.  We tell them to be there for their child and to support their child, even if they are not going to continue in a relationship with the mother.  Without this legislation being enacted, we will not have equality as a father's right to guardianship is subject to the consent of the mother.  This makes it an unequal relationship.  When a man proudly registers his name, he will be advised that it confers no entitlement to guardianship and that he should seek the agreement of the mother to a statutory declaration.  If the mother disagrees, however, it will end up in court.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that this provides a measure of safety but we should devise a system where people do not go down the road of going to court on these matters.  The registrar should be able to give the necessary information from the get-go.  The fact that a father is there means he wants to be there and wants to fulfil his responsibilities.  It is unfortunate that, with so many men walking away from their responsibilities, when a man actually turns up to accept his responsibility and wants his name on the register he cannot have equality.</p>  <p>  The point is sometimes made that in many cases men are not really equal parents because they do not share the parenting responsibilities.  Then there are the cases of domestic abuse and where a man who is not really a fit father likes the idea of calling himself a father without what comes with it and it is for these cases that there is an option to go to court.  </p>  <p>  This Bill is very welcome and long overdue.  The difficulty is that until we have reform of family law, a mediation Bill and investment in the court system we will have the spectacle of separated parents in packed courtrooms across the State, with all the stress that goes with that.  We will not have equality between a father and a mother, particularly in cases where a father steps up to the plate.  I do not think conditionality in the form of residency - what I have called "the co-habitance clause" - is fair because sometimes a father cannot live with a mother.  The mother may live with her parents if she is very young, or maybe the father has to work away from home so cannot comply with the need to live with her for three months after the child is born and nine other months.  It is unfortunate we have that requirement and I cannot agree to it so I will press my amendment today.  I do not assume I will get support from the Minister today but as we develop these debates through future legislation we can revisit the issue and ensure the overall system gives as many guarantees and protections as possible for the father, the mother and, most important, the child.</p></speech>

This is an extremely important debate and some issues that have been raised need a lot of debate.  The previous speaker said there was not equality between fathers and mothers.  He is dead right and we all know where most of the inequality lies.  It lies in the fact that one in five women is a victim of domestic violence.  One third of all parents are single parents, 90% of them mothers, and 50% of fathers do not pay any maintenance to those mothers.  It is on these matters that we need to legislate.</p>  <p>  How do we check if somebody has lived with somebody for 12 months?  It seems to be impossible to prove it.  Will a mother have the right to revoke guardianship based on the fact that it is automatic?  What about those women who are fleeing domestic violence and who may have lived with a violent man for a number of years?  I had a woman in my clinic on Monday morning in such a situation.  </p>  <p>  Custody is very clearly laid out in the law in front of us but a lot of people confuse custody with guardianship.  If a man wants to be a man and a father then custody and access are surely the key things he will want and he will be able to prove he is a father in that way.  However, the problem with guardianship is that a man who was violent towards his partner would still have the right to dictate where that woman lives because residency is part of guardianship.  He can prevent the children getting access to passports to leave the country.  There are major repercussions for women in those situations and there are quite a large number of such women.  </p>  <p>  Violence against women is at epidemic levels around the globe and it is understated in this country.  One in four women in Europe is a sufferer and I doubt more women are being abused in Europe than Ireland.  </p>  <p>  How will the checks of the 12 year residency criteria be carried out?  I do not believe in any case that this proves a person is a good father. </p><p>Will the woman have a right to challenge guardianship after the father has claimed automatic right to be a guardian?</p></speech>

There is an ongoing inquiry, for example, into child abuse in Northern Ireland.  We have had many inquiries here and many commissions of inquiry in the Republic.  One need only recall Cloyne, Ferns and Dublin, to give a number of examples.</p>  <p>  Everyone in this House was very clear in terms of condemning that abuse and in condemning anybody who would have been complicit in the cover up of that abuse.  I am particularly mindful of the very strong and strident comments of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  Back in 2009, which was a significant year, as we know now, in the context of the report of abuse in the Dublin diocese, she said that anyone, including garda&iacute;, found to be complicit in the cover-up of child abuse must be arrested and made to face the full rigours of the law.  She also made other significant comments on that occasion.  If one substituted the words "Sinn F&eacute;in leadership" or Sinn F&eacute;in authorities" for the words "the church", "garda&iacute;" or "others", I wonder would people come to the same conclusion in terms of what should happen.</p>  <p>  Suffice to say that allegations were ignored across the board for too long and many people were emotionally scarred and traumatised as a result.  One of the big issues for many people in those abuse scandals was the fear of coming forward, the fear of being stigmatised and, above all, the fear of not being believed and being undermined by those who would have abused them.</p>  <p>  When the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill episode occurred we saw similar patterns emerging of attempts to undermine her credibility, and an online campaign was launched against her undermining her character and so on.  This week we have had the heartbreaking account of Paudie McGahon's story on the "Spotlight" programme on Tuesday night.  He gained the courage to tell his story, and Ma&iacute;ria Cahill telling her story was the trigger for him to go public on the issue.  Both of their actions have encouraged others to come forward.  Fundamentally, the people want justice and the truth.  It is very important that we be clear that there is a responsibility on all involved to obey the law and to respond to the legal requirements.  I was struck by the fact that on LMFM yesterday, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Adams, when asked whether it was not a breach of the Children First guidelines - whose aim is to protect children - not to report this, made an extraordinary comment to the effect that, first of all, in order for a statement to be made to the Garda, someone needs to substantiate it.</p></speech>

There are two elements to this: there is the issue of a criminal investigation, and the issue of reporting this to the HSE, at the time, and now to Tusla. There is a fundamental issue with regard to protecting children right now.  Those who abused people are still at large and could abuse others within their families, neighbourhoods or communities.</p>  <p>  The fundamental point I want to put to the Minister is this.  Given the fact that we have faced up to this before with regard to different institutions, I ask the Government to give serious consideration to establishing a commission of inquiry into the allegations of the "Spotlight" programme and wider issue of how Sinn F&eacute;in as an entity dealt with allegations of child abuse.  We know from the events in Ferns and Cloyne that where co-operation is forthcoming, these inquiries can be expeditious and efficient and can get to the truth of the matter.  That can happen where there is co-operation, full disclosure and the provision of information to such a commission of inquiry.  There are different ways of doing that, and it is time we had such a commission.</p></speech>

I agree with him on the points he made, particularly the important point that anybody who has information should bring it forward to the relevant authorities, whether that be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla or the HSE.  There is an obligation on anybody who feels that children are at risk in any way and has information to suggest that children at risk to bring it forward.  Certainly, the courage of Ma&iacute;ria Cahill and Paudie McGahon in coming forward will give other people the courage to do so as well.  That has been the general experience when programmes such as the "Spotlight" programme have been shown.  A representative from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre interviewed on radio this morning indicated that they have had an increased number of calls.  Therefore, it is vital that information is provided by anyone who has it.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there are questions to be answered by Sinn F&eacute;in in regard to the information it has, particularly in regard to people who may be abroad in our society, whether in this country or elsewhere, and are a risk to children.  The Children First guidelines and all the various measures that have been implemented give clear guidance as to what should be done. </p>  <p>   I would also question Deputy Adams in particular regarding what he said - namely, that he needed more substantial information.  If a person has any concerns that children are at risk, then he or she should go to the Garda.  There are certainly questions to be answered.  There are particular questions as well about another matter.  As has been admitted, there were "internal inquiries", if I can use that nice phrase; "kangaroo courts" is another term that is used.</p></speech>

There is certainly an onus on Sinn F&eacute;in to give the information to the appropriate people.  That is the first obligation and it is a very serious one.  Many members of Sinn F&eacute;in and others in this House have frequently raised issues to do with child protection - Deputy Martin rightly raised this issue - and those are issues we all take very seriously.  This Government and, I acknowledge, previous Governments have put many measures in place.  We cannot be concerned only about child abuse that occurred in the past in institutions.

I have talked to people in the child law area.  There is a duty defined in legislation and interpreted in case law to be proactive in their investigation of allegations of abuse for the purpose of protecting children from potential abuse now or into the future.  </p> <p> A question that would have to be asked, for example, is where are those alleged perpetrators now?  These people exiled this person in 2002 in the full knowledge that the person had committed abuse not just to Paudie McGahon, but to others.  The bottom line is what access did that perpetrator and others have to children in their daily lives through family or employment?</p></speech>

The group was recently formed and has over 100,000 members currently.  They met a group of TDs and Senators yesterday to express their views on the continuing demise of rural Ireland and the need for Government policy to halt this downward slide.  They are highlighting the issues currently affecting the social and economic development of rural Ireland and they are seeking a change in Government policies in several issues pertaining to rural decline.  At the presentation to Oireachtas Members and to the media yesterday, the group reflected on many issues similar to those raised in Richard Curran's outstanding documentary programme on Monday night last on RTE1.  The programme, aptly titled "The Battle for Rural Ireland," depicted the plight of rural areas and their fight to survive.  The group's representatives sense that the rural community has gone to the edge of the cliff.  They have got to the stage at which they are prepared to fight and resist being given the final push out over the cliff and into the abyss of no return.  That is the reality facing the countryside at present.</p>  <p>  Almost a decade of recession and recession policies and politics has taken a huge toll on these rural areas, and the group has identified a number of key issues which need immediate attention.  Will the Government address in what remains of its lifetime a number of these items that were brought before us yesterday?</p>  <p>  There is need for a regional spread in job creation.  At present, three quarters of all jobs are going into Dublin and other principal cities, and this cannot be allowed to continue.  The Government needs to accelerate the roll-out of broadband and ensure the viability of post offices and other services.  Some GP services in rural areas are being discontinued due to retirements, etc.  We need to get back our doctors from abroad and ensure there are services in remote rural areas.  There are several such cases at present.  The issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes is topical.</p>  <p>  Finally, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on what she has achieved in government in changing the system for school enrolment.  This would mean the retention of a significant number of teachers as well as the recruitment of a number of additional teachers.  I will give her credit; she has rural Ireland in her heart.  Perhaps she will take these matters to Cabinet.</p></speech>

The Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs, Deputy Ann Phelan.  She works across the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and is doing an effective job in raising these issues and giving them importance in government.  In fact, she attended Cabinet last week to discuss one of the issues about which Deputy Tom Fleming is concerned.</p><p> I thank the Deputy for his compliments concerning the issue of smaller schools.  We have a very good programme in place to alleviate the situation for schools that were at risk of losing teachers, recognising in particular isolated rural schools that are 8 km or more from the nearest school.  We have also been engaging with local communities where enrolment numbers are dropping.  This is an example of an action that Government has taken to address issues of serious concern in rural areas.  Another is the announcement of the Leader programme by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, in recent days.  Leader is an extremely important programme for rural Ireland.  The most recent announcements pertaining to the Action Plan for Jobs by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, also had a strong regional dimension.  The latest plan stresses the importance of ensuring that jobs are created in rural Ireland and in those parts of the country that have not benefited from the economic recovery that we are now seeing, particularly along the east coast and in Dublin.  The Department of Social Protection has ensured that post offices in general and rural post offices in particular are used to provide many of its services and payments to the public.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, is working on the roll-out of broadband which is extremely important in rural areas, especially for those trying to run small businesses.</p></speech>

I read recent media reports on the group to which he referred, and Government is happy to work with its members and with all of the Deputies in this House who represent rural constituencies to ensure that rural Ireland remains a priority.</p></speech>

This has not been done to date and the approach has been a bit scattered and fragmented.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, the very best and believe that she has one of the most responsible positions in Government.  Several glaring deficiencies have been raised with Deputies representing rural Ireland, and there is a need for collective responsibility in Cabinet to address them.  Some of the issues I raised pertain to various Departments, and the Cabinet will have to wake up and focus on the areas that need to be addressed urgently.  In that context, I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, is entitled to sit at the Cabinet table, as was done in the past with other Ministers of State.  I cannot recollect the details precisely but during the time of the so-called rainbow Government, a Minister of State was elevated to Cabinet.  I ask that this be done immediately in the case of the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  I compliment Mr. Pat Spillane on the sterling work he has done and also Mr. Edmond Harty from Dairymaster, a very successful rural company.  The recommendations in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas could be very effective if they were implemented properly.  I hope the Government will give local partnerships the responsibility they deserve because they have delivered high-quality service under the Leader programme.  I welcome the new Leader programme that has been introduced and I hope that the role of the partnerships will not be diluted.

Small rural schools would be an example of one of the issues about which I have had intensive discussions with her.</p>  <p>  On the issue of Ministers of State sitting at the Cabinet table, apart from the Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, attends Cabinet meetings alongside his senior Minister, Deputy Bruton, because the Government has made jobs one of its top priorities.  As Deputy Fleming said in his opening remarks, job creation is crucial in rural Ireland.  We need to build on the strengths of different parts of the country to provide jobs for people near their homes.  Having two Ministers from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the Cabinet table is significant.  Whoever is in Government after the next general election will decide which areas should be given priority in the context of seats at the Cabinet table.</p></speech>

She should stand back from the issue and engage with the teaching profession on the issue of independent assessment and the best methodology to use to develop the talents and intelligence of young people.  That is an important issue which is being lost because of how this debate has been conducted over the past two years.  There is the issue of the lack of independent assessment, and we must be clear about that.  By visiting rural schools, one can see how closely knit communities are, which raises substantial issues that are being dismissed too readily.  Teachers have a valid point on this issue because the one good thing about our State examination system is that, irrespective of background, students get fair treatment.  It is one of the few systems in the country about which we can say that influence or knowing someone in the parish, the golf club, the GAA club, the rugby club and so forth will have no impact on the outcome or result.  There are legitimate and substantive issues.  There are also legitimate issues about how we teach and learn.</p><p>I accept that.  There have been reforms through the years, such as different forms of the leaving certificate, namely the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational.  I would like to know when the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be published.  It would be good if people stood back from all this because it is not going go anywhere the way it is being handled.  Ramming it through will not be effective because curricular change ultimately needs the full engagement and participation of stakeholders.  The key dynamic in the classroom is the one between the teacher and the child which is central to the successful roll-out of change.</p> <p> My second question relates to the proposed education Bill.  Recent parliamentary replies have suggested that the concept of an independent ex quota provision for careers guidance counselling will never return to schools.  The Minister has said that more or less in parliamentary replies to my colleague.  Is this the position and is careers guidance something that will never return to the classroom to the degree and scale that pertained before the Government's decision to abolish ex quota careers guidance counsellors, which removed 1,000 teachers from the system?  Deputy McConalogue has been persistent in pursuing this issue with the Minister for the past year or more and the responses have become more alarming in the sense of it being all about the school community but with no additional resources being given.  All the lip service to mental health and the challenges young people face in schools and society-----</p></speech>

In respect of the junior cycle, which is not part of that Bill, I have had 40 hours of discussions with teaching unions.  An independent chairperson whose name was proposed by the unions put forward what he considered to be fair proposals and the unions have still withdrawn from consideration.  I believe we need this reform.  While the Deputy says we have a fair system, it is fair at assessing what a person can write in a written examination at the end of three years but it is not fair to all students because it does not assess a variety of strengths that young people have nowadays.  I also have a duty to the other partners in education such as the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, the National Parents Council and the management bodies who want us to move forward with this reform.</p>  <p>  The particular concern I have with the Deputy's contribution is that he seems to be suggesting that teachers are so unprofessional that they would not be able to carry out this assessment without being intimidated into making decisions that are not in the best interests of students.  I very much respect and value the professionalism of teachers, as does the rest of the country.  They are held in very high regard.  This reform has been proposed for a long time and we need to move it forward in the interests of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned resources for careers guidance, referred to my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, and suggested that he handled this badly.  I reject that contention.  The reason my predecessor had to cut funding in the Department of Education and Skills, as all other Ministers had to cut funding, was because of the way the economy was left to them when they came into Government.  It was inevitable that funds would be cut from the education budget.</p></speech>

It is important that all Members are given an opportunity to contribute to the debate on that legislation to ensure that, when enacted, it provides tough sanctions for non-reporting of child abuse, which enables people who carry out this heinous crime to continue to prey on vulnerable children.

I note that the Minister has recently indicated that the only way schools can be assured of funding from the Department of Education and Skills is if they decide to amalgamate or, as she put it, voluntarily come together.</p>  <p>  On the POD, perhaps the Minister would tell the House whether she has received an assurance from the Data Protection Commissioner that it is in line with legislation.  Also, how can she stand over asking schools to collect information from parents when she or the Department had not up to now ensured that the system complied with data protection legislation?</p></speech>

I have no problem asking that such a debate be organised.  I want to reiterate that while the report has been published, the Government has not made any decision to implement any element of it and does not intend to implement anything other than what has already been implemented in regard to small schools, which has been widely welcomed countrywide.</p>  <p>  With regard to the database, we have had a secondary database for years, which gathers the same type of information and is very useful in terms of planning literacy and numeracy strategies and so on.  We are in continuous conversation with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that anything that we do with regard to the primary database is in compliance with our obligations with regard to data protection.  It should be recognised at post primary level that this is a very useful tool which is designed to improve the educational opportunities for children.</p></speech>

There are similar schemes in place in the United States for undocumented Irish people.  The difficulty is that, to access those schemes, the undocumented Irish must return to Ireland to have a visa issued to them, which means they are then hit with a three-year or ten-year ban for having been illegally resident in the United States.  A waiver system has been introduced in Mexico.  The introduction of a similar waiver system here would address the problem for about one third of the undocumented Irish in the US.  I understand a letter has issued from the Government to the US ambassador in regard to the establishment of such a waiver scheme here.  When was that letter sent to the ambassador?  Does it formally request the lifting of the visa ban and the introduction of a waiver scheme here to address this anomaly for the undocumented Irish in the US?</p></speech>

Senators and Governors have been in contact with Deputies in this House to inform them of their concerns about Ireland's attempt to reduce tobacco consumption.

Its intention is to rectify a defect in the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  I spoke at length to the previous Minister for Justice and Equality about the difficulty with said Act.  At least one local authority, if not more, has been asked for its view on the matter.  The difficulty concerns the definition of a multi-unit development.  The flaw in the legislation means that any development of more than five houses is deemed to be a multi-unit development, which imposes on it a requirement to introduce a management company.  That is the way local authorities are interpreting the legislation.  Instead of resolving issue, the legislation is posing new difficulties.  The issue is a simple one and relates to definition.  Essentially, the Bill seeks that a structure requiring a management company would be a multi-unit development with one roof over it.  I got a solicitor to help me to draft the wording and I hope it is sufficiently robust.</p><p>Management companies have been a very difficult issue for people to resolve.  Prior to the crash, when people arrived at a solicitor's office to get the keys of their new home, they were told to sign for them and were advised that it was just a matter of form.  They then discovered that they were part of a management company that placed an annual financial obligation on them.  I do not refer to situations where a management company is required but to traditional housing developments.  Management companies are very difficult to unwind as they are framed according to company law, which gives rise to difficulty when a local authority takes an estate in charge.  Many local authorities are concerned that only one entity would be involved in the management of the estate, which means the management company must be wound down.</p><p>I recently published a booklet to help people to unpick the issue as it is a complex area.  I would prefer not to introduce the Bill.  I would prefer if the change could be made by way of amendment to the legislation as a matter of urgency.  The very least we should do is not to make things difficult for people.  Local authorities are starting to get new development proposals and new planning applications are being made to them.  The difficulty is that the planning applications will have a requirement for a management company when there is no need for one.  This will cause considerable administrative problems in the future, which will result in needless extra expense.  It is a relatively simple matter to ensure that does not happen.  I hope the Government will address the issue in advance of the Bill even having an airing.</p></speech>

This agency, to be known as the fuel smuggling forum, would bring together all the statutory agencies for detecting and policing the illicit fuel trade, North and South.</p><p>Fuel smuggling and the criminal activity which runs in tandem with it is a cancer affecting many areas along the Border.  It impacts negatively on communities, North and South, posing not only an environmental threat, but also a severe criminal one by strengthening the dangerous and violent elements which are involved with this illegal trade.  I commend the work of the investigative journalists who have clearly identified paramilitaries, among others, as being involved in this trade.</p><p>The environmental consequences of fuel laundering have been widely reported in areas along the Border.  The material produced as a consequence of removing green dye from diesel is highly toxic and has the potential to damage public drinking water supplies.  The fuel laundering industry also spawns broader criminality such as illicit cigarette smuggling and trade in other counterfeit products.  </p><p>The Bill builds on the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I commend the work of the assembly's committee which produced an important report on this issue.  The report's recommendations include the imposition of more serious penalties, including lengthier custodial sentences for illicit activities, on the individuals and gangs involved in these criminal activities.</p><p>The fuel smuggling forum to be established through this legislation would consist of a director general and seven other officers appointed in accordance with the legislation.  Three officers would be appointed to the forum by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and would consist of an officer each from the Environmental Protection Agency and Office of the Revenue Commissioners and a chief superintendent nominated by the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister, in consultation with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, would also be enabled to appoint the following to be officers of the forum: an officer each from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and revenue service, a chief superintendent from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and an officer from the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. </p><p>The forum, in carrying out its work, would be provided with the relevant information by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  This information would pertain to fuel smuggling and other organised criminal activity in the Border region.  It is proposed that the forum, within six months after the end of the preceding year, would prepare an annual report specifying its activities and submit same to the Minister.  The director general would be required to attend a meeting of the joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas whenever asked to do so by the committee and to provide relevant information.</p><p>As a representative of two Southern Border counties, I am particularly conscious of the criminal activity involved in fuel smuggling and other illicit trade.  The proposal I put before the House is to ensure these issues are dealt with comprehensively.  They can only be solved through more effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law.  Bringing together in one forum or body the statutory agencies whose remit is to deal with these activities is clearly the way forward in dealing with a problem that has grown significantly in recent years.</p><p>We are all well aware of the large volumes of laundered diesel and, in more recent times, stretched petrol that are being traded much further afield than the Border region.  The many negative aspects to these activities include a substantial loss of revenue to the State and a similar loss in Northern Ireland.  It was recently estimated that upwards of &euro;260 million is lost to the State annually through illegal fuel smuggling.  Small traders also have a genuine grievance because their business is being eroded through illicit trade.  Individual motorists also incur substantial costs when, in good faith, they purchase product without knowing it has been contaminated, resulting in high repair costs for engines and other vehicle parts.</p><p>On many Border roads, in particular, we witness fuel spillages which create hazards for motorists and may have caused many accidents over the years.  Local authorities incur substantial expenditure every year cleaning up these spillages.  We must also consider the overall damage to the environment caused by fuel laundering.  We have all seen, either in person or in photographs, cubes of sludge dumped by roadsides and in ditches.  This sludge is a by-product of the bleaching agents and sulphuric acid used in laundering diesel.  The outcome of this process is that toxic waste is dumped in our countryside, posing serious dangers to our waterways, public drinking water supplies and public health in general and threatens the provenance and authenticity of our agricultural production system.</p><p>We need the new cross-Border multi-agency task force I propose to deal in the most comprehensive manner possible with the scourge that is being inflicted on so many communities, one which has impacted on the lives of genuine traders and innocent motorists and continues to rob the State of much-needed revenue.  Our response to these despicable activities must be enhanced to rid society of this illicit trade and deny the criminals involved their ill-gotten gains.  </p></speech>

I accept that it is a first step and that the Minister has listened to some of the comments on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is not good enough, however, that the Minister does not go further in this regard.  This legislation is extensive and complex.  It goes to incredible lengths to provide for protection for people who find themselves in situations where, for all kinds of different reasons, they are parents of children.  The Bill goes out of its way to confer rights on people in all kinds of situations where the State deems a person to be the parent of a child.  To some extent, the Bill could be criticised for bringing about a situation where parents will now be whoever the State decides they are.  It raises all kinds of other issues which, unfortunately, we have not had time to delve into or discuss.</p>  <p>  One glaring omission of this Bill relates to where there is no question about the genetic parentage of a child in respect of the father and where both parents are agreed on the matter.  It is undoubtedly the case that good public policy would provide for automatic guardianship in those situations.  In fact, one would have to ask why it is that the State would not provide for automatic guardianship in those situations.  Whatever about historical situations, I cannot understand how such a provision in legislation in 2015 would not be open to contest in the courts because of refusing or failing to provide for automatic guardianship in these circumstances.  I do not understand why the Minister is not prepared to address that.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister has been quite disingenuous, as have others as well, in raising the issue of domestic violence as some kind of defence for not providing for automatic guardianship for unmarried fathers.  Regrettably, domestic violence is all too common in this country, but it is certainly not the preserve of unmarried fathers.  It is wrong for the issue to be raised in that context.  Clearly, there are several situations or circumstances in which a father or mother may not be the best person to have guardianship of a particular child.  However, those decisions should be taken elsewhere case by case basis and not on the basis of someone's marital status.  Again, I am unsure how this could possibly stand up to any kind of legal challenge.</p>  <p>  On what basis is the Minister suggesting that simply because a father of a child is married he has automatic rights, whereas the father of a child who is not married does not enjoy those rights?  It seems to be fundamental that someone in that situation, a person who is the father or the mother of a child, should have automatic guardianship rights, unless it is one of those rare circumstances where that is not in the child's best interests.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of this must be those fundamental rights, as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides for every child to know and be cared for, as far as practicable, by both parents.  If we subscribe to the UN Convention, as I assume the Minister does, then what on earth can the rationale be for denying automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers?  I simply do not understand it.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say to us in 2015 that we have taken the first step and that we will see about the other steps later.  That is simply not acceptable.  The Minister is providing for all kinds of other situations, including setting down the legal parameters of parentage in many different unusual and new circumstances, whereas she fails to address this issue.  It has been with us for a long time and the Minister knows it has been an issue for a long time.  Despite this, the Minister is not taking the opportunity of this legislation to deal with that.</p>  <p>  This is not only about the right of the child; it is about the rights and responsibilities of fathers.  We see too often unmarried fathers being blacklisted or dismissed as not important in their children's lives.  Negative messages come out at an official level about unmarried fathers, and that needs to be changed urgently.  It is the case that where we expect a lot from someone, they tend to give a lot, but if we expect little from people, they will give little.  There is an official attitude to unmarried fathers to the effect that they are not important, that they should not be around, that they are not necessary and so on.  That type of negative attitude is very much reinforced through our social welfare and tax legislation as well as social policy in other areas.  There are fundamental issues around the rights of the child but also around the rights of fathers which are not being catered for in this legislation.  That is a serious omission.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to explain the basis on which she is discriminating between fathers who are married and fathers who happen to be unmarried.  In effect, that is what the Minister is doing.  I call on the Minister to provide justification for that, because I do not believe there is any justification, and, if not, I urge the Minister to address this matter comprehensively in the legislation.  The Minister knows it will be a considerable time before the Government revisits this area of family law.  The Minister should not leave a glaring omission.</p>  <p>  Other aspects of what the Minister proposes require more exploration, for example, the question of establishing guardianship.  I am unsure why the Minister has amended the Bill to make it operative from the date of the passage of this legislation.  If it is good practice that certain rules should relate to guardianship, then I do not see why children who were born last month or last year cannot enjoy whatever limited benefits have been conveyed by this Bill.</p><p> I also ask the Minister to explain why she came up with this figure of 12 months.  On what basis does 12 months convey rights of paternity?  I would also ask her to explain how it will be possible to establish that there has been cohabitation for 12 months.  She referred to amendment No. 83, but that does not go anywhere near far enough, in my view, and while it is a start, it is not adequate.  Why does the Minister not provide for the registrar to be required to inform fathers about their rights in regard to making a declaration?  It would have been very easy to state that the registrar "shall" inform fathers of their entitlement to make a statutory declaration.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not done that.</p> <p> The Bill states that the registrar may take and receive a statutory declaration.  How does a registrar receive a statutory declaration?  Is the Minister suggesting that the registrar will be given a statutory declaration?  What does the registrar then do with it?  Does he or she lodge it somewhere?  Is any record of that kept anywhere?  It would seem from the Minister's earlier comments that she does not intend to do that.</p> <p> The Minister in this legislation goes to considerable lengths to provide for the additional information that will be added to a birth certificate where a person was born as a result of assisted human reproduction, and to outline how all of that is going to be worked out.  If there are registers for that kind of information, why on earth would we not provide for a register for statutory declarations in regard to guardianship?  That just seems to be standard good practice.  The Minister mentioned something about the difficulties involved.  I cannot understand how there could be difficulties.  It is a straightforward thing.  A legal document is declared, yet no record of it is kept.  Will the Minister explain to us why she is not providing for a record?  It is very disappointing that the Minister has not paid heed to the representations that have been made to her in this regard.  I believe she is leaving the State open to a legal challenge by not doing that, but, more importantly, she is leaving children of unmarried parents in that legal limbo where a child's right to know and be cared for by both parents is not actually being upheld by the State.  Equally, she is providing for a situation in which fathers, in cases in which paternity is not in dispute and the man is the undisputed genetic father of a child, are being denied the rights and responsibilities of good fathers simply on the basis that they have not cohabited with their partners.  I cannot see any logic in that provision and I cannot see how it could possibly stand up to any kind of challenge.</p> <p> I would be very interested in hearing the Minister's explanation on all of those questions.  Hopefully, we can get some kind of commitment that she might address this lacuna in the law when the Bill gets to the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200027#Z00200"><p>I also raised this issue on Second Stage.  Obviously, my comments come in the context of general support for this Bill, which is a very welcome Bill that acknowledges the reality of diverse family relations in our society today.  However, the issue of unmarried fathers having to pass a criterion of having lived with the mother for 12 consecutive months, including for three months after the birth of the child, is very arbitrary and does not make any particular sense.  While I apologise for not having been here earlier, I would be most interested to hear the Minister's justification for this.</p>  <p>  Obviously, there are circumstances involving a father from whom the mother of the child is separated, or with whom she never had any long-term relationship, where the mother may believe there are reasons he should not have automatic guardianship, and I certainly think we have to allow for that in some way.  However, on the other hand, in the vast majority of cases fathers and mothers, married or unmarried - the parents - want to play a full part in bringing up their kids.  I do not believe we should start from a presumption that any category of parent has to have extra hoops to jump through in order to benefit from automatic guardianship.</p>  <p>  If the Minister needs to put in safeguards which allow a mother to debar a father whom she thinks might be, for example, a threat to a child or to herself from having guardianship, then such provisions obviously need to exist and may be spelt out explicitly.  Obviously, people can go to the courts, and the best interests of the child are firmly established in the Bill.  However, I do not see why the Minister has this particular category and these fairly arbitrary criteria when, probably in the majority of cases, there is no difficulty with an unmarried father who does not happen to fit these criteria having automatic guardianship.  I say that as an unmarried father myself.  I think I would probably just about fit these criteria, so I think I would pass.  However, a person could be on the borderline.  It is very arbitrary.  I would like to hear the Minister's response and I hope she will be open-minded in how she deals with this when it moves to the Seanad in order to take on board these concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200027#Z00300"><p>First, I want to apologise for any confusion I caused earlier.  I had picked up the Committee Stage amendments by accident - <i>mea culpa</i>.</p><p>I very much agree with the points made by Deputies Shortall, Boyd Barrett and Mac Lochlainn.  What I would say that is a little different is that I accept progress is being made in this legislation in that more unmarried fathers will qualify for guardianship than would otherwise have qualified if the legislation had not been passed, which is welcome.  I also welcome the changes the Minister is making through amendment No. 83, which is very significant and on which I will have questions later.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is still very discriminatory.  Our law as it stands is very discriminatory, and this continues in that mould.  It is particularly discriminatory against younger fathers.  The idea that 19 year old parents would have to live together is just not the reality of the situation.  Very often a family decision is made, including the grandparents, that the parents will not live together and that they will continue with their education, for example.  Another point is that younger people are more vulnerable, more impressionable and more influenced by what their parents might decide for them.</p><p>In that regard, I was watching a programme last night in which people are helped to trace their parents who gave them up for adoption.  There was a case in which a woman of 46 met her father for the first time.  Basically, when he was 20 he was not really given any option to keep his child and the decision was very much taken for him and the mother of the child.  We are very much perpetuating that treatment of young unmarried fathers with this legislation.</p><p>Another point is the societal problems that have been identified.</p><p>Young unmarried fathers are pushed away for many different reasons, including cultural reasons, the way our social welfare system operates and so on.</p> <p> The idea that unmarried fathers would have to live with mothers is a very morally judgmental way of approaching the issue.  It is not applied to any other type of parent or guardian in current legislation or the Bill.  To say that a father must live with the mother for a certain period of time is a moral standpoint.  I have problems with that.</p> <p> The Law Reform Commission recommended going much further than this Bill and, with some qualifications, giving automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers.  That has been done in other countries.  I am aware of jurisdictions where if a father is registered on a child's birth certificate, he gets automatic guardianship rights.  That is what the Bill should state.  </p> <p> Court cases, including at EU level, have highlighted injustices over the years, such as the fact that unmarried fathers have not been consulted about adoption.  It is one of the rights and responsibilities that comes with guardianship, which is delineated in an amendment proposed by the Minister.  The fact that an unmarried father would not be consulted on an adoption because he does not have guardianship status is a very significant problem.  </p> <p> I understand from what Deputy Boyd Barrett said that this is not retrospective.  The Minister said one of the amendments is to make the criteria about living with the mother for 12 consecutive months clear.  It does not apply retrospectively.  For example, the law will not change the situation pertaining to an unmarried father who has lived with a mother for 20 years.  There are no new options in the Bill for such unmarried fathers.  What is being done for such people?  There are men who may have lived with mothers for a long period of time, but no longer do so.  If the Bill is not retrospective, how will such men be catered for?  What advice did the Minister receive?  Was it that the Bill cannot be retrospective?  Can anything be done retrospectively for people who will not get the benefits of this Bill?  </p> <p> I refer to Deputy Coppinger's points.  She spoke about domestic violence, which is to tar everyone with the same brush.  Most people are not violent.</p></speech>

That should not be used against everybody.  She said a particular phenomenon should be used to rule out a right for everybody.  As Deputy Shortall said, does she have evidence that unmarried fathers are more likely than married fathers to be violent?  What does evidence does she have to back up her claim?  I am not aware of any such evidence.</p>  <p>  Many other types of guardians, other than parents, are mentioned in the Bill.  The same criteria being applied to unmarried fathers is not being applied to them.  Certain criteria are being applied because of marital status, something with which I have a problem.  </p>  <p>  I asked whether the Bill could be retrospective and what was being done for people who will not receive retrospective recognition.  I welcome amendment No. 83.  If a registrar receives declarations, will he or she be able to keep them?  Will they be recorded in any way?  How will such records be kept?  I see no provision for such things in the Bill.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall made a good point.  The discourse in society is about equality, which is very welcome, but not if one is an unmarried father.  In such cases, equality is not even being argued for, apart from individuals in the Chamber and those outside who are very much in the minority.  The issue is not, as far as I can see, being debated in the media.  There is one group we seem to think against which it is fine to discriminate, namely, unmarried fathers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200028#AA00600"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions on this topic, which was a key part of the discussion on Second Stage.  As I said, I have taken action in a number of the amendments I tabled to make it easier for fathers to get information on the statutory declaration which is, in effect, the mechanism by which non-marital fathers can assert their guardianship rights at the current time.  We know that many do not.</p>  <p>  Constitutional protection for the family refers to a family based on marriage.  To some degree, the provisions of the Bill reflect the existing constitutional protection for marital fathers and are the consequence of legal advice.  Equally, we are discussing statutory declarations, which I accept.</p>  <p>  The complexities of this debate are illustrated by the comments of Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Coppinger on automatic guardianship for fathers, which captured some of the issues in the Bill.  Where a father has ongoing and real involvement in his child's life, it is very important to ensure he can be the child's guardian.  That is why the Bill already extends automatic guardianship to fathers living in a family unit with the child's mother and the child. </p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that information is more readily available to parents and it will be much easier to make statutory declarations, appointing the father as a guardian.  The Bill, and what I will introduce, will substantially improve the position of many non-marital fathers who are actively and meaningfully involved in their children's lives, regardless of the relationship with the child's mother, to pick up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's point.  We know there can be conflict.</p>  <p>  I understand the point made on automatic guardianship in all cases.  There are a range of issues.</p></speech>

I do not agree that a father should have to live with a mother to gain guardianship.  The law does not state that.  I do not agree with the provision and I have raised questions about it because it is arbitrary and gives extra rights to somebody who lived with a woman, but that does not mean he is a suitable father.  My problem is with a whole raft of Deputies arguing that there should be automatic guardianship in every case.</p><p>I do not agree with that, and I will explain why.  Any father can make a statutory declaration that he is a guardian, and he does not have to live with somebody for a year to do so.  It has been proposed by some Deputies that extra rights are earned if a person lives with a partner for a year, but that is not true.  The Minister has indicated that she will make the statutory declaration a bigger issue, and I agree with Deputies that this has not been discussed enough.  There are many people in this position, so it should have been debated more, and it is a little disappointing that the media have not taken more of an interest.</p> <p> I have never said that somebody who is unmarried is more likely to commit domestic violence.  I made the point that just because a person has lived with a woman for a year, there should not be an automatic right to guardianship.  Many of the one in five women who, according to Women's Aid, experience domestic violence in this country will now be put in a very difficult position because the man who abused them, and possibly their children, will have guardianship.  We put down amendments, which unfortunately were ruled out of order.  There should be conditions relating to guardianship.  For example, Women's Aid called for a rebuttal presumption to be introduced relating to custody, and the same goes for guardianship.</p></speech>

Will she do so?  In the context of the 12-month period, how is cohabitation established?  The Minister also stated that information will be "readily available".  I do not know what that means.  As far as I can see, the Bill or the amendments do not provide for information to be made available, and that is why I have suggested an amendment that the registrar of births "shall be required to inform" people of their rights to make a statutory declaration.  There is woolly stuff there about information being made available, and this needs to be set down in law.  Just as provisions have been set down that the registrar must inform people that there is additional information on the issue we discussed earlier, why can this not be done for parents with regard to the right to make a statutory declaration?</p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the Minister will not provide for a record of statutory declarations.  How does a person who has made a statutory declaration establish that as the case five years afterwards if he happens to have mislaid the declaration?  Why can a register not be provided?  An important point was made by Deputy Tuffy that unmarried fathers' rights are frequently overlooked when it comes to adoption.  That is a major problem, which was a feature of a recent legal case in which somebody with no blood relationship with the child ended up having superior rights to the genetic father of the child.  Given that the Law Reform Commission and the special rapporteur, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, have both clearly recommended automatic guardianship, why is their advice being ignored?</p></speech>

There is no reason to believe a father who is the parent and happens to be married is any more suitable for automatic guardianship than an unmarried father.  The opposite could just as easily be true.  In other words, the unmarried father might in some circumstances be more suitable.</p></speech>

Just because somebody happens to be the father and happens to be married to the mother - or was married to the mother - does not make him any more suitable for automatic guardianship than an unmarried father.  One can argue for conditions, but they would apply to both groups.  There is a distinction being made between married and unmarried fathers, with one seen as automatically suitable for guardianship while the other is not.  That does not make any sense and is completely arbitrary.  If we think there should be conditions, we could indicate that the father of the child should get automatic guardianship as long as there is no reasonable objection made by the mother.  That would be regardless of whether they are married, as bringing marriage into the process is discriminatory.  It harks back to all the stuff that we have been trying to deal with.</p></speech>

Many of the people who have suffered domestic violence are married and have husbands.  That is agreed by everybody.  Nobody is going to put conditions on the guardianship rights of a married father, as we almost certainly could not do so under the Constitution.  The family is based on marriage in the Constitution.  I presume that is where the logic is for both married mothers and fathers to have automatic guardianship rights: married fathers could not be discriminated against when compared with married mothers.</p></speech>

I understand the issues of violence, as women constitute the majority of victims.  Women have automatic guardianship rights, no matter what, and it is not as if there would never be an issue.  There were proposals from my party on this.  The ruling is that there is automatic guardianship if a person is on a birth certificate, but it is not as if there are no qualifications.  For example, rape could be used as a qualification, and other issues could be dealt with as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200029#BB02000"><p>This is a complex debate, as I have acknowledged from the beginning.  The issue is definitely evolving, as we can see from the approach I have taken in the Bill to extend automatic rights to unmarried fathers where they have been living with the mother for a time.  There were a number of questions concerning cohabitation.  The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act contains a definition of cohabitation.</p><p>It is normally understood as a committed and intimate relationship.  It will be for the court to determine and have evidence on cohabitation.  Courts are adept at looking for the kind of information that a couple could present in that respect.  That would only come up if the situation was contested between the couple who are living together, because it is automatic if they are living together after 12 months.  If a disagreement arose subsequently and if the father said he had lived there for 12 months, including for three months after the birth of the child, there is a definition of cohabitation in the civil partnership Act, but it is also up to the court to examine that and look for the evidence it would need to prove cohabitation.  That would not be a major issue.</p> <p> I pointed out the various elements in this debate.  We have just heard an argument, and Deputy Boyd Barrett said it too, that there should be exceptions - that it should not necessarily be automatic.  It is automatic for marital fathers, and the mother has the rights by virtue of giving birth.  There is constitutional protection for the married mother and father.  One could not take that away, nor would one want to, although it can happen through a court dispute about access and custody, separation or divorce.  The Bill reflects existing constitutional protections for marital fathers.  We are moving towards giving greater rights to non-marital fathers.  Where a father has ongoing and real involvement, we are making it very easy with the statutory declaration.  The information is given much more readily than it was before.  It is interesting, as Deputies say, that there has not been much discussion of this.  It is surprising, given the importance of the father&rsquo;s role, marital or non-marital, in a child&rsquo;s life.  I am surprised at the number of men who do not realise that by getting a statutory declaration signed they get full guardianship rights.</p></speech>

I have already had discussions with the Department and it will provide that information, just as information is provided stating that a birth must be registered within three months and where that can be done.  All new parents find out about that and register their children.  We will ensure that the information about the statutory declaration is made available, and I have a commitment from the Department of Social Protection that it will become involved in making sure the information is provided.  That is a big change and it arose from the discussion here and the contributions of Deputies Collins and Mac Lochlainn about the need to create far more awareness of the rights of the father and how the father can guarantee them.  Once there is agreement with the mother, the statutory declaration is open.  Many fathers do not fill out that form.  It is a relatively simple declaration to make before a peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths.  We are dealing with the information issues on that.</p>  <p>  The question of maintaining the records was raised.  It is a very interesting one.  We do not have a record of guardians in this country.  This has not just arisen in the context of this Bill.  Guardianship decisions are taken in the courts all the time.  Many fathers go directly to court when there is disagreement with the mother to get their guardianship rights asserted.  The courts refuse between 5% and 10% on the basis that it is not considered to be in the child&rsquo;s best interests, including with regard to the range of issues we have touched on.</p></speech>

That is where the mother disagrees, but the majority of applications are granted.  That is an estimate.  It is hard to get that figure.  For decades courts have made decisions on guardianship, and it is up to the person, just as in the case of a will, to take possession of what we might call the guardianship certificate.  Solicitors may have a copy but there is no repository as such.</p>  <p>  We are being asked to begin to keep an automatic record, a register of guardianship.  In principle that is the right thing to do, but it is quite complex.  The records have to be gathered from every court in the land.  The Courts Service has to work out how that will be done.  A process has to be put in place.  There has to be a decision on the shape of such a register, where it will be held, the combination of national and local records and the information technology systems that record or do not record them.  This is a large piece of work. </p>  <p>  Treoir makes the point that we keep records of many things in this country but there are many contracts that we do not keep records of.  This is a very important aspect of a child's and a family&rsquo;s life.  I am suggesting in amendment No. 60 that I would begin the process of moving towards that by having two pilot projects to work with organisations, such as Treoir and Women&rsquo;s Aid, which have a point of view on this to see how we can put together a policy approach and a recommendation on how to move forward.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Shortall that the role of the registrar is being developed and there will be administrative arrangements and probably regulations from the Department of Social Protection about developing this.  That would be in line with the way information is provided on a variety of rights.  That is a major move under this legislation. </p>  <p>  Several Deputies spoke about the broader context in respect of how a court deals with these issues.  We need family courts to take these decisions.  I will bring forward legislation to establish family courts.  We received advice that establishing family courts would require a constitutional amendment.  I have now decided to move ahead with establishing a family court in each division of the courts, where there would be judges who specialised in this area and more time to hold complex family law cases.  There is also a need to develop mediation services further.  We do not have enough.  There will be a mediation Bill.  Both of these will substantially help the situation. </p>  <p>  Several points were made about cohabitation for 12 months, including for three months after the birth of the child.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and I changed the provision based on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>The approach in the Bill is to require a committed relationship, with a couple living together for three months after the birth of the child.  That is a move towards automatic guardianship for couples in those situations.  Many will be in such a situation and will be able to avail of automatic guardianship as a result.</p> <p> Deputy Tuffy asked about retrospection.  Where a couple has lived together for a number of years, the father is immediately entitled to seek a statutory declaration.  If the couple lives together and there is no objection, as would be the case in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred, the father gets full guardianship rights.  As a result of this Bill, the father in such a position will have automatic rights within a year.</p> <p> Some Deputies asked about automatic rights for all fathers and referred to the different treatment of non-marital fathers in this country.  Some of that arises from the constitutional position but there are issues to be worked on around automatic guardianship.  Those issues include cases where there is no real involvement in the child's life, where the father is not around or where the father fails to exercise his guardianship responsibilities, as Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned.  In such circumstances there are real consequences for the mother and the child.  For example, the mother would have to apply to the court to dispense with the consent of the father for the issue of a passport.  While it is a rare case, it would also apply where a lone parent decided to place a child for adoption.</p> <p> We have spoken about domestic violence and abuse and I agree that we should not make a decision as to the rights of a non-marital father on the basis of the poor behaviour of some other people.  There is further policy work to be done to enable us to deal with the exceptions in legislation.  I have given a commitment to a review of the legislation in two years and, in the meantime, work will go ahead on the various policy issues on which Deputies have commented.</p> <p> A number of Deputies said that other countries have moved to automatic guardianship.  That is true but there exists a variety of meanings for the word "automatic" in this context and it does not always mean one can go from one situation to another.  A range of considerations has been taken into account in the legislation in those countries and we would need to do likewise.  I will do further work on this issue but I believe the provisions in the Bill will substantially change the number of fathers who will automatically be guardians.  They will now know that they can become guardians by signing a statutory declaration and the situation regarding the rights of natural fathers will be much improved.</p> <p> One Deputy stated that parents will now be whoever the State says they will be.  I reject that comment.  Parents continue to be the biological parents except in the very limited and highly specific circumstances of donor-assisted reproduction, which is subject to massive safeguards in the child's best interest.  The golden thread running through this legislation is the child's best interest.  We have to begin to legislate for AHR and DAR, and the way we have approached these issues in the legislation is extremely respectful towards biological parents.  It takes full cognisance of their rights and makes every effort to ensure that the right of the child to genetic information is fully respected.  Some 300,000 people in this country are affected by infertility issues and it was important to deal with parentage issues arising in cases of AHR or DAR.  I reject the characterisation of the Bill as one in which parents are to be whoever the State says they are.  We are building in extra protections for children and families in order that we can have more stable family units where the parents who actually rear the children will have guardianship rights and this will be in the interests of the child.</p></speech>

I thought it had been ruled out of order.  I move amendment No. 49:<blockquote>In page 37, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 12 months following the enactment of this Act on the impact of the changes to guardianship outlined in this section, and in the drafting of the report to consult with groups and organisations concerned with the welfare and safety of children and women.&rdquo;.</blockquote>This amendment ties up some of the issues that arose in the earlier discussion about putting safeguards in place with regard to automatic guardianship.  We want the Minister - say, in 12 months - to examine this and consult with groups and organisations concerned with the welfare and safety of children and women about the very important minority of situations in which women experience domestic violence.  We mentioned earlier that one in five women experience this.  In 2012, 12,000 barring orders were granted.  On one day, for example, 217 women and 152 children were accommodated in refuges.  From 2000 to 2005, garda&iacute; responded to 15 to 30 incidents of domestic violence a day.</p><p>There has been a denial that this is a serious issue for a cohort of women in this country, but it is ludicrous to then say that this is being applied to all men; it is not.  It is a cohort of women and their children, and some safeguards should be attached to automatic guardianship.</p><p>In terms of the other situations that can arise, some Deputies mentioned examples such as that of a young girl who might become pregnant in a situation in which the father, understandably, cannot live with her.  Such fathers should have rights, and I hope that will be the case.  However, most lone parents are not young girls.  They are women with a number of children whose relationships have broken down or whatever.  We all know teenagers or young girls who became pregnant who did not have a meaningful relationship with the father of the child.  We would not agree that that father should necessarily have automatic guardianship.  Are we saying that teenagers who make a mistake in their lives should be stuck with gobdaws for the rest of their lives who will have control over their passports?</p><p>Listening to some Deputies in the House, one would think there are women who are knowingly and deliberately preventing fathers from having constructive, meaningful relationships with their children.  The evidence would suggest otherwise.  I cannot think of any woman who would prevent somebody having a relationship with their child, or guardianship, if he was playing a positive role.  However, 90% of lone parents are women, and two thirds of those lone parents are living in poverty because in many cases they are not getting financial help from the fathers of their children.  The Growing Up in Ireland survey completed in 2013 found that 50% of fathers make no financial contribution to the maintenance of their child.  While I agree that we want fathers to play a positive role with mothers, there are cases in which men are not stepping up to the plate and are not willing to support their children financially, emotionally or in other ways.</p><p>The purpose of my amendment is to include safeguards with respect to guardianship to ensure it is not granted automatically and to provide that organisations such as Women's Aid and other groups who deal with families who are victims of domestic violence will be consulted in 12 months' time to determine whether there has been a negative impact for women and their children arising from the granting of automatic guardianship.  </p><p>It is ironic that Deputies who trooped in here and voted down a Bill to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, which would have allowed women more control over their own fertility, are now lining up to support fathers' rights without giving any recognition to the fact that women are being left in this position.  By the way, I do not agree that women should be left in control of children.  There should be a shared arrangement but, unfortunately, we do not live in that type of society.  It seems that many women are not living with the fathers of their children, presumably for a reason, and these men can and should apply for custody and for shared parentage.  That facility is written into the Bill.  My quibble related to the automatic granting of guardianship, which allows men control over matters such as passports and where the woman lives.  </p><p>A woman who is staying in the women's refuge in Blanchardstown came into my clinic on Monday.  She has a good profession but has not been able to work for two years because of her husband's violence and his sexual violence against the children.  When we discussed this Bill, that woman was horrified to think that because she lived for a period with the father he would automatically have guardianship of those children and she would then have to go to court to prevent him from having that guardianship.  My amendment proposes that safeguards be attached to the granting of guardianship, and I believe everybody should agree with that.</p></speech>

I suppose we are revisiting issues we have already addressed.  The issues Deputy Coppinger raises should be dealt with in other ways and not through the granting of guardianship, because we do not do that for married fathers and mothers or unmarried mothers.</p>  <p>  There is another side to it.  I briefly worked as a solicitor and when I was an apprentice, I worked on some family law.  The system is a real obstacle for some unmarried fathers who would be good parents.  It is an obstacle to go to the court.  It puts a barrier in place that is difficult to overcome.  There is prejudice.  For example, there will be situations where in the case of a young couple with a child, the mother's parents think the father is a waster and the less the young mother has to do with him, the better.  Sometimes, they change their attitude over time.  There is also prejudice.  One gets in all walks of life those who are good, bad or good and bad, but one cannot say a particular category of person is more likely to be bad.</p></speech>

My concern is that this issue was raised, both by Deputy Coppinger and the Minister, in the context of discussing the denial of automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers.  It was wholly unfair to do that.  I am not aware of any figures that suggest that there is a higher rate of domestic violence among non-marital fathers.</p></speech>

It adds to the societal view in this country.  It is a negative message that has been sent out about unmarried fathers.</p>  <p>  We are talking about rights.  It is not only about the rights of mothers or fathers but also the right of children to know both their parents because many studies show that fathers and mothers are important to children.  That is why it is important that we, as a Legislature, uphold the rights of children to know and be cared for to the greatest extent possible by both their parents.  That is why some of us made the point that it is wrong to discriminate against fathers simply because they are not married to the mother of their child.  I still hold that view.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to deal with that issue within the legislation.</p>  <p>  I do not have a difficulty with the proposal that this be revisited in 12 months to allow consultation with organisations concerned with the welfare of children, women and men.  We should look at that in the context of all the rights of mothers, fathers and children and all the responsibilities involved.</p>  <p>  As others stated, there is a problem in this county in that the legislation on social welfare, tax, housing and other social policies sends out a negative message to unmarried fathers and it is important we turn that around.  We must say to fathers, no matter how young and no matter what their circumstances, even where they may not be in a position to provide the care and attention their children need, that it is important they play as full a part as possible in their children's lives because they need them.  It is also important that we expect a great deal of them because by doing that, we are likely to receive a great deal in return.</p>  <p>  We need to change that negative attitude.  We need to talk about the importance of fathers because we know that they have a critical role to play in their children's lives, and fathers should be encouraged to play that role to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200034#GG00700"><p>This is a good amendment because we need to re-examine this section.  The Minister should take it on board.  If we can get this right for the Seanad, the Minister should be open-minded about it.</p>  <p>  There are two conflicting perspectives which need to be reconciled.  First, Deputy Coppinger raises the legitimate concern as to why, in a situation where the parents do not live together and where they no longer have a relationship, the father should get automatic guardianship because there are many circumstances where that could be problematic.  She is correct.  There are many circumstances where it could be problematic and, therefore, it should not be automatic.</p>  <p>  Equally, and this is my problem with the Bill, the Minister's criterion for giving automatic guardianship, where the parents live together for 12 months, including three months after the baby is born, is arbitrary and meaningless.  It is a criterion for which the Minister cannot provide any rational justification.  It is arbitrary and therefore discriminates against unmarried fathers who happen not to live with the mother of the child.  I have a friend who is about to have twins with his partner and they will not be married.  They do not live together and they will not be living together.  To get guardianship, he is going to have to go through an extra hoop over and above somebody who happens to live with their partner.  That makes no sense.  The way to deal with this and to level the playing field is to remove subsection (3) in page 39 and the related paragraph (b).  In this way, for an unmarried father to get guardianship, he would merely have to sign a declaration.  That way one would not have these two different categories.  One would merely have to sign a declaration.  In addition, it should be made as easy as possible for that declaration to be made, unless the mother has an legitimate objection, which she might well have, and there should be a requirement on the State to inform parents about their right to make that declaration.  This arbitrary criterion the Minister has created jars and makes no sense.  I have explained how I think we could resolve this.  The Minister should do that.</p>  <p>  In that context, Deputy Coppinger's requirement that there would be a report on all this later on to see how it is working and whether there are unexpected consequences is a sensible amendment and I support it.</p></speech>

I also believe that both mothers and fathers matter a great deal in a child's upbringing.  I have had a lot of interaction with an organisation called Mothers and Fathers Matter.  I am sure the Minister has met its representatives as well.</p><p>I see nothing wrong with a review, as called for in this amendment.</p><p>It is complex legislation for which little time has been allowed for debate on the issues involved.  In that context, I see no problem with having a review after 12 months and consulting with various groups, including parent support groups, on how the law is bedding in and assessing its impact.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that it should be simple enough to for an unmarried father to make a declaration, particularly if the mother is agreeable.  The process should be simple and should not involve people having to jump through numerous hoops.  It is the children we should be concerned about, fundamentally.  I know lots of single fathers with children who are doing an exceptional job of raising them.  A review would be not be any harm and for that reason I support the amendment.</p></speech>

Having listened to the most recent contributions of Deputies Shortall, Boyd Barrett and Mattie McGrath, I would suggest that it boils down to the reality of situations.  If we try to create a framework for fairness and responsibility, having recognised the truth and reality of the situation, then we are on the road to respect for the individuals involved.  Anybody who comes into existence is an individual.  That may sound trite or too obvious but sometimes one has to express the obvious.  Everybody who comes into existence has the relationship potential of father, mother, daughter or son.  These are the four possibilities and they are extraordinarily valuable and unique to each individual.  Respect is what is needed for those relationships.</p>  <p>  If one starts timing and stop-watching obsessively to give the appearance of legislative safeguard, one can create a prison rather than a liberation for those individuals.  Therefore, I would be inclined to agree with the observations made by Deputies Shortall, Boyd-Barrett, Coppinger and Mattie McGrath but let us not get neurotically tied up with an algebraic approach because it does not work.  There is no stop watch or calendar to measure reality; they are convenient reference points for the truth of existence.  Therefore, whatever we can do to assure respect for the arrival of children into this world, as sons or daughters to fathers and mothers, should be done.  The relationships may, at any given point, be not so good or good; they will change.  People have mood swings within a day.  It is important not to snooker future human beings, whether they are mothers, fathers, sons or daughters and to give every prospect of respect by what we do.  These are some context thoughts to bear in mind before the ink dries on the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-03-12a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015031200035#HH00300"><p>This is a particularly important part of the legislation which I also made reference to during the Second Stage debate.  All Deputies in this House will have had different experiences of how the law applies and will know of instances where flaws in the law became apparent later.  This is an extremely complicated area.  I am not a legal professional but would like to be one in the future, given the scope for such professionals afforded by this legislation.  The theory and practicality can be argued <i>ad infinitum</i>, as they will be.  They will be appealed to the higher courts and not always with the result that either the child or the parent might anticipate or want.</p><p>The concept of the rights and entitlements of parents must be set against their responsibilities and those responsibilities should be borne in mind at all times.  I would be inclined to favour the view of the mother and to weigh my thinking, on balance, in her favour unless there are very serious issues presenting, such as an addiction, for example, which might impact on her ability to be a good mother.  As we all know, when cases go to court there is generally an argument as to whether either parent is a fit parent and generally discussion revolves around the basis upon which such a conclusion is reached.  In some cases, situations can be constructed so as to make it appear that one parent is not a good parent and to be fair, the length of time that the courts have to deal with cases is not always sufficient to come to a sound judgment on that, although those involved will try to do the best they can.  We have all come across cases which seem clear cut on the face of it and about which a conclusion is reached.  However, if one were to investigate those cases more deeply, one would find variations and nuances that were not obvious at first sight and which would have impacted quite significantly on any judgment or evaluation made.  </p><p>Reference has already been made to guardianship and the wider implications for same.  We have all had countless experiences of situations where guardians, particularly in respect of social welfare legislation, have to go to the ends of the earth to prove that the other party is no longer willing to, or capable of, honouring their responsibilities.  As a result, some guardians may find themselves without adequate resources to sustain themselves and the child who is the subject of the guardianship.  I would hope that this will be borne in mind in the future and that we do not see pitfalls emerging which could mean that the welfare of the child, which is supposed to be paramount in all of these discussions, is at risk because of a lack of resources on the part of his or her guardian.  </p><p>We have all dealt with situations which are relevant here.  If a parent is absent without contact for a number of years, then regardless of previous living arrangements, it is very difficult to sustain an argument that he or she is seriously concerned about the welfare and well being of the child involved.  We have all come across situations in which one parent decides to absent himself or herself from the family home and disappear into thin air, as it were.</p><p>They could then leave that partner, come back to the first partner after ten or 15 years and say ,"hello, I'm back", with them deemed to be the returning prodigal son and that all is well.  If a reconciliation can be reached, I am all in favour of it but I would not like to see the rights and entitlements of the parent who took responsibility during those years, went through all the hardship it involved, stood up to their responsibilities and reared that child or children on their own ignored in that kind of situation.  I would not like to see their situation weighed against them in a court.  </p> <p> My last point relates to who determines what the child wants.  The legislation proposes that an expert such as a child psychologist would carry out this work.  We all claim to be experts in our own right, some of us to a greater extent than others in this particular business.  I fail to see how, in the space of an hour or two or even less, an expert can look into the eyes of a child aged five, four or three and work out what they think the child requires and what he or she favours.  I do not accept it at all.  It is unfair to the expert as well to ask him or her to come to the conclusion he or she has been asked to come to, namely, to tell the court what he or she believes the child wants because the child has hinted at this.  We should remember that even a very young child may feel intimidated by one or either party and may wish not to offend one parent or the other.  There are many nuances here that the Minister is aware of because of her own knowledge of the subject.  It is particularly important that we as legislators take cognisance of those very complicated issues that will emerge because like Murphy's law, if it can happen, it will happen.</p></speech>

In respect of appropriate family courts, mediation and contact centres, we have had some very good pilot projects lately relating to contact centres where parents who have separated but who are in dispute about the children can be helped to work through the many issues.  This is preferable to these disputes being in court.  It is something I would like to develop.  The legislation will be useful in terms of determining those very complex issues because Deputy Durkan is right about the role of experts.  That is just one input.  In the legislation, we have defined the best interests of the child for the first time and provided ten or 11 criteria by which that decision will be made.  This will be a very useful framework for the court to consider when making decisions on custody, access and guardianship.  It will involve all those involved in ongoing relationships with the child and will examine the capacity of the parents to continue to be involved and a range of issues.</p>  <p>  I have already spoken about how domestic violence can be taken into account.  It will not just about one person trying to determine the views of the child.  It will be about that complex set of criteria being used to determine what should happen to the child.  I believe that where there are disputes relating to guardianship, custody and access, much more could be done, as is done in other countries, to make sure families agree these decisions outside the court setting through mediation and contact centres.  If it is in court, the development of family courts would be the way to go so that these issues would have the kind of time they deserve and decisions would be taken by people who have a special interest or expertise in the area.</p>  <p>  Many of the contributions are about becoming a guardian after one year.  The thinking behind this was to show a sustained relationship and a familial relationship in terms of living with the child but it was not considered to be too high a threshold in terms of the amount of time.  We are not saying it should it be three, four or five years.  We are talking about a period of one year so it is not a very high threshold.  I take the point made by some Deputies.  Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted a friend.  In that situation, clearly the statutory declaration is available immediately to that father.  The Deputy also argued that there are exceptional cases.  If he was quoting a different type of situation, he might be saying that there are certain factors in this case that I would be concerned about where this might be considered an exceptional case and where there would not be automatic guardianship.  I am making the point that there is work to be done on this and that I am committed to linking with the various groups who would make inputs into this.  I am very happy to engage in a consultation in the very near future to begin further work on this.  I have committed to a two-year review.</p>  <p>  In respect of the point made by Deputy Coppinger about a year, it is a very short period because there is work to be done, for example, in terms of developing the regulations that will apply for the registrar in charge of the more readily available statutory declaration.  That will take some time.  It is a very short period to do the review.  I do not think we will have enough information for me to agree to the amendment.  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment but I will commit to carrying out a consultation in the very near future with all of the relevant groups the Deputy referred to.  I repeat the commitment I made on Committee Stage that the Department and I will review the operation of the new guardianship provisions within two years of their coming into operation.  I also have the pilot project relating to the development of the register of guardianship.  We need a pilot project to tease out all the issues around that.  I am advised that it is a very substantial piece of work.  Given the number of guardianship arrangements in courts and the range we will have under this legislation, I need the pilot projects to see how that might be developed and to scope out the scale of the work that needs to be done.</p></speech>

I accept what the Minister has said as it will take a while to set up and if the Minister is giving a commitment that there will be a review within two years.  Hopefully, that will carry on to the next Government regardless of whether the Minister is in office.  There are significant changes in the Bill.  It would have been better if there had been a lot more discussion outside the House because of the complexity of family situations.  For some reason, this has not happened on television and in the rest of the media.</p>  <p>  I wish to clarify that I had a fantastic father and that I am all for fathers but I also recognise that it is not an ideal world, that there are situations where women and children need protection from fathers and that guardianship gives someone a lot of power over a family even if he is not living with the family.  If we are extending guardianship, we need some kind of review of it.  I also welcome the statutory declaration, which should be promoted.</p>  <p>  Some Deputies have given the impression that fathers are beating down the door to get access to their children.  We need scientific analysis of this because there is quite a vociferous fathers' rights lobby out there.  Most of us know situations where men are not treated equally in the courts but for every one case, we know ten others where women have been left supporting children economically and socially.  I favour a complete change in the way parenting happens.  It should be shared.  It is not right that it falls on women, which is one of the reasons there are very few women in this Chamber.  There are fewer women here than there are in the parliament in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the type of society we have puts the responsibility for child rearing on women.  This needs to change but until it does, we also need to recognise that there are men who do not take responsibility not just in terms of domestic violence, but in supporting their children over the years.</p></speech>
