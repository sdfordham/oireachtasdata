I would ask for the co-operation of all Members.  I call Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800003#A00200"><p>Since yesterday, the controversy surrounding the O'Higgins report involving the leaked transcripts has escalated, particularly given the leaks of a different nature, one to &quot;Six One&quot; news, a separate leak of transcripts to the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme and extensive leaks in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>again this morning.  These are all fairly damaging in terms of their revelations, albeit perhaps crying out for a broader context.</p><p>The bottom line is the transcripts are now there for all to see.  We cannot live in some sort of make believe world where they are not there because they are not officially there.  The reality is they are in the public domain and they make for stark reading.  It is stated that the instructions were at all times to challenge the motivation and credibility of Sergeant McCabe in regard to the corruption and malpractice allegations.  The judge questions this, asking whether it was:</p><blockquote>...because he was motivated by malice or some such motive and that impinges on his integrity.  If those are your instructions from the commissioner, so be it.</blockquote><p>To which the senior counsel replies:</p><blockquote>So be it.  That is the position, Judge ... I mean this isn't something that I am pulling out of the sky, Judge, and I mean I can only act on instructions.</blockquote><p>The key point I made to the T&aacute;naiste yesterday was that this needs to be comprehensively and transparently addressed; it cannot be left as it is.  I accept it is entirely unsatisfactory we are where we are now but we are where we are.  It may be uncomfortable for people but there are some stark realities emanating from this.  As I said yesterday, it goes to the core of how whistleblowers and people who have made assertions and allegations in good faith are treated.  The Guerin report was very strong on this aspect of the case in quoting all the previous people who were in charge of Bailieborough station for over a decade, and all speak very highly around the integrity and credibility of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Adams asked the same question.  Can she confirm whether she actually had a meeting with the Garda Commissioner in regard to this entire issue, with a view to bringing about a mechanism to resolve it in a transparent manner?  Has she had such a meeting or will she indicate to the House that she intends to have such a meeting?</p>  <p>  Up to now it has been said that a section of the Act precluded by law any discussion on legal instructions and legal submissions.  That appeared to change yesterday in so far as the T&aacute;naiste identified it, not so much as a question of law, but as a question of legal privilege and the waiving of same.  That clarity needs to be made absolute.  It is my view that if it is an issue of the waiving of legal privilege, that is an issue or mechanism that may allow for some way to resolve this fully and wholly.  I did it myself as a Minister in one case where allegations were flying around in regard to the haemophiliac tribunal.  Much to the chagrin of many people, I waived legal privilege on that occasion to show there was no conspiracy on behalf of anybody to do anything.</p></speech>

It seems to have led to the rather hostile and adversarial manner in which the senior counsel representing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner approached the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800003#A00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The first thing I would like to do is put on the record of this House what the commission said about Sergeant McCabe.  It stated:</p><blockquote>Some people, wrongly and unfairly, cast aspersions on Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s motives; others were ambivalent about them.  Sergeant McCabe acted out of genuine and legitimate concerns, and the commission unreservedly accepts his bona fides.  Sergeant McCabe has shown courage, and performed a genuine public service at considerable personal cost.  For this he is due the gratitude, not only of the general public, but also of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While some of his complaints have not been upheld by this commission, Sergeant McCabe is a man of integrity, whom the public can trust in the exercise of his duties.  Assistant Commissioner Byrne told the commission that, &ldquo;Sergeant McCabe is regarded as a highly efficient sergeant, competent&rdquo;.  This assessment is shared by the commission.</blockquote><p>It is important for us to recall that in the context of the discussion here today.  I want to remind the House of what the Garda Commissioner said when she was speaking about Sergeant McCabe and the commission.  She said she accepted fully what was said in the commission investigation about him.  That is the first point I want to make.  We should be clear that the Commissioner absolutely accepts the findings of the investigation in regard to that, and is acting on the findings and the recommendations.</p><p>I did meet with the Garda Commissioner the day before yesterday.  I was discussing a number of issues with her in regard to the inner city and gangland issues and the recommendations in the O'Higgins report.  I understood at that point she had not yet issued the statement but she made some of the points that were subsequently in her statement in regard to her accepting the report and accepting Sergeant McCabe's bona fides, and that she never suggested malice was the motivation.  I will obviously have ongoing discussions with her.  I have no doubt she will seek to clarify as much as possible the points raised by Deputy Martin in her own interventions.</p><p>There are a number of places where those interventions will be made.  I want to remind the House in the first instance that we now have in place, with the will of this House, an independent Policing Authority with an oversight role in regard to policing.  I have forwarded the report to the Policing Authority and it has indicated publicly that it will be addressing and discussing the O'Higgins report with the Garda Commissioner.  I think that is a very appropriate forum.  One of the points that was made again and again in this House was that we should have a body with an oversight role.  We will have a discussion in the House next week and the justice committee has also indicated it will take this forward.</p><p>Deputy Martin raised questions in several other areas, including the question of discipline in regard to the Mullingar incident.</p><p>This was one point I discussed with the Commissioner when I met her and, of course, whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would look at the commission's report with a view to seeing whether there were implications for discipline.  The Commissioner informed me that the Garda would be looking at it from this perspective and with this lens and that it would be followed through by it.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question on the particular incident.</p> <p> The other point the Deputy made was on evidence and waiving a legal right.  I am advised by the Attorney General that in making a distinction between briefing a legal team and the evidence it can be quite difficult to separate the two and that common sense would dictate that this is the case.  Clearly, if the Commissioner saw fit to make a further comment and she was in a legal position to do so, it would be helpful in answering some of the points made by the Deputy.  I have no doubt that within the legal constraints she will say as much as possible when she is questioned in the future on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800004#B00200"><p>There is enormous controversy about this issue, regardless of whether we or the Minister like it.  I put it to her that there must be some significant intervention to deal with it comprehensively and transparently.  Is it her intention to meet the chairperson of the Policing Authority to put it to the authority that it is important, in terms of accountability and transforming culture, that people with important points, allegations and assertions to make to improve performance ultimately will be protected?  This is extraordinary when we read the transcripts as they are presented.  I acknowledge that we may not be getting the full picture, but nonetheless they make fairly stark reading in terms of the attitude demonstrated.  There was a suggestion yesterday that this was inquisitorial, but it is clear from the transcripts that in the initial phase it was adversarial in that there was almost an all-out, right through, attack on the credibility and motivation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the person making the allegation.  It is important to note that we have moved from a position where the legal instructions and legal submissions were absolutely not to be discussed to one where now it is a matter of waiving legal privilege, which is a separate issue as regards being part of the Act.  It should not have taken this long to have the matter cleared up and clarified.  Will the Minister seek a meeting with the chairperson of the Policing Authority to have a comprehensive discussion with a view to working out a mechanism to deal comprehensively with this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800004#B00300"><p>To answer the Deputy's question, we did authorise, develop and establish this new mechanism for accountability with the Policing Authority.  It is an independent body, a point made by many Members of the House when we went through the legislation on it.  It would not be right for me to try to prescribe the work of the authority, but I take the point made by the Deputy.  I have already said I will refer the report to it.  I have no difficulty with having a meeting.  I am due to have a meeting with its chairperson and no doubt the fact that the report is being referred to her will form part of the discussion.  I stress that the authority is an independent body.  The Deputy recognises this.  It gets on with its work, but it has indicated that it will discuss the report.  I believe it is the right forum in which to do so.  Having established an independent body we should allow it to get on with its work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is quoting and commenting extensively on what are, in fact, illegal transcripts.  I take the point that they are in the public domain, but we still do not know their context in terms of where they came in the commission evidence, what preceded them and what followed them.  In many ways, the publication of such illegal transcripts robs the Garda Commissioner of an opportunity to defend her good name and we must make the point that 94 other witnesses also gave evidence.  Yesterday I made the point that protecting the integrity of the commission process was very important because in the future we want people to have confidence in commissions of investigation, the fact that they brief their legal teams and that their issues will be dealt with in a confidential way.  The commission held its hearings in private and guaranteed confidentiality, but it now looks like we are rerunning part of the investigation.  We are losing sight of the very broad questions in the commission of investigation which need analysis and follow-up.  We must ensure they are acted on and that criminal investigations which will take place in the future will be of the standard the commission has stated they will need to be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800004#B00400"><p>As we all know, the responsibility of the Opposition is to hold the Government to account.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has a responsibility to hold the Garda Commissioner to account and is answerable to the D&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in wanted the Policing Authority to have more powers.  It should be able to hold the Commissioner to account and no one Minister should have this responsibility.  If the Minister checks the record, she will see that the Government blocked this; therefore, holding the Commissioner to account is her responsibility and she must be able to account to the D&aacute;il.  A series of allegations have been made about how Sergeant Maurice McCabe was treated after he had raised concerns about investigations of serious crimes in the Cavan and Monaghan division.  In particular, it has emerged that two senior officers, apparently, claimed that Sergeant McCabe had admitted to them he was motivated by malice.  This allegation was also, apparently, made by a senior counsel acting for the Commissioner.  I will put to the Minister the exact same questions I put to her yesterday.  Answers to these questions are the very minimum the D&aacute;il, citizens of the State, serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in particular, victims of these serious crimes deserve.  There is no legal barrier to the Minister answering them.  In fact, she is obliged to do so.  It is very straightforward.  Yesterday, she met the Commissioner in the north inner city, where last night Iattended the community vigil.  Did she speak to the Commissioner about these issues?  Has she asked what instructions she gave to her legal team about Sergeant McCabe?  Has she asked whether two officers claimed that he had admitted to them that he had acted with malice?  We are entitled to answers to these questions.  Whatever the Minister might want to say about the detail and the context, we, as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, are obliged to hold her to account.  She is obliged to answer these very straightforward questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800004#B00500"><p>I have already made it very clear that we will have a number of opportunities to have further and detailed discussions on the commission of investigation.  There is the independent Policing Authority.  I reject the Deputy's assertion about the powers of that body.  It has an oversight role in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which I have no doubt it will fulfil very well.  It has already held one public meeting and will have others.  It can make an independent decision on how it should handle the report.  There is much talk about the politicisation of policing.  We have an independent body which can discuss this issue.  It has the authority and we should allow it to get on with its work.  We will also have a further detailed debate in the House on the commission's report.</p>  <p>   Yesterday I outlined the legal position in commenting on particular transcripts.  I have had a conversation with the Garda Commissioner about the recommendations made in the report.  I have had a discussion about how they need to be implemented.  She has informed me about the attitude and the wish of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal effectively and properly with Garda whistleblowers and that it is implementing in full the legislation on protected disclosures.  As I stated, with regard to the details of the transcripts, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to respond on partial transcripts, but it is important for me to have a conversation with the Commissioner and ongoing discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the implementation of the report and the many issues addressed in it which need to be deal with.</p><p>I make the point that the report concerns the period 2007 to 2008.  These complaints were first brought to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2009, who at that point appropriately referred them back to the then Commissioner.  Many of the issues that are dealt with in that report have now begun to be implemented already by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-----</p></speech>

We argued for it to be established along the lines of the Patten Commission.  It was only when the series of scandals erupted that she eventually and reluctantly opted for the model she now has.  I wish the commission well but I return to my original questions.  How do we sort this out?  How does a member of the Opposition get this Government to answer an entirely valid question?  I did not ask the T&aacute;naiste to deal with the transcripts.  I did not ask her to deal with the detail of this.  I simply asked her, as the line Minister, that she ask the Garda Commissioner to tell her what instructions she gave to her legal team about Sergeant McCabe and whether two officers had claimed that he admitted to them that he acted with malice.  That is very straightforward.  There is no legal barrier whatsoever to the Commissioner answering these questions.</p>  <p>  This Government - at least the last Government - made this mistake many times, namely, a marked refusal to treat the D&aacute;il with the respect that it deserves, and on numerous occasions information was withheld.

Let me remind Deputy Adams and this House that the reason we have a commission of investigation is that a range of allegations, statements, etc., were made about a range of issues because of what I would call the pioneering work that Sergeant McCabe did.  Let us also remind ourselves, however, that a commission of investigation has interviewed all 94 of those witnesses, operated under statute, brought in witnesses, cross-examined them and brought in legal teams.  Some of the allegations that were made two years ago have been found to be not correct-----</p></speech>

They are within the privilege of that relationship and that discussion.  That is clearly understood.  It is a basic tenet of justice.</p>  <p>  I stated also that it is imprudent and a dangerous precedent for such discussions to be thrown into the public domain as it will affect the reputations of persons - I already made the point about reputation - as they have no comeback and the person who made allegations in giving instructions would have no comeback either.  We have to reflect carefully on what is being asked here.  The ability of persons to engage with a commission of investigation could be seriously compromised.  One should think about what is being asked.  What we are asking of the Commissioner in regard to this commission of investigation is that the private briefings that one has with lawyers or solicitors should be put into the public domain.</p>  <p>  It is illegal for me, for example, to have access to those transcripts.  I do not have access to them - neither does Deputy Martin or Deputy Burton.  Deputy Burton does not know the context of them.  That is important.</p></speech>

The strategy the Deputy suggests runs the risk of circumventing the Commissions of Investigation Act  2004.  As I have said, I have no knowledge of the transcripts, whether they are selective or not, and whether they present a true, fair and reasonable account of what happened at the commission of investigation proceedings.</p>  <p>  I would repeat that what is certainly the case is they are not reflected in the final report and what Deputies are asking me to do is to second guess the commission of investigation.</p></speech>

We all are clear that we want an efficient, professional modernised police force that can apprehend criminals who are doing a great deal of damage in this State.  Part of this investigation was about serious matters that happened regarding crimes committed and which were part of the subject of the investigation.</p>  <p>  I repeat what I want to know now.  It is a simple request.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's plan to give the House information which, as has been stated earlier, whether one likes it or not, is now in the public domain relating to the questions asked and put, apparently, as far as we know, according to accurate records, by the lawyers?</p>  <p>  Let me stress that no one here has suggested that any of the limitations put on witnesses by section 11 about information being published is in any way being questioned.  We are talking about the legal strategies and about the fact that the suggestion and the claims have been made that a legal strategy was being undertaken which would seek to undermine matters regarding credibility and even integrity.</p></speech>

Deputy Burton is incorrect to say that full information is in the public domain.  It is not in the public domain.  There is some information, based on illegal action.  The Deputy is asking me to comment on what has been an illegal act that has produced these partial transcripts.  The only person who has the full knowledge of all that was presented in terms of evidence at the commission of investigation is Mr. Justice O'Higgins.</p>  <p>  I intend to take the report of the commission with its many recommendations.  I intend to ensure the continuation of all of the measures in the programme of reform which the previous Government started.  These include the new policing authority, the protected disclosures, the strengthening of GSOC and the increased resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it can deal more effectively with the issues raised in the report.  In addition there is the ICT investment of &euro;200 million and the improvements to the PULSE system, and any other points made in the report which will lead to the kind of policing service that Deputy Burton says citizens want to see.  I agree with Deputy Burton that it should be the key goal of all of us in this House to have a policing service we can be proud of.  Clearly, there are deficiencies identified in the report.  It is sad and disheartening to see how victims were dealt with.  We have a new victims directive.  We have legislation coming forward.  That is where the focus needs to be.</p>  <p>  With regard to the questions about the current controversy about transcripts, of course I will put the maximum information that I can access on the floor of this House and when we have the discussion here next week.</p></speech>

I would point out to the T&aacute;naiste that on Thursday last an e-mail was sent to the Whips requesting nominations for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that they were to be submitted by the close of business on Friday last.  Parties were invited to send in their nominations.  It was said that this had to be done so that a motion would be put to the House tomorrow, 19 May.  On Monday, we learned that the Government Whips contacted the Office of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to advise that the motion would not now come before the House on 19 May, even though three nominations were submitted before the deadline on Friday last.</p><p>Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify what has occasioned the change of mind?  There was a big rush on Thursday to get the names in before Friday.  That happened.  Some parties submitted names.  Then on Monday, unbeknownst to anybody, there was a communication to the Ceann Comhairle's office to the effect that the vote would not be taken this week.  It is surprising.I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste gave some rationale as to why it is the Government's intention not to hold the vote tomorrow.</p></speech>

Deputy Billy Kelleher tabled those questions.  It is striking that there have been more than 5,500 cancellations of operations in the first six months of the year.  It is illustrative of the runaway train waiting lists in public and voluntary hospitals have become during the past two years.  It points to the urgency required on the part of the Government to establish and ring-fence substantial funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce waiting lists and times for operations and avoid cancellations.  Although the former Minister was setting his face against the initiative, it is very important that an urgent intervention be made to stop the runaway train that is waiting lists and times.  It is part of the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  There was also a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the funding for home care packages and home helps every year.  Although it was included in the last programme for Government, we all know that they were cut.  We must be careful about what a programme for Government states, given that they can be fictional at times.  There is concern among constituents that a cap has been put on the number of home helps.  Will the T&aacute;naiste bring clarity to the issue for me?  Is she aware if there is a cap on home help hours or home care packages?  Will she ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to come back to us on the issue?  It flies in the face of a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the funding for home care packages and home helps.</p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act provides that public bodies such as Departments, local authorities and certain other publicly funded bodies are obliged to establish and maintain procedures for the making of protected disclosures by workers who are or were employed by them and for dealing with such disclosures.  Public bodies must provide their employees with written information on these procedures.  They must also publish an annual report setting out the numbers of protected disclosures made to them and the action taken.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline whether her Department or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their annual reports and, if not, when she expects to receive them?</p></speech>

In the programme for Government there is a very strong commitment to making a sustained effort to improve waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those who have been waiting the longest.  The Deputy mentioned the National Treatment Purchase Fund, in which he has a particular interest.  There is a commitment to deliver &euro;50 million in 2017 to address waiting lists.  The Department is also engaging with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE in planning a dedicated waiting list initiative which will be rolled out this year.  It will be of some benefit to those who have been waiting the longest and will be targeted.  Over 60% of patients on waiting lists wait less than six months for their required care, while 94% wait less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months.</p></speech>

Having improved waiting times for scheduled or planned care for patients is a priority.  Action was taken by the former Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to deal with the matter.  Among the initiatives taken by him were the provisiln of an extra &euro;51 million in 2015 to reduce maximum waiting times.  It was an important initiative.  The end of 2015 result showed a 95% improvement in inpatient and day case waiting lists and an improvement of 93% in outpatient waiting lists.  The extra money invested has helped to improve and reduce waiting times and it is important that we recognise this progress.  We are committed to dealing with the issue and, as resources become available, they will be invested to reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about home care packages.  Although there was a cap for a period, funding was increased in recent years as resources allowed and the economy recovered.  We all recognise the major importance of developing investment and being able to provide for further investment in home care packages.  I hope the decision the HSE took yesterday to reduce the cost of prescription medicines will release some resources that can be invested in services such as home care packages.</p></speech>

I have questions on the health information and patient safety Bill, the replacement for the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grants and the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The health information and patient safety Bill was part of what the previous Government claimed to be the cornerstone of a new health system.  The delayed HSE report for February revealed that 2,700 patients aged over 75 years had spent longer than 24 hours on trolleys.  Yesterday there were 321 patients on trolleys, with the number in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in my constituency among the highest.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, reported that in March 9,381 patients were on trolleys, an increase on the figure for last year and double the figure for March 2008.  The health information and patient safety Bill has faced significant delays.</p><p>When will it be published?</p> <p> On the issue of the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grants, in February 2013, the Government scrapped them and since then I have been on my feet constantly asking when the alternative will be put forward.  We must remember these were scrapped on the back of a recommendation from the Ombudsman for the scope of these schemes to be widened but rather than widen them, the Government got rid of them.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health at the time, Kathleen Lynch, acknowledged it was because it would cost too much.  Almost four years later, the new programme for Government is again promising new legislation for a new mobility scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  It failed to do it during the previous term, so when will this legislation be published?</p> <p> The immigration and residency reform Bill is also promised in the programme for Government.  It commits to implementing the recommendations of the McMahon report on direct provision.  That was in the draft programme but it was removed from the actual programme.  That is a very serious decision.  The McMahon report made 173 recommendations.  Mr. Justice McMahon described the refusal to allow asylum seekers the right to access the labour market as absolutely heartbreaking and immoral.  He also urged an amnesty for those who have been in this country for more than five years.  I visited the direct provision centre in Mosney several times.  Some children have spent their entire lives in what is a slightly tarted up version of Long Kesh, and whatever about the benevolent attitude of the management and so on, it is not right or fair that families should be detained there for so long.  Will the T&aacute;naiste consider a once-off amnesty?  Will she reinstate the commitment to the McMahon report in the programme for Government, and when will she publish the immigration and residency reform Bill?</p></speech>

I made the point yesterday that given that the Government is only in place for a short period, there will be discussions between each Department and each Minister with the Taoiseach in the coming week to discuss the priority legislation and that will then be shared and discussed in the House.  The priorities from each of the Departments and the legislation we hope to get through in this D&aacute;il term will be published.  I am informed the legislation raised by the Deputy is being drafted at present.</p>  <p>  On the mobility scheme, work is being done in the Department of Health on a new scheme and that will also require legislation.  I can confirm there is no change in the Government policy in implementing the recommendations of the McMahon report.  Many of the recommendations have already been implemented.  There has been an acceleration in the pace of decision-making with respect to those who have been in direct provision for more than five years.  The numbers have gone down substantially.  A decision was taken by the previous Government to increase the money made available for children and for access to third level education.  Those were some of the serious recommendations in the report.  Work is ongoing on implementing the recommendations and I intend to soon again meet members of the working party to review progress.  I held a number of meetings with them during the course of last year to discuss the implementation of the recommendations.  The change the Deputy described between the draft programme and the programme is not significant.  We remain committed to what we said at the time regarding the implementation of those recommendations.  </p>  <p>  On the residency Bill, the Deputy will recall that the protection legislation was passed by this House last year.  It was decided to separate it from the larger immigration and residency Bill.  Given of the scale of that Bill, it had not been implemented by successive Ministers down the years and we decided it was important to bring forward the protection legislation.  That was brought separately to this House and passed but work is ongoing on the broader Bill.</p></speech>

We have a new Department which is called the Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  The  commitments in the programme for Government to the arts are very vague and it has very few costings.  Will the Government provide for a debate on the important role of arts and culture both at home and abroad and on what the programme for Government means in terms of funding for the arts in Ireland?  It is our calling card when we go abroad and it is tremendously important for us at home as well.  When the appointments of Ministers of State are announced, which I believe will happen by the weekend, will there be a dedicated Minister of State for the arts to underlie the significance and importance of the sector?</p>  <p>  My second question about the programme for Government is a simple one.  Who is the Minister for the environment?  I note from reading the programme for Government that we have a Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and a Department of Communications and Climate Change but we no longer seem to have a Minister who deals with the environment.  That particular job seems to have gone AWOL from the programme for Government.</p></speech>

Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us who is the Minister for the environment?  Could the word "environment" be reinstated in the title of the Department?  Would that require legislation?  It is absolutely important that we are clear on this.  It is very good to have a Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government but we actually need a Minister for the environment.</p></speech>

I agree entirely with what she has to say about the contribution of the arts to our economy and to our international reputation.  The reconfiguration of the Department of the arts and the wider responsibility in regard to rural affairs does not represent in any way a downgrading of the arts, and I want to be very clear about that.  The programme for Government contains a number of commitments to the arts, including a specific commitment to progressively increase funding for the arts, including for the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy grows.  As the Deputy is well aware, the outgoing Government was very committed to the arts and made a number of very significant capital investments in the arts, including an investment of &euro;30 million at the National Gallery, an &euro;8 million expansion project at the National Archives and a &euro;10 million renovation project, which has been long awaited, will get under way at the National Library.  It should be noted that the investment in the National Gallery was given at a time when the public finances were still in a very fragile state.</p><p>Funding for the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board and the national cultural institutions has been increased over the last two years.  It is worth noting that the investment in the arts has continued and increased as the economy has improved.  A great deal of work has been done on drafting the first ever national cultural policy, Culture 2025, which the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, hopes to publish shortly.  It will be a boost to the arts community in that there will be a very well laid out arts strategy following a great deal of consultation.  Importantly, there will also be a new investment programme for regional arts centres which will amount to &euro;18 million over the next six years.  That will make a significant contribution to the provision of arts in the community at local and regional level.</p> <p> On the Deputy's question on Ministers of State, that is a decision for the Taoiseach which I understand will be made later this week.  I have no doubt the priority the Government gives to the arts will be reflected in those appointments.</p> <p> On the Deputy's question on the environment, the areas of climate change, air quality, the EPA and waste management are now the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughton, while the other areas of housing, planning and so on remain with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney.</p></speech>

Three reservoirs have already been closed down.  While Northern Ireland Water and the company claim there is no danger to the water, they have had to close three reservoirs.  They started the test drilling without planning, without environmental assessment and without any consultation.  While it is a different jurisdiction, this has very significant consequences for down here.  It opens the door to and sets a precedent for test drilling which is part of the process of commencing actual hydraulic fracking.  It involves drilling into the ground using chemicals in a way that can damage the water table.  Friends of the Earth and our own public representative recently elected in Belfast have been up campaigning about this.  There is great concern about it.  It has serious implications.</p>  <p>  My question to the T&aacute;naiste is on the moratorium, which is in essence an informal arrangement, and any intention of the Government.  There is nothing to stop oil companies test drilling in this way and, if one likes, commencing the process of hydraulic fracking.  Given the commitment of the Government and Members on all sides of the House to deal with the imminent possibility of runaway climate change, there is no place whatsoever anywhere on this island for hydraulic fracking.  That message must be sent out and enshrined in legislation.  I brought before the House just before the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il a Bill which was written by Friends of the Earth and An Taisce looking for a complete ban and prohibition on hydraulic fracking.  The issue of fracking is not mentioned at all in the legislative programme.  Is there any intention on the part of the Government to move towards a decision to ban fracking?  When will we see the EPA report on fracking, which I believe has already been discredited on foot of the way it was conducted, and discuss it here?  Most importantly, are we going to have legislation or is the Government willing to take the Bill I introduced in the last D&aacute;il on board to allow us to discuss legislation here?  If we are serious about tackling climate change, I hope there will be agreement around the House on the urgent necessity on foot of what is happening in the North to send out a clear signal that hydraulic fracking is not acceptable.</p></speech>

Certainly, our position on fracking was made clear by the last Government and that remains the case.  I understand there are no plans for legislation right now.  The Minister has not yet received the EPA report the Deputy mentioned and there are many environmental considerations which will have to be discussed.  There are no plans to change the current situation on licenses for fracking.</p></speech>

A deadline was set regarding the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  As such, how does the Government Chief Whip justify extending it?  We must be very clear about this.  The Ceann Comhairle was elected in a different way and we all welcomed that the Members of the House had a say individually in that regard.  Now, we have a situation where a deadline of last Friday was set with regard to the submission of nominations for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  How can the Government Chief Whip justify extending that?  What is the purpose?  I have a clear question.  Is it to allow further nominations to be submitted?  Did the Government submit a nomination?  Is it to facilitate Fine Gael that the time is being extended because it missed the deadline and wants to submit a nominee?  That is totally wrong.  This is not a good way to start politics.  We all came into this in good faith and this is gerrymandering of the worst type.  If a farmer in Kerry is late putting in an application for something, a deadline cannot be extended.  The Government's answer when it misses the boat is to extend the deadline and push it out to facilitate itself.  If I see the Government putting in a nominee, that will be a dirty start to its work.  If it is going to do that, it is disgraceful and the people of Ireland will look very badly upon it.  I take this very seriously.  What the Government is doing is wrong.  The other leaders who spoke today were not strong enough with the Government on this issue because what it is doing is a disgrace and people will not like the Government for it.</p></speech>

Tar &eacute;is d&uacute;inn 70 l&aacute; a chaitheamh ag fanacht ar Rialtas, is l&eacute;ir go gcaithfimid fanacht le haghaidh ocht seachtaine eile chun sonra&iacute; na h&aacute;bhair agus na dualgais a bheidh i gceist sa Roinn nua a fh&aacute;il amach.  Tuigim freisin nach mbeidh foireann ioml&aacute;n na Roinne curtha i bhfeidhm ar feadh ocht seachtaine eile, rud a chialla&iacute;onn nach mbeidh an Roinn seo ioml&aacute;n eagraithe roimh bhriseadh na D&aacute;la le haghaidh an tsamhraidh.  Mar sin, n&iacute; bheidh an Roinn in ann feidhmi&uacute; i gceart go dt&iacute; m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair seo chugainn, n&iacute; bheidh coiste na Roinne in ann feidhmi&uacute; i gceart go dt&iacute; m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair seo chugainn agus n&iacute; bheimid, mar Theachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, in ann ceisteanna parlaiminte a chur chuig an Roinn go dt&iacute; m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair seo chugainn.  T&aacute; aon rud a bhaineann le forbairt r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach, le gn&oacute;tha&iacute; tuaithe, leis na heala&iacute;ona agus leis an nGaeltacht curtha ar ceal le haghaidh ocht seachtaine, ar a laghad, gan tr&aacute;cht ar an mbriseadh le haghaidh an tsamhraidh.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin nach mbeimid in ann oibri&uacute; leis an Roinn seo go dt&iacute; s&eacute; mh&iacute; tar &eacute;is an olltoghch&aacute;n.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin dochreidte.</p>  <p>  Is masla &eacute; don Ghaeilge nach bhfuil an tAire, an Teachta Heather Humphreys, i l&aacute;thair.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint l&eacute;i inn&eacute; faoin d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; ag tn&uacute;th lena feice&aacute;il anseo.  Nuair a ainmn&iacute;odh an Teachta McHugh mar Aire St&aacute;it sa Rialtas deireanach, d&uacute;irt an tAire, an Teachta Heather Humphreys, go raibh s&iacute; chun an Ghaeilge a fhoglaim ach, de r&eacute;ir dealramh, n&iacute;l an teanga foghlamtha aici f&oacute;s.  Taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; sin an m&eacute;id t&aacute;bhacht a thugann an tAire agus an Rialtas don Ghaeilge.  Seolann s&eacute; teachtaireacht ollmh&oacute;r do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  M&aacute; breathna&iacute;mid ar an ainm at&aacute; ar an Roinn anois - an Roinn Forbartha R&eacute;igi&uacute;na&iacute;, Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Tuaithe, Eala&iacute;on agus Gaeltachta - is l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht curtha ag deireadh an liosta.</p></speech>

N&iacute;l mo chuid Gaeilge r&oacute;-mhaith, ach t&aacute;im ag cleachtadh.  I mBunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann aithn&iacute;tear an Ghaeilge m&aacute;r &aacute;r dteanga phr&iacute;omha sa St&aacute;t.  Samhla&iacute;tear d&uacute;inn go bhfuil dualgas m&oacute;r ar ghach Rialtas acmhainn&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il agus tionscnaimh a chur in &aacute;it chun an teanga a chosaint agus &iacute; a fhorbairt go hioml&aacute;n.</p><p>The Labour Party recognises the central place of the Irish language in our heritage, our history and as a rich resource for daily life.  The Constitution explicitly recognises Irish as the first language of the State and it is our view that this places certain responsibilities on all governments to vigorously support the protection and development of the language.</p><p>I want to take a slightly different tack today.  I speak through the medium of English.  I feel strongly that Irish is often presented in a binary fashion, typified by those who have the language and those who do not.  The last census recorded more than 160 languages being spoken in this country and we have a multiplicity of nationalities here now.  I believe that in the globalised society we live in, we must recognise the attempts by those who are seeking to encourage bilingualism and multilingualism within this island.  It is not about one language being better than another but about using languages efficiently.  It is also about seeking to encourage greater awareness of the critical importance of language learning, not only in terms of increasing employment possibilities and meeting industry needs, but also its broader value in the spheres of education, the arts and in the context of supporting social cohesion and intercultural understanding.  </p><p>In that context, Irish has a significant role to play in terms of encouraging multilingualism and bilingualism.  A group called One Voice for Languages focuses on the importance of all languages, including Irish, being valued in a real sense and beyond the tokenism that often inculcates debate in this House and elsewhere.  This group focuses on three basic statements. </p><blockquote>Mar a chreidimid: T&aacute; teangacha luachmhar, riachtanach agus spreag&uacute;il.  What we believe: Languages are essential, valuable and exciting.<br /><br />A bhfuil uainn: Ceisteanna teanga a ard&uacute; ag an leibh&eacute;al is airde rialtais agus a chur ar a sh&uacute;ile do phobal uile na t&iacute;re.  What we want: Language issues to be raised at the highest levels of government and to be brought to the consciousness of the country as a whole.<br /><br />Mar a dh&eacute;anfaimid: Gn&iacute;omh&uacute; mar ghl&oacute;r cumhachtach agus mar shl&oacute;gadh d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d go l&eacute;ir ar sp&eacute;is leo ceisteanna teanga.  What we will do: Act as a rallying point and a powerful voice for all interested in language issues.</blockquote><p> Globalisation has changed our experience of language diversity.  There are now few places in the world in which multiple languages are not present and in which people do not make use of repertoires that draw on several different languages.  As a former Minister with responsibility for research and innovation, I have found there is ample research evidence regarding the numerous benefits of language learning.  For example, in the Irish context research has demonstrated that bilingualism in Irish and English enhances mathematics performance and that the Irish language lends itself to the better understanding of mathematical concepts.  There have been repeated statements from high-level industry leaders, employment specialists, advisory bodies and experienced linguists on the deficit in appropriate language skills and the important role the learning of other languages, of which Irish is one, can play in the improvement of literacy levels.  An appreciation needs to be fostered, at Government level and among the wider public, on the significant cognitive, social, developmental, cultural and linguistic enhancement that can be attained through the learning of Irish or other additional languages.  We need to improve the teaching and learning of science, mathematics and engineering and research shows that where students are educated through the medium of Irish, and where they live in bilingual communities, their learning outcomes are a lot better.  We should focus more on those opportunities.  I speak for thousands of people throughout this country when I say I do not know if I will ever be fluent but I would love to be able to conduct my everyday business in a bilingual way.  Perhaps we need to focus more on the opportunities therein.</p> <p> I am glad to say I live in an area where, over the past five years, there has been an explosion in the number of places in Gaelscoileanna and there are two Gaelscoileanna under construction in my constituency, in Mainistir Fhear Ma&iacute; and Mainistir na Corann.  We are very proud of that and we want to ensure that there is a continuum between what students learn at primary level and what they learn at post-primary level.  We need to do more to encourage people in communities like Mallow, Fermoy and Midleton, where we have these Gaelscoileanna, to use the language in their everyday transactions on the street or through interactions with Government agencies.</p> <p> We need to widen the debate and recognise that there are over 160 languages spoken in this country.  We need to ensure we target resources in a way that ensures that more people speak the language or, at least, are inculcated with the language during everyday usage, and this is a big challenge.   We are all wedded to the 20-year strategy and if we witness economic growth we need to ensure the resources are made available so that the plan bears fruit.  </p> <p> Every time there is a debate on the Irish language somebody gets up and says somebody has such an amount of proficiency and somebody else does not.  Let us get away from that binary, hackneyed debate and broaden it out so that we can get more people actually speaking Irish.  Let us encourage people to speak the language more and if we broaden the debate we can also encourage the use of bilingualism in everyday life.  That is a very reasonable proposition.</p></speech>

Ach n&iacute; amh&aacute;in go bhfuil na foirmeacha t&aacute;bhachtach, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach gur f&eacute;idir an dh&aacute; teanga a chur tr&iacute;d an t&iacute;r.</p>  <p>  Bilingualism is good for us.  It is good for one's brain, one's children and the community.  As the previous speaker stated, we need to do everything we can to encourage bilingualism.  Deir roinnt daoine nach f&eacute;idir le roinnt p&aacute;ist&iacute; bocht d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an nGaeilge chomh maith leis na fadhbanna eile at&aacute; acu.  Is masla m&oacute;r &eacute; seo do na daoine seo.  Perhaps that explains why, for example, in my community in Ballyfermot, we do not have a Gaelscoil or any facilities for education in the Irish language.  There is a big demand for Irish language education in Ballyfermot, but people have to go to Inchicore, Clondalkin or as far away as Lucan to access Irish language services.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a r&aacute; go mbeidh an ch&eacute;ad na&iacute;onra - sin cr&egrave;che le Gaeilge - ag oscailt an bhliain seo chugainn agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin down to the local community and Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath. </p>  <p>  T&aacute; timpeall 2 milli&uacute;n duine sa t&iacute;r seo at&aacute; cuid Ghaeilge acu, agus sin uimhir l&aacute;idir.  Caithfimid commitment a dh&eacute;anamh le linn an Rialtais seo maidir leis an nGaeilge.  Is f&eacute;idir linn tos&uacute; anois sa Teach seo le gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; agus gr&uacute;pa ag tabhairt spokesperson don teanga.  This would encourage everyone to use Irish more frequently.</p><p>Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn br&uacute; a chur maidir leis an teanga sa Teach seo.  Caithfimid Aire a fh&aacute;il, coiste don teanga a chur <i>in situ</i>, agus infheist&iacute;ocht de timpeall &euro;18 milli&uacute;n ar a laghad a bheith againn chomh maith le Minister oideachais ag pl&eacute; leis an nGaeilge sna scoileanna.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-t&aacute;bhachtach.  </p></speech>

The cuts made to pay off the banking debts have hit Irish language programmes and job creation initiatives in Gaeltacht communities.  The regressive changes to public sector employment and job numbers has impacted on the provision of public services and on the ability of the public sector to provide services through Irish.  We have seen a massive rise in emigration from Ireland through the austerity years with young people moving abroad to seek employment.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that the net emigration figure from 2008 to 2014 is 141,000, 81,000 of whom are those under 24 years of age.  Rural areas have been particularly hit hard by youth migration as young people move to towns and cities for employment and education opportunities and Gaeltacht communities like similar communities have been hit hard by these measures.  This has been the case for decades.</p><p>Given the impact that this has not only on rural communities but on the Irish language, one would have thought that the Government would intervene to provide some employment and a future for young people but, unfortunately, the opposite is the case.  Instead, young people have been hit with cuts to jobseekers' allowance payments and pushed into so-called labour activation schemes, such as JobBridge, Gateway and so on.  In Gaeltacht communities, organisations in receipt of State funding such as Foras na Gaeilge and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have been hit with severe cuts.  </p><p>Budget cuts show that the establishment parties are hypocritical on the issue of the Irish language.  They speak of the respect they have for it.  They speak about how vital it is for the culture of the country.  There is no shortage of that talk but at the same time, the same politicians make savage cuts to the budget of Irish language organisations and projects relating to the language.  Foras na Gaeilge funds Irish language organisations and projects throughout the country.  It has seen its budget cut from more than &euro;20 million in 2017 to just over &euro;15 million in 2015.  When inflation is taken into account that is a 39% cut since 2001.  This means there is a <i>de facto</i>embargo on new and existing projects.The capital budget of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been cut from &euro;22 million in 2007 to an incredible &euro;6 million in 2013, a 73% cut in the budget when employment is falling in Gaeltacht communities while at the same time the budgets for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland were increased in that period.</p><p>Why is it that the Fine Gael-Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Governments implemented this policy of cutting funds for the development of employment in Gaeltacht communities when expanding the funding outside the Gaeltacht?  It is no wonder that those communities have formed the view that they are being consciously neglected by the establishment parties.</p><p>Conradh na Gaeilge with the support of 77 organisations has published a very important document, Investment in the Irish Language and in the Gaeltacht from 2016 onwards, which outlines well researched proposals for increases in funding.  It is seeking an additional &euro;18 million in funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge which would result in an estimated 1,175 new jobs, &euro;5 million less than the 2008 funding.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance fully supports that demand.  Not only should the budget cuts be reversed in their entirety but we should fight to expand the funding greatly.  Conradh na Gaeilge outlines that even a partial reversal of the cuts could mean an expansion in Irish language community schemes where language plans in the Gaeltacht could be implemented, local groups all over the State can work on expanding the use and knowledge of the language where Irish speaking families would get the support they need in using the language and where Gaeltacht schools would get language assistance.</p><p>There have been tremendous protests on the right to use the Irish language.  The Dearg le Fearg protest in 2014, in which I participated, had 10,000 people on the streets in Dublin.  The cuts in the public sector in recent years have dramatically reduced the number of civil and public servants and impacted on the talent pool of our public sector workers.  Many of those now retiring or taking early retirement are the staff who have the language skills to deal with the public through Irish.  Answers we received from Ministers show that on average 4.5% of staff have sufficient Irish to deal with people.  Some Departments have very low figures, such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with 0.8%, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with 0.5%.  Many people who wish to engage with the State, through Irish, have the continual problem of being able to get forms in Irish or speak to people in the language they want to speak in, even when they call the designated Irish language telephone line.  Irish speakers say they face a constant battle to conduct simple interactions with the State, such as getting a passport form.  There is widespread support for the availability of public services through Irish for those who want them as illustrated in a number of public opinion polls.  </p><p>The programme for Government generally outlines that it supports extra funding for the language.  However, there are no commitments in the programme for Government about what level of funding will be advanced.  There is a need for an active campaign by Gaeltacht communities and Irish language speakers to secure the funding they need and to secure their language rights.  Capitalism is a system which ravages linguistic diversity all over the planet.  The rule of profit is what comes first and the language rights of minorities come second.  To secure rights we must fight for them and take on the wider agenda of cutting public services, cutting employment and cutting services to communities, such as our Gaeltacht communities and Irish speaking community.</p></speech>

However, I cannot speak Irish and can just about follow a conversation in it.  I have a few words of Irish, but that is the extent of it.  However, I have a commitment to the Irish language which, as I have said previously in the House, I show by the fact that my children attended an all-Irish school in the days when the Gaelscoileanna movement was almost frontier territory.  There was very unsatisfactory accommodation available and the movement was in the early stages of development.  I have a commitment and a desire to see the language revived and people like me need to be catered for.  There are actually a lot of people who would put themselves in that category.</p>  <p>  One item is absent from this Chamber and I do not know if anyone has it in front of him or her.  Most of those who have spoken spoke in Irish.  There is a translator in the booth translating, yet none of us has earphones.  That is a very obvious shortcoming.  Increasingly, we hear people speak in Irish, which is fine as long as those who do not speak the language have the means to understand what they are saying, certainly if it is a long speech.</p>  <p>  I turn to the revival of the language.  I have seen at first hand the phenomenal revival of the language within my constituency which is outside a Gaeltacht area.  There are six or seven primary schools, as well as a second level school in Lucan which was developed on a regional basis for north Kildare.  It has been so successful that it is oversubscribed, with the result that now there is nowhere for students in north Kildare to go.  They are being asked to go somewhere which is less satisfactory.  Total immersion is very different from the likes of a sruth or an aonad, which does not seem to be understood.  It appears that one has to re-establish a demand in an area for an Irish school, even though there has been such a demand since the 1980s.  The school in Lucan would not have been developed if there been no demand in north Kildare and west Dublin.  There are 6th class pupils from six or seven feeder schools in north Kildare and areas such as Edenderry and Dunboyne.  When my children went to Gaelscoil U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh in Leixlip, we fought every inch of the way to have the school established.  The accommodation was what other people had finished with.  Essentially, there was no big demand for revival and it had to be fought for.  </p>  <p>  I am seeing the exact same thing happen in the provision of Gaelscoileanna at second level.  There is a need for co-ordination between the Departments involved.  To be honest, I am not at all happy that we have this miscellaneous Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  With a lot of portfolios, it lacks focus.  The Irish language is within a context which is our culture.  The aspects of arts and heritage are being dumbed down.</p><p>I am not at all surprised there is a big resistance to that, as we speak.  The Irish language exists within that culture and that culture needs to be nurtured.  It is very interesting that the Taoiseach was at an event yesterday in America, where there is a greater appreciation of our culture, by the look of it, than we ourselves might have.  I believe that needs to be revisited as a matter of urgency.</p> <p> The Gaeltacht needs special attention.  These are very special areas and it is not just a question of the language on its own.  We must consider the needs of people living in those areas in a complete way, because this goes from language to commerce to culture and to every particular element of life.  However, any big revival is going to come from outside the Gaeltacht areas.  There needs to be a degree of co-ordination so there is not a resistance, where there is a proven demand, to giving expression to that demand, for example, through the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p> There is a very exercised community in my constituency, one I am very happy to lend support because I believe it is being very badly treated in terms of the development of and commitment to a second level school, given the school in west Dublin is over-subscribed.  The reality is that some of these primary schools have existed since the 1980s and 1990s; they are established schools, with some being two-stream schools and one a three-stream school.  They are incredibly well appreciated and it is understood there is an educational value in bilingualism, in that it is possible for people to become multilingual much more easily if they are bilingual in the first place.  People often ask about the economic advantage of learning Irish whereas we do not dismiss the economic advantage of learning many other languages.  If Irish is a benefit to our learning of other languages, given the prospect of multilingualism, we have to see it in those terms.</p> <p> There can sometimes be a bit of elitism among people who almost believe that if others do not speak Irish, they are not the real thing.  We have to cut that out.  If there is to be a revival we have to provide opportunities for people to speak Irish, even if it is in less than perfect patterns.  This includes providing opportunities outside the classroom environment because while people might learn Irish in the classroom, if they do not have the opportunity to speak it outside that environment, they will lose the language.  We have to look in a more nuanced way at how we provide for this.</p> <p> There needs to be a strong connection with the Department of Education and Skills in terms of co-ordinating the development of the language.  If this stops at second level, we are hardly going to achieve what we all want to see achieved.</p> <p> There are other issues in regard to the whole area of the culture within which the language exists.  For example, many of us watched the excellent programme that RTE broadcast at the time of the commemorations, which was greatly appreciated.  At the same time, the playlists of Irish music contain less and less of what people really appreciated when they saw it in a programme because these things are always developed on the basis of commercial value.  I believe we need to look at this in its totality because if people appreciate the context, they will appreciate the language.

Go bun&uacute;sach, t&aacute; todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta i mbaol.  Cad is Gaeltacht ann?  An &aacute;it fisici&uacute;il n&oacute; meon aigne &iacute;?  N&oacute; an bhfuil an d&aacute; rud fite fuaite lena ch&eacute;ile?  Caithfear an cheist a chur ar gach Teachta D&aacute;la: cad &eacute; a bhfuil ar bun agat i do Dh&aacute;ilcheantar f&eacute;in chun c&aacute;s na teanga a choth&uacute;?  Braitheann pobal na Gaeilge orainn uilig ceannaireacht a l&eacute;iri&uacute; i dtaobh cearta agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; teanga a chur chun cinn.  Mo n&aacute;ire sinn mar Theachta&iacute; D&aacute;la m&aacute; thr&eacute;igimid aisling na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>  Is seoid n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta luachmhar chult&uacute;rtha &iacute; an Ghaeltacht agus t&aacute; dualgas orainn uilig &iacute; a chosaint do na gl&uacute;inte a thiocfaidh in&aacute;r ndiaidh.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn cuimhni&uacute; gurb &eacute; an difr&iacute;ocht idir Gaeilge phobail na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht n&aacute; gur slabhra neamhbhriste len&aacute;r sinsir Ceilteacha &iacute; teanga phobail na Gaeltachta.  S&iacute;neann fr&eacute;amhacha na teanga siar i bhfad roimh r&eacute; na Normannach, roimh ionsa&iacute; na Lochlannach, roimh r&eacute; na Cr&iacute;osta&iacute;ochta agus fi&uacute; siar go dt&iacute; r&eacute; na miotaseola&iacute;ochta.  Ach dealra&iacute;tear go bhfuil meath le brath sa Ghaeltacht de dheasca easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge, easpa taca&iacute;ochta an St&aacute;it agus bagairt an Bh&eacute;arla chuile &aacute;it.  Is ceist phr&aacute;inneach &iacute; an meath seo.  Is &eacute; seo am an gh&aacute;tair do chainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais.</p>  <p>  De r&eacute;ir figi&uacute;ir&iacute; dhaon&aacute;ireamh 2011, c&eacute; go ndeireann 41.4% go bhfuil siad ina gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge, n&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;ideann ach 1.8% de dhaoine an Ghaeilge ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il.  Is &eacute; sin 77,185 duine.  Faraor, n&iacute;l ach duine as tri&uacute;r d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  Is maith is eol d&uacute;inn go bhfuil athr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide mar bhagairt ar an timpeallacht agus go bhfuil an timpeallacht i mbaol.  Mar an gc&eacute;anna, dearbha&iacute;onn an Comhaontas Glas go bhfuil todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta i mbaol.  T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; le haghaidh plean &eacute;igeand&aacute;la tarrth&aacute;la gan a thuilleadh moille.</p>  <p>  Obair in aisce a bheidh sa Str&aacute;it&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge gan infheist&iacute;ocht chuimsitheach i seirbhis&iacute; taca&iacute;ochta do theaghlaigh agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; don &oacute;ige.  Caithfear t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt do na ceantair Gaeltachta ina bhfuil an l&aacute;mh in uachtar ag an teanga mar theanga an phobail.  Is riachtanas &eacute; &oacute; thaobh saibhreas na teanga can&uacute;int&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha traidisi&uacute;nta na Gaeltachta a chaomhn&uacute; don todhcha&iacute;, maraon leis an gcaighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il.  Is riachtanas &eacute; ard-chaighde&aacute;n Gaeilge a bheith ag &aacute;bhar oid&iacute; agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; &oacute; thaobh sealbh&uacute; teanga.  Ach, i roinnt ceantair faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; saibhreas na Gaeilge &aacute; chailli&uacute;int mar thoradh ar thionchar an Bh&eacute;arla agus easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; taca&iacute;ochta Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  Is &uacute;dar imn&iacute; &eacute; nach bhfuil Roinn Rialtais freagrach as tith&iacute;ocht sa Ghaeltacht, rud a chinnteoidh cosaint na teanga.  Caithfear dul i ngleic le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tith&iacute;ochta agus tac&uacute; leis na teaghlaigh at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh a seacht nd&iacute;cheall &aacute;r dteanga agus &aacute;r n-oidhreacht a chaomhn&uacute; agus a choth&uacute;.  T&aacute; frustrachas ar phobal na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; dualgas orainne, mar pholaiteoir&iacute; i nD&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, cluas &eacute;isteachta a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeltachta iad fein agus d&aacute; gcuid &eacute;ilimh ar mhaithe le st&aacute;das na Gaeilge a neart&uacute;.</p>  <p>  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas a chinnti&uacute; go mbun&oacute;far an l&aacute;r-ionad n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta don oideachas i mBaile Bhuirne at&aacute; geallta le fada an l&aacute;.

Is f&eacute;idir linn foghlaim &oacute; thaith&iacute; mhuintir na Breataine Bige agus muintir na hAlban agus bonn reacht&uacute;il a bheith againn maidir le cur i bhfeidhim strait&eacute;is n&aacute;isiunta, Gaeltachta agus &aacute;iti&uacute;la.</p><p>M&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiula, caithfear cearta Gaeilge a neart&uacute; seachas iad a mhaol&uacute; agus a laghd&uacute;.  Molann an Comhaontas Glas go mbun&oacute;far aonad na Gaeilge i Roinn an Taoisigh chun a chinnti&uacute; go gcuirfear an tAcht seo i bhfeidhm i ngach eagra&iacute;ocht St&aacute;it agus i ngach Roinn.<br/><br/>In ainneoin meath na Gaeltachta, is cos&uacute;il go bhfuil f&aacute;s agus forbairt ag teacht ar l&iacute;on na nGaelscoileanna &oacute; cheann ceann na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; 305 bunscoil ar an oile&aacute;n seo againne: 126 sa Ghaeltacht, 144 lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus 35 sna S&eacute; Chontae.  Ag eascairt as an dearcadh dearfach seo, caithfear g&eacute;arch&eacute;im na Gaeltachta a phl&eacute; agus r&eacute;iteach a fh&aacute;il ar na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in.  Is f&uacute;inne at&aacute; s&eacute; mar pholaiteoir&iacute; taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don chainteoir &oacute;g d&uacute;chais nach bhfuil sa mh&oacute;ramh a thuilleadh agus sealbh&uacute; na teanga a chinnti&uacute;.

Maidir leis na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide, t&aacute; &eacute;acht d&eacute;anta ag Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, RTE agus ag TG4 le 20 bliain anuas, maraon le craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach feasta.  T&aacute; ardmholadh tuillte ag na craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; uilig as na s&aacute;rchl&aacute;racha a rinneadh don chom&oacute;radh 1916.  Molaim TG4 as an duais IFTA a bhronnadh ar an gcl&aacute;r &quot;An Klondike&quot;.  Mar ph&aacute;irt&iacute; uile-oile&aacute;nda, molaimid BBC Tuaisceart &Eacute;ireann feasta agus t&aacute;thar ag s&uacute;il le breis cl&aacute;racha Gaeilge uathu amach anseo.

Nuair a bh&iacute; an arts festival ar si&uacute;l i nDroichead &Aacute;tha le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, chonaic m&eacute; go raibh slua tuismitheoir&iacute; agus p&aacute;ist&iacute; ag feitheamh.

N&iacute;l a fhios agam an t-ainm ceart at&aacute; air - Manch&aacute;n, b'fh&eacute;idir.  He is a well-known Irish speaker ar an teilif&iacute;s.

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag tabhairt focail do na p&aacute;ist&iacute;.

Nuair a d'fh&aacute;g na daoine sin an &aacute;it, bh&iacute; spiorad na hathbheochana ina measc.  T&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine i mo dh&uacute;thaigh f&eacute;in ag labhairt Gaeilge, ag l&eacute;amh Gaeilge agus ag &eacute;isteacht leis an nGaeilge.  I mo thuairim, t&aacute; seans againn sa Pharlaimint seo n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar son na Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  Molaim go m&oacute;r an jab iontach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag na Gaelscoileanna.

T&aacute; ruda&iacute; ag athr&uacute;.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge ag f&aacute;s, ach go h&aacute;irithe.</p>  <p>  Molaim an obair ata d&eacute;anta ag TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.

Nuair a l&eacute;imid na leabhair staire a bhaineann le 1916 - t&aacute; P&aacute;draig Mac Piarais luaite cheana f&eacute;in sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo - is l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn go raibh an-mheas ag gach &eacute;inne a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach in imeachta&iacute; na bliana sin ar an spiorad n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus an spiorad Gaelach.

Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar sin.</p>  <p>  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; freisin ar Chonradh na Gaeilge, gr&uacute;pa a rinne an-jab ar fad sna blianta sin.  T&aacute; ceist agam do Chonradh na Gaeilge agus do gach &eacute;inne eile at&aacute; p&aacute;irteach i ngluaiseacht na Gaeilge.  N&iacute;lim ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil spiorad acu - is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil - ach is d&oacute;igh liom gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeid&iacute;s n&iacute;os m&oacute; os comhair na ngn&aacute;thdhaoine.  D&aacute; mbeadh feachtais ar si&uacute;l acu, bheadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ag faire ar na feachtais sin agus ag bualadh leis na rannph&aacute;irtithe.  What I am saying really is that the Irish language movement has done a fantastic job.  I would like to see more bolscaireacht and more "in your face" action.  The biggest protest we had here for a long time related to an Ghaeilge &eacute;igeantach.  Tharla s&eacute; nuair a bh&iacute; an Taoiseach, an Teachta Enda Kenny, mar Cheannaire an Fhreas&uacute;ra.  Bh&iacute; na c&eacute;adta scol&aacute;ire ag si&uacute;l trasna an bh&oacute;thair gach seachtain.  Bh&iacute; na daoine &oacute;ga seo ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  N&iacute; fheicim anois iad ar chor ar bith.  Caithfimid s&iacute;ceola&iacute;ocht n&iacute;os fearr a bheith againn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or go gcaithfidh feachtas br&iacute;omhar a bheith ann.  T&aacute; easpa gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochas ann, i mo thuairim.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint ar sin ar&iacute;s.</p>  <p>  Is eol dom go maith gur cheart d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar cheist mhaith na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh inniu mar nach bhfuil ach c&uacute;ig shoicind f&aacute;gtha agam.  B&iacute;odh misneach againn.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;, agus beidh an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt ag daoine &oacute;ga.  Molaim Aire na Gaeltachta freisin.</p></speech>

D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire, an Teachta Humphreys, a bhfuil na c&uacute;raim&iacute; seo uirthi.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach fada go dt&iacute; go mbeidh Aire St&aacute;it aici a bheidh ag pl&eacute; leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeltacht amh&aacute;in.  D&uacute;irt muidne sa manifesto a bh&iacute; againn go mbeadh Aire sinsearach ag pl&eacute; leis an nGaeltacht d&aacute; mbeimid sa Rialtas.  N&iacute;or tharla s&eacute; sin.  M&aacute; chuirtear Aire s&oacute;isearach i mbun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta, molfaidh m&eacute; go m&oacute;r a leith&eacute;id de cheapach&aacute;n.  Ba cheart go mbeadh cead ag an Aire St&aacute;it sin freastal ar chruinnithe Rialtais, go h&aacute;irithe nuair at&aacute; rud ar bith a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht n&oacute; leis an nGaeilge &aacute; mheas.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an Aire s&oacute;isearach a bh&iacute; sa Rialtas deireanach, an Teachta McHugh.  Rinne s&eacute; s&aacute;r-iarracht ag an am sin an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Molaim gur cheart don Aire a bhfuil na c&uacute;raim&iacute; sinsearacha uirthi an rud c&eacute;anna a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh "delegated powers" ag an Aire s&oacute;isearach at&aacute; le ainmni&uacute; ag deireadh na seachtaine n&oacute; ag t&uacute;s na seachtaine seo chugainn.</p>  <p>  Caithfidh m&eacute; an Rialtas a ch&aacute;ineadh &oacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge sa chl&aacute;r Rialtais at&aacute; foilsithe acu.  T&aacute; alt amh&aacute;in sa chl&aacute;r f&aacute; dtaobh den Ghaeilge.  Labhra&iacute;onn s&eacute; go ginear&aacute;lta faoin Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeimid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na spriocanna at&aacute; ag an Rialtas agus an Aire agus a bheidh ag an Aire St&aacute;it.  D&eacute;anann cl&aacute;r an Rialtais tagairt don strait&eacute;is 20 bliain agus an f&oacute;cas a bheidh ar jabanna.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur f&eacute;idir jabanna a chruth&uacute; gan i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid a shol&aacute;thar d'&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  M&aacute; t&aacute; &aacute;iteanna Gaeltachta ag dul i gcoimhlint le &aacute;iteanna eile ar fud na t&iacute;re, caithfear t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, ba cheart deontais n&iacute;os m&oacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il chun comhlachta&iacute; &Eacute;ireannacha - comhlachta&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la, n&oacute; "indigenous" - agus comhlachta&iacute; a thagann &oacute; th&iacute;ortha thar lear a mhealladh go dt&iacute; na Gaeltachta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, bh&eacute;inn claonta i bhf&aacute;bhar mo chontae f&eacute;in agus Gaeltacht Dh&uacute;n na nGall.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist freisin i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais n&iacute;os m&oacute; b&eacute;ime a chur ar na&iacute;onra&iacute; agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimhe sin.  Deirtear freisin go nd&eacute;anfar infheist&iacute;ocht n&iacute;os m&oacute; sa teanga.  Caithfidh m&eacute; an Rialtas a ch&aacute;ineadh &oacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil ach l&iacute;ne amh&aacute;in sa chl&aacute;r a bhaineann le infheist&iacute;ocht sa r&eacute;imse seo.</p>  <p>  Glacaimid go l&eacute;ir leis gur seoid luachmhar as cuimse &iacute; &aacute;r dteanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go raibh an Roinn n&aacute; an Rialtas a bh&iacute; ann roimhe seo d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin Ghaeltacht.  Bh&iacute; c&uacute;raim&iacute; na Gaeltachta orm idir 1989 agus 1994.  Ag an am sin, bh&iacute; muidne ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar na deontais f&aacute; choinne na b&oacute;ithre &aacute;ise.  N&iacute;l pingin rua ar f&aacute;il anois f&aacute; choinne na b&oacute;ithre &aacute;ise.  N&iacute;l airgead m&oacute;r i gceist.  Ba cheart go dtabharfar ar ais ar&iacute;s na deontais do na b&oacute;thre &aacute;ise, cos&uacute;il leis na sc&eacute;imeanna LIS a bh&iacute; ann roimhe seo.  Rinneadh an-obair maidir leis na b&oacute;ithre strait&eacute;iseacha sna Gaeltachta&iacute; nuair a bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute;l pingin rua ar f&aacute;il anois f&aacute; choinne athnuachan baile.  Caithfear airgead a chur ar f&aacute;il ar&iacute;s f&aacute; choinne athnuachan baile.  Is fi&uacute; amharc ar na c&eacute;anna freisin.  Ta m&eacute; ag smaoineamh ar Ch&eacute; an Rannaigh ar Oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r agus go leor c&eacute;anna eile i nGaeltacht Dh&uacute;n na nGall.  De r&eacute;ir na f&iacute;ric&iacute;, ta &euro;600,000 ar f&aacute;il do na c&eacute;anna achan uile bhliain.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an oiread sin airgid &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam ceist a chur s&iacute;os faoin mh&eacute;id airgid a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il anuraidh.  An cuireadh &euro;600,000 ar f&aacute;il, n&oacute; a leath de sin ar f&aacute;il?</p><p>B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an t-airgead sin ag dul &aacute;it &eacute;igin eile.</p> <p> Thar na blianta, bh&iacute; caighde&aacute;n na tithe sa Ghaeltacht ar chomhch&eacute;im le tithe ar bith eile sa t&iacute;r.  Cuid&iacute;odh go m&oacute;r leis sin na deontais a bh&iacute; Roinn na Gaeltachta ag cur ar f&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l na deontais sin ar f&aacute;il anois agus ba cheart go nd&eacute;anfar athbhreithni&uacute; ar sin agus deontais a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine at&aacute; sa Ghaeltacht, do dhaoine at&aacute; ag labhairt Gaeilge agus do dhaoine at&aacute; ag iarraidh ar a bp&aacute;ist&iacute; an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Nuair a bh&iacute; na deontais sin ar f&aacute;il, bh&iacute; orthu na t&eacute;arma&iacute; sin a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  N&iacute; miste liomsa faoi na t&eacute;arma&iacute; sin, ach caithfear an t-airgead a chur ar f&aacute;il do na daoine sin.</p> <p> C&eacute; go bhfuil sol&aacute;thar airgid ar f&aacute;il f&aacute; choinne &aacute;iseanna pobail, n&iacute;l go leor ansin.  N&iacute;l ann ach sol&aacute;thar airgid iontach beag.  Caithfear n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid a chur ar f&aacute;il thar na blianta at&aacute; romhainn.  T&aacute; an-&eacute;ileamh air agus, m&aacute; amharcann muid ar na hionaid phobail tr&iacute; na Gaeltachta&iacute;, t&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuair na coist&iacute; sin airgead &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Ach n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; sin, chuaigh na daoine sin amach ag baili&uacute; airgid agus ag cur go leor airgid isteach sna hionaid phobail sin.  Nuair a chuir an tAire Airgeadais t&uacute;s leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, labhair s&eacute; faoi na mn&aacute; t&iacute; agus a dt&aacute;bhacht.  &Oacute; mo thaobh de, ceapaim f&eacute;in go bhfuil na mn&aacute; t&iacute; mar ph&aacute;irt l&aacute;rnach do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh.  Caithfidh muid d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go gcuirfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid ar f&aacute;il do na mn&aacute; t&iacute; a bhfuil ag d&eacute;anamh an oiread sin chun an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn. </p> <p> Caithfimid smaoineamh gurb &eacute; an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios againn chomh maith nach bhfuil deireadh leis an Ghaeltacht n&aacute; leis an Ghaeilge taobh istigh de theorainn na Gaeltachta.  Caithfear ardmholadh a thabahairt do na comhlachta&iacute; ar n&oacute;s Conradh na Gaeilge at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh an oiread sin chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, ba cheart a lua anseo na spriocanna at&aacute; ag Conradh na Gaeilge.  Ina measc, ceann amh&aacute;in acu san n&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh i bpobal na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; pobal Gaeilge sa chathair seo, i mB&eacute;al Feirste agus i go leor &aacute;iteanna eile sa t&iacute;r.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ag caint Gaeilge anseo i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath n&aacute; mar at&aacute; i go leor de na Gaeltachta&iacute; beaga.  Bh&iacute; Conradh na Gaeilge ag iarraidh go gceapfar Aire sinsearach.  N&iacute;or tharla s&eacute; sin.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, ba cheart go mbeidh delegated responsibilities ag an Aire s&oacute;isearach.  De r&eacute;ir na r&aacute;fla&iacute; at&aacute; ag dul thart, deirtear liom go mbeidh comhchoiste ag pl&eacute; leis an Ghaeilge agus leis an Ghaeltacht agus &eacute; sin amh&aacute;in.  Is d&oacute;cha go mbeidh a fhios againn am&aacute;rach n&oacute; an bhliain seo chugainn.  M&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin, chuirfinn-se f&aacute;ilte roimhe sin.</p> <p> &Oacute; thaobh fosta&iacute;ochta de, d&uacute;irt an tAire go bhfuil s&eacute; mar sprioc ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta n&iacute;os m&oacute; fosta&iacute;ocht a chruth&uacute; ach, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an fosta&iacute;ocht sin a chruth&uacute; gan n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid i bhfoirm deontais&iacute;.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an bhf&oacute;gra &oacute;n &uacute;dar&aacute;s c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin f&aacute; dtaobh de na 125 post at&aacute; le cruth&uacute; ar Ph&aacute;irc Ghn&oacute; Ghaoth D&oacute;bhair agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtosn&oacute;far ar sin go luath.  Caithfidh m&eacute; comhlacht eile i mo bhaile dh&uacute;chais f&eacute;in a lua.  Sin Randox at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte.  T&aacute; cl&uacute; agus c&aacute;il ag an chomhlacht sin, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa t&iacute;r seo ach tr&iacute;d an domhan go l&eacute;ir.  Fuair an comhlacht sin taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam, thar na blianta at&aacute; amach romhainn nuair a bheidh an m&eacute;id fosta&iacute;ochta ag dul &oacute;n 120 duine at&aacute; ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire go dt&iacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; na 500 duine, go mbeidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta s&aacute;sta tac&uacute; leis an chomhlacht.</p> <p> Leis na focail sin, caithfimid fanacht go dt&iacute; go bhfeicfimid polasa&iacute; an Aire agus an Aire St&aacute;it.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, n&iacute;l anseo ach leath-leathanach n&oacute; alt amh&aacute;in n&oacute; dh&aacute; cheann f&aacute; dtaobh den Ghaeilge agus den Ghaeltacht.  Chuir s&eacute; sin d&iacute;om&aacute; orm, ach tabharfaidh muid deis don Rialtas sna seachtain&iacute; agus m&iacute;onna at&aacute; amach romhainn.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an Rialtas d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin Ghaeilge agus faoin Ghaeltacht.  Gu&iacute;m &aacute;dh m&oacute;r ar an Teach.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta an deis seo a fh&aacute;il chun labhairt ar an nGaeilge c&eacute; go bhfuil f&iacute;or-dh&iacute;oma orm gur ghlac s&eacute; an m&eacute;id seo ama an seans seo a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in tiomanta an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar theanga labhartha in &Eacute;irinn agus a hardr&eacute;im a athbhun&uacute; i socha&iacute; iltheangach.

T&aacute; tr&iacute; Ghaelscoileanna agus Gaelchol&aacute;iste den ch&eacute;ad scoth againn anois.  N&iacute;os l&uacute; na 30 bliain &oacute; shin n&iacute; raibh scoil ar bith tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge againn.  Is iontach an rud &eacute; an t-am at&aacute; inniu ann.  Ach t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; le d&eacute;anamh.  San am at&aacute; amach romhainn, ba ch&oacute;ir n&iacute;os m&oacute; b&eacute;ime a chur ar oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaelach i ngach scoil sa t&iacute;r.  Taca&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in le tumoideachas ag gach leibh&eacute;al sa ch&oacute;ras o&iacute;deachais, go h&aacute;irithe an luath-tumoideachas.</p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; an Gaeloideachas faoi m&oacute;r-&eacute;ileamh agus Gaeilge fl&uacute;irseach ag an-chuid daoine sna S&eacute; Chontae.

Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, t&aacute; go leor r&aacute;ite f&aacute; dtaobh den fhadhb at&aacute; againn agus sin nach bhfuil Aire sinsearach ansin.  Sin fadhb millteanach mh&oacute;r.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh Aire sinsearach freagrach as an nGaeilge agus as an nGaeltacht ag leibh&eacute;al Rialtais agus go mbeadh &eacute;ilimh na gceantar sin agus &eacute;ilimh i nGaeilge &aacute; chloinste&aacute;il ag na hAir&iacute; eile.  N&iacute;l sin ann agus is scannal &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; mhiste go bhfuil Aire St&aacute;it againn agus gur &eacute;irigh leis an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus feabhas a chur ar an nGaeilge a bh&iacute; aige le linn an phr&oacute;isis sin.</p>  <p>  Is tig linn labhairt f&aacute; dtaobh den t&aacute;bhacht leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht agus an stair at&aacute; baint leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; r&aacute;ite ag P&aacute;driag Mac Piarais is a leith&eacute;id mar sin, ach tuigfimid uilig sin.  Deir achan duine sa Pharlaimint seo - achan duine at&aacute; tofa - ar a laghad go bhfuil siad b&aacute;&uacute;il leis an Ghaeilge.

Lena chois sin, t&aacute; Aire sinsearach ag bord an Rialtais a thug an geall&uacute;int sin agus is d&oacute;cha go mbeidh, ar a laghad, Aire s&oacute;isearach - Aire St&aacute;it - fosta.</p>  <p>  An rud a iarraim-se ar an Aire agus &iacute; ag &eacute;isteacht go c&uacute;ramach liom inniu n&aacute; ba ch&oacute;ir di, ar a laghad, nuair at&aacute; na r&aacute;itis seo thart, seasamh suas agus a r&aacute; go gcuirfidh an Rialtas i bhfeidhm na molta&iacute; a chuir muid ar a n-ainm.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin, agus cuirfidh m&eacute; deireadh leis ag an phointe seo, &euro;18 milli&uacute;n sa bhreis a chaitheamh an bhliain seo againn.

However, relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the consumer protection code, code of conduct on mortgage arrears, code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises and the minimum competency code, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, section 48, lending to small and medium sized enterprises regulations 2015, which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p><p>I introduced amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure owners could not do anything which a regulated firm could not do.  Those amendments ensure that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  They also prevent the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action.</p><p>Contravention of these provisions could lead to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules.  Also, the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.  If the owner does not appoint a regulated credit servicing firm to service the credit or the owner wants to undertake some of the functions of credit servicing, then the owner himself or herself must be authorised and regulated.</p><p>Given that the owner is prevented from asking the credit servicing firm to do things which would be prohibited and the regulated credit servicing firm cannot perform the action in any case, it is not clear what additional benefit would accrue by imposing the regulatory requirements on the owner.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>It is clear that the additional regulatory requirements would put additional costs on owners and could inhibit people from taking over ownership of loans or reduce the price that they are willing to pay for them.  The legislation deliberately regulated the interface with the borrower.  The sale of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p><p>The programme for Government provided that, &quot;We will provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities, vulture funds&quot;.  This is a year one action in the programme.  The detailed nature of exactly the greater protections to be provided to mortgage holders, tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities will be decided after further consideration of the issues.  The nature of proposed changes will decide who in the Government will take the lead responsibility for the implementation of these protections.  I do not consider that extending the scope of the credit servicing legislation to owners is the way to go.</p></reply>

The agreement which Fianna F&aacute;il entered into with Fine Gael and the programme for Government Fine Gael has agreed with the Independents refers to the issue of providing greater protection for borrowers, including SMEs, mortgage holders and tenants who occupy properties, regarding loans that have been sold to unregulated entities or vulture funds.  This is the key issue on which I want to focus.  The 2015 legislation is not complete, in that the owner of the loan does not require to be regulated whereas the credit servicing firm and the intermediary does require to be regulated.  The definition in the Act excludes, for example, the determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements.  It is clear that potential consequences arise from the fact that the vulture fund or unregulated entity is outside the ambit of Central Bank regulation and protections and, in our view, this piece of legislation must be amended to take account fully of the issue.</p></speech>

If the owner acts as his or her own agent, he or she is caught in the legislation.  If the owner instructs the regulator to do anything contrary to law, penalties are applied.  Since our last conversation some weeks ago, I have gone over it again and I cannot see the gap in the legislation which the Deputy has indicated exists.  In the interests of the new procedures in the D&aacute;il, I will ask my officials to talk to the Deputy and, if he can identify the gap, I am not averse to an amendment if it is required.</p></speech>

This is the case for tens of thousands of mortgages and SME loans which have been sold by way of portfolios.  While the intermediary firm, the contact point the borrower has - in the case of residential loans it is typically Pepper, for example - is regulated, it is not making the final decisions and calling the shots.  This exposes the borrower to potential risk.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, highlighted this very clearly in its submission on the legislation when it was passed.  I will engage with the Minister's officials.  There is an issue.  The programme for Government commits to asking the central Bank and Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness to examine the legislation.  I would welcome that.</p></speech>

Given that the owner is hands-off in terms of the interface with the borrower, he or she cannot act as the Deputy suggests he or she may.  If the owner crosses the line and begins to act as the Deputy says he or she may act, he or she is caught by the legislation.  If the Deputy is willing to talk to my officials, and if he can convince them it is necessary, I am willing to use an appropriate vehicle to amend the legislation along the lines he suggests.</p></speech>

The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing, or in, arrears on a mortgage which is secured on a primary residence.  Furthermore, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 provides for the regulation of credit servicing firms and, accordingly, the CCMA also applies to such firms which are servicing primary home mortgages held by non-regulated entities.  An addendum to the CCMA was published during 2015 to reflect this fact.</p>  <p>  The CCMA was issued by the Central Bank pursuant to the provisions of section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and regulated entities are required to comply with the provisions of the code as a matter of law.  The CCMA is, therefore, issued under statute and, as stated by the Supreme Court, it forms part of the law.</p><p>The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this code under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942. <br/><br/>As recognised by the programme for Government it is important to keep the provisions of the code, and the wider statutory framework for the protection of consumers of financial services, under review to ensure they remain appropriate to the evolving position of the mortgage market.  As the Deputy is aware, the code has already been reviewed and updated over time and the Government will continue to liaise and work with the Central Bank to ensure that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, continues to be monitored and further updated as necessary in a way that is fair to the legitimate interests of debtors and creditors and, taking account also of appropriate wider public policy considerations, that sustainable solutions will be available to address genuine mortgage difficulty.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i><br/><br/>In addition it is worth noting that my Department has been working with the key Government Departments and agencies to develop co-ordinated communications on mortgage arrears to make distressed borrowers aware of agencies which can offer help.</p></reply>

Can we get to the details of this in the minute that I have available?  David Hall, who has done sterling work on behalf of those in mortgage arrears and who was involved in the programme for Government negotiations, has spoken on national radio about this issue.  It seems some positive elements are emerging from his work there.  He mentioned on the Sean O'Rourke show the commitment in the programme for Government that the Government would work with the Central Bank to amend the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to include an obligation on providers of mortgage credit to provide a range of sustainable arrears solutions, and that is what appeared in the programme for Government.  He went on to say that this means that all customers in arrears will be offered a split mortgage or a mortgage to rent.  Can the Minister confirm that David Hall's interpretation of the outcome of those negotiations is that all those in mortgage arrears will be offered those two options which is a split mortgage and a mortgage to rent?  If that is the case, it is a step in the right direction.  We have been calling for a long time for all options to be offered to those who needed the solutions being offered by the State.</p>  <p>  Also, when will the code of conduct on mortgage arrears be put on a statutory footing?  The Minister will remember that this was an argument I put to him.  It was contained in my Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill and the Minister gave me ample reasons as to why it should not happen.  Can he advise when it will be on a statutory footing?  Will the two solutions I mentioned be part of this and, if so, when is it expected they will be introduced?</p></speech>

What we are talking about now is proposed amendments to the code of conduct.  My commitment is that any amendment would naturally be covered by statute as well, so there would be a statutory basis to it.  The code of conduct has been reviewed already and I am willing to review it again to make it mandatory on lenders to provide the more effective of the range of options that are now in the system to their borrowers.  The two the Deputy mentioned are two that are likely to have a strong uptake but again I am prepared to take the Deputy's advice on that.  The two he mentioned are not exclusive.  If there are others, they may be included.  I am commencing discussions with the Central Bank to see what way this will be formatted.  I assume that when the new finance committee is put in place I will put any draft that we come up with before the Deputy for his consideration and suggestions at that time.</p></speech>

It is David Hall's understanding that those were the two proposals agreed as part of the programme for Government talks.  Can the Minister confirm that, at a minimum, these two proposals will be offered to all distressed borrowers?  Can he also inform us of the advice he got from the Attorney General on this issue?  He made a big play about the unconstitutionality of capping standard variable interest rates and how would that be addressed when property rights would be altered to ensure that lenders had to offer these products?  Crucially, the Minister will know that different financial institutions offer different ranges or versions for split mortgages.  Has he got a particular split mortgage in mind, one on which, for example, an interest rate would not be charged on the part element of it, so to speak?  Are those final details worked out and, crucially, can the Minister outline a pathway as to how this will be introduced and implemented, together with a timeframe, to give borrowers an idea about this as they will be holding off because this is coming down the line?  Can he indicate when this will be implemented?</p></speech>

The two the Deputy mentioned certainly were the principal ones that came up in conversation but there may be others as well.  There is not a draft: it was an acceptance of an issue in principle and now that we have the programme for Government agreed and published we are commencing to work with the Central Bank to format this.  I have had no discussion with the Attorney General about this because, as the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank has very strong powers.  It was it that promulgated the code of conduct in the first instance and I do not see a constitutional difficulty arising.</p></speech>

One of my primary concerns in the area of insurance is that homeowners have access to insurance to cover unforeseen losses, including flooding. </p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance.</p>  <p>  To achieve this aim the OPW is carrying out assessments of 300 areas under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme and each area will have a flood risk management plan, FRMP, by the end of 2016.  Decisions on future investment in relation to flood risk management will be informed by the FRMPs.</p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a memorandum of understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are undertaking research on alternative options with the potential to ensure greater availability of flood insurance.  This will be in the form of a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance in other countries.  This will then feed into a report to Government from the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group which is expected to be completed before the summer.</p></reply>

I know the Government met with the insurance companies in January.  I understand there is an interdepartmental group due to report this month.  The Minister might confirm if that is expected to happen in May.  The key issue that will have to be resolved is the view that the insurance industry is taking with regard to demountable defences.  We are about to spend hundreds of millions of euro as a country rolling out flood relief schemes around the country over the next number of years, which involve demountable defences that are commonly used across Europe that meet the required standard under the European Commission but which are not recognised by the insurance industry as being of the same standard as permanent fixed defences.  That issue will have to be resolved.  I hope the Minister can give an update to the House on that.</p></speech>

It has highlighted that the construction of demountable defences will not increase flood coverage in these areas but rather minimise any further reduction in coverage.  The OPW has advised that there is no European Union standard for flood defence systems and that the OPW has developed the effective national standard.  All OPW major schemes are now built to protect against the one-in-100 fluvial event and, where applicable, the one-in-200-years tidal flood event with additional allowances being made for climate change.  The OPW has also advised that while it looks critically at every design solution to minimise the use of demountable systems, virtually every scheme in a town will have some type of access point for safety reasons, maintenance, recreation or amenity.  This access will usually involve a gate.  This is the situation with any flood defence scheme in any country.  Demountable defences are now an internationally accepted and established measure for providing flood protection as part of publicly funded flood relief schemes.</p></speech>

Demountable defences have proven to be successful in the towns across Ireland where they have been employed, yet they are not recognised by the insurance industry as being of the same standard as permanent defences.  While there is merit in implementing flood defence schemes and protecting towns from flooding, the value of that is diminished if households and businesses in those towns are unable to access flood insurance.  What we need from the Minister is a commitment that if the industry continues to dig its heels in on the issue, the Government is prepared to act.  The Minister will find support across the House if he is prepared to take action to deal with this issue.  As far as I can see, there is a stand off.  I have seen what the insurance industry is saying about demountables, but the net effect is that homes and businesses will remain without flood cover even where we have spent huge sums of money to implement schemes which actually work.</p></speech>

In my view, the attitude of the insurance industry to the provision of insurance where demountable defences have been put in place is now bordering on the ridiculous and cannot be allowed to continue.  Demountable defences are an internationally accepted and established measure for providing flood protection as part of publicly funded flood relief schemes.  They form a critical part of the Bradley and Shrewsbury schemes on the River Severn in the UK and are used in the Netherlands, France, Germany and the USA.  In Austria, demountable defences successfully provided protection to at least 14 cities and towns during the extreme floods along the Danube and Elbe rivers in 2013.  Demountable schemes there were up to 3 km in length and up to 4.6 m in height.  As such, I do not understand the position of insurance companies in Ireland when the international experience shows that demountable defences are very effective and meet the one-in-100 river protection criteria and one-in-200 tidal protection criteria.</p></speech>

Activate is focused exclusively on lending for Irish residential projects and will target, in particular, new residential development in Dublin, the greater Dublin area, Cork, Limerick and Galway which have been identified as the areas of greatest demand.  Activate is a &euro;500 million fund, which is financed through a &euro;325 million loan note provided from ISIF and a &euro;175 million loan note provided from KKR.  The &euro;500 million fund represents the peak funding outlay at any one time.  As borrowings are repaid, additional lending capacity over and above the original &euro;500 million will be created.</p><p>Activate will provide up to 90% of project funding and will provide funding for both the acquisition of land and to bring projects through the planning process.  The Activate base lending rate is approximately 10% and, as would be expected for projects of this nature, there is participation in equity upside if projects are successful so that the fund shares in any gains alongside the project promoter.  The pricing for Activate facilities reflects the provision of up to 90% of overall development cost and the fact that it is, in effect, taking a combination of debt and equity risk.  Activate also offers the advantages of deliverability and speed of execution.  The Activate model is capable of substantially quicker credit turnaround times than current average timeframes in the market on foot of the requirement, typically, for project promoters to deal with more than one lender and sometimes multiple lenders.  It is estimated that Activate will, in this way, be capable of financing the construction of over 11,000 new homes in Ireland.</p><p>Activate has been operationally up and running since January 2016 and in that time has created a significant pipeline of investments.  Activate recently announced the completion of three transactions that will deliver approximately 800 new residential units in the Dublin area.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Activate has stated that a number of other transactions are progressing.  In terms of disclosing the commercial detail around the draw-down or pricing of loans, this is commercially sensitive information and therefore not appropriate for release.</p></reply>

It has many facets, but one essential ingredient in resolving the crisis is the boosting of supply, including private supply.  One of the barriers to increased housing supply by the private sector is access to finance.  I welcomed the fund last year notwithstanding that it had real limitations and I welcome the fact that it has announced its first three projects.  It has been very slow to come on stream and the uptake has not been great so far to say the least.  Hopefully, it will move on from here.</p>  <p>  At a time when the State can borrow ten-year money at less than 1% and given that finance is a key barrier to private housing supply coming on stream at the volume required, there must be a more ambitious way to tackle the issue.  We need to get a new funding model in place so that construction projects can proceed.  The traditional banks are now giving 60% to 70% of the cost of a development by way of a loan and developers and builders are having to access the remainder at very high cost from funds.  The Minister knows that himself.  The fund that is there, welcome as it is, is extremely limited, narrow in focus and not ambitious enough.  I ask the Minister to look at it again, hopefully to redesign it and make it more ambitious.</p></speech>

The fund is only up and running since 1 January 2016 and as such is only five months in operation.  Already, it has funded 800 new homes with a potential to fund 11,000.  There is a roll-over effect as money is repaid and can be lent again.  One can argue about the interest rate, but equity is always dearer than normal lending.  The banks do perhaps 65% after which money gets dearer for the equity piece.  However, the interest rate is being suppressed by arrangements whereby the investor can share in the upside as well as the promoter or building developer.  I see it as only one option.  The new housing committee is considering all aspects of the supply shortage in housing and is also looking at new financial models.  The NTMA is doing some work on possible new models also.  I will keep the Deputy informed if those come to fruition.</p></speech>

That work is badly needed.  We are all well aware of the mistakes made in the banking system overextending itself to the construction industry up to 2007 or 2008 and nobody is advocating a repeat of that history.  However, we now have the opposite problem that access to finance is a huge issue.  If we are going to bring private housing supply to the level we need it to be at, we must tackle this issue.  I welcome the suppressing of the interest rate under the Activate Capital fund albeit it is still high.  However, that is only part of the overall funding mix for any particular development.</p><p> We need a new and more ambitious model.  People looking in on us will point out that the State can avail of historically low interest rates on its borrowings.  Given the fact this is the most important issue facing us, more can be done.  I would support any initiative that helps to provide credit for viable and credit-worthy projects.</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly stated, the model for building houses is broken.  Many of the small builders in the supply stream went bust and have not returned to the business since the economy's recovery.  The finance model is also gone.  As such, we must find new ways.  As can be seen in Dublin, most current construction involves a developer as an organiser, with subcontractors carrying out the work.  Units of subcontractors are coming on stream when their input is required.  There has been a major shake-up but the industry is getting there and a number of good, sound builders are back in business.  Some of the larger builders are also involved, for example, Cairn Homes and Hines in Cherrywood, where there are 4,800 units.  They have a different financing model, as they can raise money on the markets quite cheaply.</p></speech>

As I have stated previously, I see no benefit in making an application for retrospective use of the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI.  During the period between June 2012, when the agreement was reached regarding retrospective recapitalisation, and December 2014, when the DRI tool became operational, the Irish economy recovered significantly and the options available to the State to recover its money invested in the banks expanded.  This remains the case, with investors now willing to support Irish banks, the institutions having begun to repay capital to the State and the market value of our investments having improved accordingly.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions attaching to the use of the DRI are onerous, as it is designed to be used almost as a last resort after the creditor waterfall has been applied and other options have been exhausted.  Moreover, the mechanics behind a potential retrospective application of the instrument, if such a decision could be agreed, would likely be equally if not more onerous and would not be in the best interests of the State at this time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the operational framework of the DRI includes stringent conditionality and any application would need to be unanimous among the other 18 ESM governors.  Achieving such an outcome for a deal that valued our investments at a level significantly above what we might achieve in the market is unlikely, particularly given the strength of our economic recovery since 2012 and the other concessions won by Ireland in recent years.</p>  <p>  The disposal of our bank assets is a process that will likely take place over a number of years and the best avenue to do this is through the financial markets.  I have said before that my interest is in recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer from these assets over time but current market conditions are not conducive to achieving this objective.  Fortunately, given that our public finances are once again on the right path, we are not under pressure to dispose of these assets in the short term.</p></reply>

The Minister went to Brussels, spoke to the media and said that this was off the agenda for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  He has just repeated that.  While he stated "I have said before", he left out the crucial words "at this time".  He is now saying that it is no longer on the agenda.  Many of us suspected that it was never on the agenda or had not been on the Minister's agenda for a long time.  He was trying to take the Irish people with him knowing full well that he was not going to make an application.</p>  <p>  This is too serious an issue to be left at that.  We are discussing a large amount of money that we pumped into AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The Minister went to extreme lengths to get Angela Merkel out to tell the Irish people how special we were.  He talked about the game changer that was getting the words "retrospective recapitalisation" written into the articles.</p>  <p>  What reports, evaluations and types of consideration have gone into making the decision that we will no longer apply for retrospective recapitalisation?  The Minister claims that achieving it or getting it at above what the market could offer might be difficult but what work has he done to find out what his counterparts on the ESM board would consider offering were we to apply for retrospective recapitalisation?  This is a significant amount of money for the State and the matter should be considered thoroughly.  What considerations, reports and evaluations have been made and what work has the Minister done with his counterparts to arrive at his assessment?</p></speech>

One need not do much study to know that the potential for acquiring a great deal of capital through the sale of bank shares on the markets is now a more valuable option than going through a reluctant ESM, which requires unanimity among governors - in other words, finance Ministers - across the eurozone.</p>  <p>  As to the evaluation, I spoke formally with the people involved in the ESM and asked about the potential.  They pointed out that an application could be made but that it would require unanimous assent.  Given my soundings over the year, I do not believe that we would have got virtually any support.  Circumstances have changed dramatically and we are now the fastest growing economy of the 28 in the EU.  We are certainly the fastest growing in the eurozone and are projected by the Commission to be the fastest growing again next year.  We have the better option of going to the market when the time is right to recover the money that the taxpayer invested in the banks.</p>  <p>  Within the Department, in particular given the preparations for an IPO of AIB, much evaluation work has been done.  That advice is available to me.</p></speech>

I said that the Government was holding the ball in its hands and was facing an open goal and that all it needed to do was put the ball in the back of the net but it has screwed that up royally.  While we always knew that there was a need for unanimity and that the shares would be transferred, what was not known and is still not known is the value that would be attributed to the shares by the ESM.  As we exited the recession and the economy picked up, it was always going to be more difficult to achieve that.  For a long time, an application for an ESM recapitalisation of all of the banks - nothing in the Minister's statement claims that it must just be for the pillar banks - could have been made.</p>  <p>  The House has major debates about selling shares in our airlines that are valued at a fraction of the assets that we hold in AIB and yet a Minister is deciding without any scrutiny that an option that is available to the State as we speak - it may not be achievable, but it is available - is off the table.  The assets are worth in the region of &euro;40 billion.  This is not an acceptable way to do politics.  The matter should be referred to a committee so that all of the options might be discussed-----</p></speech>

The Deputy is wrong in his analysis of what happened.  We kept the matter under review and the banks are now functioning well.  They are almost back to normality.  They are quite profitable and valuable, but I have no intention of selling the shares until I am convinced we will get best value for the taxpayer.  However, there is value in the banks and it is a question of when and how we will realise it.  What I have indicated so far as a matter of policy is that the first step will be an IPO of 25% of AIB, but market conditions are not right.  If we were to do it in the last quarter of this year, we would need to take steps now that the market might see as irrevocable.  Therefore, it will be the first half of next year before an opportunity arises.</p></speech>

NAMA provided a presentation for the committee which outlined, among other useful information, the progress on its residential funding programme. The presentation is available on the Oireachtas and NAMA websites.  Specifically, NAMA's key residential delivery figures are as follows:</p><blockquote>- 2,768 units have been completed since early 2014; <br /><br />- I am advised that, of the 20,000 units NAMA plans to fund by 2020, subject to commercial viability, 2,500 have been scheduled for delivery in the period from October 2015, when the target was announced, to the end of 2016 - intensive planning and other preparatory work under way will result in a significant increase in the number of completed units in 2017 and later years;<br /><br />- at present, 3,096 units are under construction;<br /><br />- planning permission has been granted for a further 5,176 units, while a planning application has been lodged for a further 5,066 units;<br /><br />- planning applications are expected to be lodged within the next year for an additional 6,627 units.</blockquote><p>Therefore, it is clear that NAMA has a strong residential development pipeline of sites securing its loans.  It has an active strategy for every acre of land under its control and I expect the agency to continue to progress towards its publicly stated target of delivering 20,000 units by the end of 2020 through working with key stakeholders to advance such sites through the planning and development phases.  I note that the NAMA chairman stated at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness that the plan to deliver 20,000 new units was ambitious and challenging, but NAMA will carry it out in a manner consistent with its mandate.  It is clear that the progress highlighted to date and the viable pipeline for future delivery justify NAMA's confidence in this regard.</p></reply>

I have been asked by the Deputy to ask the Minister whether he plans to revise the proportion that will be delivered as social housing.  As the Minister knows from the debate last night and all the debates taking place, many more people will find themselves in trouble with mortgages.  Therefore, there will be a greater need for social housing throughout the country.  It would be appropriate, as a consequence, to revise upwards the proportion delivered as social housing.  Is it the intention of the Minister to do so considering the current crisis and the crisis we will face in the future?  All the indications are that more evictions will, unfortunately, take place in the coming year.  That is something we all need to avoid.</p></speech>

It is not a matter for NAMA to determine the proportion of social housing that will be provided.  The allocation of social housing units per development is prescribed by Part V of the Planning and Development Act at 10% of on-site units.  As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA's commitment to funding residential development is not one to build or fund social housing units.  In line with NAMA's mandate, under section 10 of the NAMA Act, it is an intention to fund the delivery of private residential units on lands securing NAMA debtor loans on a commercial basis in order to maximise NAMA's recovery on these loans.  NAMA borrowers developing these sites will, of course, fulfil their Part V obligations to deliver 10% of residential units in the form of on-site social housing units. Given that the ultimate intention is to deliver 20,000 units, the corresponding 2,000 social units will be significant.  These matters are being reviewed by the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  If it recommends a higher quota for private developments, a percentage higher than 10%, it will then be a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government who is responsible for housing to change the Planning and Development Act, including Part V.  If he does, NAMA will comply.</p></speech>

I accept that we must await the recommendations of the housing committee but, judging by what we know will happen, it is extremely important that the proportion of social housing be increased.  That is why Deputy Michael McGrath asked me to ask the Minister whether it was the intention of NAMA to increase it.</p></speech>

It is involved in the promotion of private housing developments.

I have noted the widespread concern across the House about insurance costs and noted the D&aacute;&iacute;l statements made on that day.  The ability of the Government to influence insurance practices and pricing is limited as insurance companies are required under European law to price in accordance with risk.  Neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  However, that does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that may in the longer term lead to a better claims environment that would facilitate a reduction in claim costs.</p>  <p>  The cost of insurance is a complex issue involving a number of parties, including Departments, State bodies and private sector organisations.  My Department's review of policy in the insurance sector is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland and other Departments and agencies and external stakeholders.  The objective of the review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  The first phase of the review deals with the motor insurance compensation framework and this work is nearing completion.  The next phase will deal directly with the issue of insurance costs and include an examination of the factors which contribute to the current rise in insurance premiums.  The availability of relevant and timely data for the insurance sector to facilitate an in-depth analysis of the issues is also a matter to be addressed as the current lack of data presents difficulties from a policy analysis and development perspective.</p>  <p>  The review of policy in the insurance sector will continue in the coming months and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  The final report will be presented to the Government in due course.</p></reply>

The official statistics from the CSO show increases of 34% in the past 12 months.  Premiums are up by a whopping 60% since January 2014.  I accept that the Government does not control motor insurance premiums.  As the Minister knows, I have advocated for the reinstatement of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which was very successful, but as outlined in his response, he has opted instead for a Department-led review.  When the motor insurance element is completed - he signalled that he expects it to be completed shortly - could it lead to policy initiatives or will he wait for the entire review to be completed?</p><p>As the Minister indicated, the review is likely to be completed towards the end of the year.</p></speech>

Many factors are involved in the dramatic escalation in motor insurance premiums, including court awards, the  need for a review of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, legal costs, false and exaggerated claims, regulatory oversight and the lack of transparency regarding the profits earned by insurance companies.  All these issues must be examined.  While the industry has a role to play in this regard and must have its voice heard, the voice of consumers also needs to be heard.  Deputies hear day in and day out about dramatic increases in motor insurance premiums.  These increase are occurring across the board but younger drivers and the owners of older vehicles in particular are being hammered by increases in insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  The current rate of increase is not sustainable as it will act as a drag on the economy and impact on the business community.  We need to get to the bottom of the factors driving the increases and then tackle them.  I encourage the Minister to arrange a further debate in the House as soon as motor insurance aspect of the review has been completed.  I hope some degree of consensus would then be reached on the steps required to arrest the increase in premiums and hopefully reduce them.</p></speech>

In respect of the ILCU proposal, I have been informed that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government met representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions in December 2015 to discuss its proposal to fund social housing developments.  There have been a number of follow up meetings between officials from my Department and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to consider any potential regulatory or legislative implications of credit unions becoming involved  in social housing funding.  In addition, a meeting was held between the Central Bank and the Departments of Environment, Community and Local Government and Finance on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature on social housing funding arrangements.  This was done with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it is the body which deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  Two alternative models of funding were proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions in respect of social housing and it was determined that the second of the two models would be best placed to achieve the objective of providing a mechanism for investment in social housing without negatively impacting on the general Government balance and keeping the funding off balance sheet.  It was agreed that ILCU would progress the preferred model, with both Departments indicating their availability should any assistance be required regarding technical advice or further information.  Officials from my Department also met representatives of CUDA on 8 April 2016 to assist in progressing its proposal on social housing.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator of credit unions.  Any decision regarding credit unions providing such funding would ultimately require regulatory approval prior to implementation.</p></reply>

I did not catch the details of this model but perhaps the Minister will expand a little on it.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for the regulation of credit unions.  The issue, however, is whether the Government views the proposals from the credit unions as a desirable policy direction, as this would significantly influence the level of engagement by the Registrar of Credit Unions with the credit union sector in advancing the proposal.  Is the onus for developing a vehicle for funding the delivery of social housing on the credit union sector or would it work in partnership with the Departments of Finance and Environment, Community and Local Government to develop its proposed model?</p></speech>

I asked these questions because partnership will be key to having the Registrar of Credit Unions determine whether regulation is required to allow the proposal to proceed.</p></speech>

While credit unions have significant funds on hand, we should remember that these funds are their members' savings.  The regulator in the Central Bank would be averse to the credit union movement putting these savings at risk and would clearly assess any proposal from credit unions to fund housing against the potential risk to savings.  This does not mean the proposal would have to be ruled out.  Other lenders can manage risk and credit unions would have to do likewise.</p>  <p>  I am actively encouraging the proposal and my officials have held meetings with representatives of the credit union movement and Central Bank of Ireland.  The onus is now on the two credit union representative organisations to produce proposals.  These will then be assessed and my Department will co-operate with them in every way.  However, the final call will be made by the Central Bank because the supervisor of credit unions is located in the Central Bank.  </p></speech>

Is this the most desirable approach to this process?  If the Department considers credit union involvement in social housing desirable, why should the onus be placed on the Irish League of Credit Unions to develop the model and the logistics for implementing it?  Surely this could be done in partnership with those who have expertise in this area, for example, the Central Bank or Department of Finance.</p></speech>

On 12 May 2016, NAMA's chairman advised the Committee on Housing and Homelessness that almost all of the 6,000 residential units owned by NAMA debtors are occupied by tenants.  I assume the Deputy's question does not refer to the use of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for tenanted units, as such action would displace existing tenants.  NAMA related residential units which are vacant are available for sale in the market by NAMA's debtors and receivers at market value.</p>  <p>  Compulsory purchase orders allow a relevant statutory body to acquire an asset at market value from an otherwise unwilling seller.  CPO powers are not necessary in the case of NAMA related residential units as such units are being sold willingly at market value and are, therefore, available to be purchased by local authorities or housing bodies.</p><p>CPOs allow a relevant statutory body to acquire an asset at market value from an otherwise unwilling seller.  CPO powers are not necessary in the case of NAMA-related residential units, as such units are being sold willingly at market value and so are available to be purchased by local authorities or housing bodies.</p> <p> Separately, NAMA has made a significant contribution towards social housing supply through its policy of providing first option to State bodies on the purchase of property.  NAMA offered 6,637 residential units, the totality of NAMA's vacant housing stock at the time, to local authorities for social housing.  Local authorities confirmed demand for 2,540 of these units, of which 2,042 have been provided for social housing at a cost to NAMA of more than &euro;250 million.  NAMA has no role in determining which of these units are taken up for social housing.  That is a matter for the local authorities and housing bodies.  I also understand that NAMA is currently re-examining its remaining portfolio to identify if any additional units may be available to offer to local authorities.</p></reply>

Edmund Honohan attended the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness and what he said was very interesting.  We all know how compulsory purchase orders have been used in the case of developing roads and other infrastructure but he put forward an imaginative suggestion that they could be used in the case of NAMA and of vulture funds.  He suggested that where houses, with tenants or otherwise, are being sold from under the feet of people, the State should be able to come in and purchase those houses rather than have to add these people to the housing lists and go through the system of rehousing them.  It should intervene at the time of the crisis.</p>  <p>  We had a presentation on this crisis today in the AV room.  The crisis is huge, is escalating and we cannot hide from it.  Hundreds of repossession cases per day are lined up for the courts.  Legislation in other jurisdictions, in America in particular, ensures the vulture funds and others must take the good with the bad.  Interventions are made and properties are bought back from them, despite the fact they bought them at rock down prices in order to make a killing.  These other jurisdictions buy these properties back under this kind of legislation.  If people are living in them, they can continue as tenants and if not, the properties are provided to people who are homeless.</p></speech>

If they were to help in resolving the housing crisis, they would need to be buying vacant properties.  They do not look for vacant possession because of, as we can see, the adverse implications of that.</p>  <p>  If there was a supply of vacant housing, local authorities should certainly apply that for social housing.  However, the supply of vacant and available property is limited.  NAMA has some vacant and available supply and offered that to local authorities.  Sometimes local authorities do not have money, so NAMA has a kind of special purpose vehicle that leases property to a local authority on a 20-year basis.  I believe it is leasing approximately 1,600 houses on that basis currently and there may be further potential in this regard.  The CPO route acquires property at market value from an unwilling vendor.  NAMA is not an unwilling vendor but wants to sell what it has at market value.</p></speech>

We need some kind of imaginative examination of the situation to give some indication to people being made homeless that the Government is doing something to find a solution.  We want some indication vulture funds are not just being allowed to come in and sweep up these properties.  Our nearest neighbour across the pond has proposed legislation in this regard now.  Are we just going to wring our hands and accuse people like Deputy Michael McGrath who introduced this type of Bill last night of scaremongering while doing nothing ourselves?  We cannot sit idly by any longer.  This crisis is going to overwhelm us because action has been put off time after time.  Deputy Noonan is as well aware as I am of the situation and that repossession cases are lining up for the courts.  There is significant angst, anxiety, sickness and trauma.  Indeed, it seems like terrorism from the institutions of State for people in this situation.  Surely we can use CPOs or some other imaginative legislation to try to secure properties, especially from vulture funds which are not buying them at market value but trying to make a killing on them, whether vacant or otherwise.</p>  <p>  We must think outside the box here.  The Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness is discussing the problem and other groups are also trying to address the problem.  What good will that do if the Oireachtas does not legislate imaginatively to create a new solution? </p></speech>

I appeared before the committee and it seems to be that it is doing constructive work and moving quickly through its agenda.  At the same time, Deputy Simon Coveney has been given special responsibility as Minister to resolve the housing crisis.  He is moving as quickly as possible on that and one of the first Cabinet sub-committees to have been set up is the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  This committee has met already and will meet again this coming Friday.  There is a lot happening.  Nobody has a monopoly on ideas to solve this problem.

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high, that it is acting as a disincentive for work and investment in Ireland and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so.</p><p>In the programme for a partnership Government, there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners and limits the benefits for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners. </p><p>As outlined in the programme for a partnership Government, the reductions in personal tax rates, such as the phasing out of the USC, needed to reward work and support enterprise and employment will be funded largely through: extra revenues from not indexing personal tax credits and bands; the removal of PAYE tax credit for high earners and other measures to ensure the tax system remains fair and progressive; higher excise duties on cigarettes and increased enforcement and sanctions on the illegal importation and sale of cigarettes; increased enforcement and sanctions on fuel laundering; a new tax on sugar sweetened drinks; and improving tax compliance.</p><p>The medium-term income tax reform plan is to be published for consultation with the Oireachtas committee on finance in July or August and will be put to the Oireachtas for consideration and approval in October.  The plan is being developed over the next number of weeks and, as such, the expected cost is not yet finalised.  The Revenue Commissioners have published a ready reckoner on their website, which provides estimates of costings for various tax changes.  For example, the full year cost of abolishing the 1% USC rate is &euro;237 million, while the full year cost of reducing the 5.5% USC rate to 4.5% is &euro;348 million.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The income tax reform plan will aim to support job creation and reward work which is a key driver of growth and prosperity in the economy.  In developing the plan, available resources will be a key consideration along with safeguarding the economic stability of the public finances and the wider economy.</p></reply>

The Minister is aware from parliamentary questions we have put to him over quite a period now that we have been examining the issue of tax credits while leaving the USC in place.</p>  <p>  I believe abolishing the USC is a reckless proposal.  We will have opportunities to debate this issue during the Finance Bill and throughout the period leading to the budget.  Fine Gael says we can afford to abolish it but we cannot afford it.  There is ample evidence across the State to show we cannot afford it.  While Fianna F&aacute;il present's the Fine Gael plan as reckless and its plan as great, the idea of taking &euro;3 billion a year out of the tax net through its plan is equally reckless.  The Fine Gael plan is just a bit worse.  We cannot afford this.</p>  <p>  It is actually quite funny to listen to both parties talk about how we need to invent special vehicles so we can spend more money on social housing.</p><p>We need to spend more money on social housing but we cannot because we agreed to the fiscal compact, which limits the amount of money we have to spend.  However, if one takes &euro;4 billion per year out of the tax net it is further reduced.  What is the level of economic risk analysis with regard to this policy proposal in the programme for Government?</p></speech>

It is not the first time we have debated it.  It was debated last year and was debated right through the general election.  Deputy Michael McGrath's and the Fianna F&aacute;il position is not too far away from the Fine Gael position.  He pitched middle income people as earning less that &euro;80,000 and Fine Gael defined it as less than &euro;70,000.  The Labour Party position is not very different either.  The three traditional parties, if you will forgive me for calling them that, are in and around the same space.</p></speech>

I sat on the Banking Inquiry and we saw the graphs.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government of the time cut income tax, the most stable tax available, and it was replaced by other taxes.  The USC will bring in &euro;4.6 billion in 2020 and a full debate is nonsense without a full analysis of the costings, etc.  The idea of coming in year after year and tinkering with the charge so that it goes after five years is wrong.  This is a policy decision that needs proper economic assessment in terms of the risk to this economy.</p>  <p>  I believe what Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are proposing is reckless.  If we have learned anything from the last catastrophe this State faced it is that one does not reduce taxes to this level.  It may be affordable today because we have a boost in corporation tax and other taxes but it is not affordable in the long term.  Every penny we take out of the USC is a penny we are not investing in health or social housing.  I ask the Minister to commit to a proper economic analysis of the risks of this policy rather than just a debate in this Chamber.</p></speech>

Mineral oil and tobacco smuggling are crimes that require both national and international responses.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it works closely with law enforcement partners both at home and abroad to disrupt and deter smuggling activities.  Revenue co-operates extensively with, <i>inter alia</i>, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against illicit trades.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through cross-Border enforcement groups to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of these forms of criminality.  There is close co-operation with other international law enforcement agencies, in particular HM Revenue and Customs in the UK.</p><p>As has been reiterated in the programme for a partnership Government, the work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime will be supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of A Fresh Start, the Stormont agreement and implementation plan, of the joint agency task force, which includes Revenue.  In this context the development of strategic and tactical plans has been agreed by all key stakeholders to further support effective action against cross-Border excise fraud.  This interagency national and international co-operation is complemented by Revenue's use of intelligence gathering, its profiling of suspects and effective intervention programmes to counter the threat posed by criminal activities such as fuel and tobacco fraud.  </p><p>Over the past number of years Revenue has implemented a number of strategies against both fuel fraud and the illegal tobacco trade, underpinned by an extensive and effective legislative framework to maximise its impact on the illegal operations referred to in the Deputy's question.  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against fuel and tobacco offences, and I am assured by Revenue that action against such activities will continue to be a key focus of its work.</p></reply>

A year ago, I introduced legislation in this House calling for the establishment of a cross-Border multitask agency to deal with this illicit trade.  I recognise and welcome the fact that some of the measures proposed in the Fresh Start agreement follow some of what we proposed.  In view of the ongoing illicit trade and loss of revenue to our State, however, can the Minister now give further consideration to the establishment of a single cross-Border agency encompassing representatives of the Minister's Department, Customs and Excise, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Environmental Protection Agency with their counterparts in the appropriate statutory authorities north of the Border?  Not alone does the illegal trade in fuel, tobacco products and other products cause loss of revenue to the State and huge damage to legitimate businesses, particularly small businesses, there is also a threat to our environment with the dumping of sludge and material arising from the washing of diesel.  It will cause damage to the reputation of our farming industry as well, and the authenticity and provenance of our food production can be threatened by this dumping of sludge and other raw materials.  I hope the Minister will give further consideration to the establishment of a cross-Border agency to ensure we stamp out the illicit trade which is doing so much damage to so many people and to society.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; agus is c&uacute;is n&aacute;ire &eacute; go bhfuil B&eacute;arla &aacute; labhairt againn inniu agus go mb&iacute;onn gn&oacute; na D&aacute;la ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla in ionad Gaeilge.  Is c&uacute;is n&aacute;ire &iacute; cinnte nach bhfuil Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt againn beagnach 90 bliain tar &eacute;is tosach an St&aacute;it.</p>  <p>  We know the historical reasons we speak English, namely, the effect of the Famine, the effect of migration when so many Irish speakers died or left, the education system under Britain which undermined Irish, the growing perception that speaking Irish would not enhance one's job prospects and that English was the language of progress.  When we think of the Easter Rising and the War of Independence, the leaders and the members spoke Irish and had a great love of Irish and yet Irish is not the language of the majority of the population.  Government after Government since the foundation of the State has failed to encourage and spread the use of the language.</p>  <p>  Is &iacute; an fadhb at&aacute; againn anois n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon fheabhas tagtha ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus anois n&iacute; labhra&iacute;onn ach mionlach sa t&iacute;r seo an Ghaeilge.  Roimh an nGorta M&oacute;r bh&iacute; Gaeilge mar an gc&eacute;ad teanga ag beagnach 7 milli&uacute;n duine.  Anois labhra&iacute;onn n&iacute;os l&uacute; n&aacute; 20,000 Gaeilge gach l&aacute;.</p>  <p>  If we are to bring about an improvement in the use of the Irish language, we must start young.  Ceapaim go mba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh gach bunscoil mar Ghaelscoil i gcomhar ceithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig bliana ar a laghad.  Ansin bheadh gach dalta scoile in ann labhairt as Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  Another language could be introduced for the final two to three years at primary school because we know that children are like sponges at that stage.  The common denominator with all languages is that language has to be taught to be spoken.  Under the present system, children will learn Irish for eight years in primary school, three to six years in second level and will still leave the education system unable to conduct a conversation in Irish and, even more disappointing, many not liking Irish and having no pride in Irish as being part of our cultural identity.  Cinnte t&aacute; job s&aacute;rmhaith &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag na Gaeilscoileanna, go h&aacute;irithe na cinn at&aacute; lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Rud eile dearfach: t&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil suim ag tuismitheoir&iacute; go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaelscoileanna againn.  We have to look at the way Irish is taught in our schools.  Ba cheart go mbeidh na ranganna beomhar agus praitici&uacute;il.  The emphasis has to be on spoken Irish.  There has to be a conversation with the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue, otherwise why bother teaching Irish.  I say that as somebody who loves Irish.  Unless we are going to take it seriously, we should throw our hat at it at this stage.  I believe it is more beneficial to have the majority with a love of the language and able to speak it rather than have a few being super competent in Irish with the majority being left with a distaste for the language.</p>  <p>  In December 2010, we had the publication of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  What has been achieved in the first five years?  It is strong on rhetoric and aspirations but very weak on implementation and action.  I accept there were specific structures for the setting up a number of committees.  Unless there is implementation, committees are merely talking shops.  It speaks volumes, unfortunately, that in the last Government, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, could not conduct business regarding the Gaeltacht in the Irish language.  I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to make up for that shortfall.  One has to ask how </p>  <p>serious an issue it is that the Minister whose first language is not Irish has responsibility for the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  Yesterday I attended a presentation from Conradh na Gaeilge, chaired by Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, in the AV room.  It highlighted various positive signs from a number of surveys which indicated that at least 2 million people have some level of Irish, that 61% agree with additional support for the language and that 70% agree on the need for services through Irish to be in place for those who want those services.  As we are trying to provide services in their own language for our new communities, there is a responsibility on us to provide those services in Irish for those who want them.  Other points that emerged from the surveys included bilingual labelling and that the names of Government agencies and semi-State bodies should be in Irish.  To bring all of this about requires leadership, commitment, compassion and investment.  After that, it requires monitoring of the implementation of the strategy.</p><p>I understand this issue is competing with a wide range of issues at Cabinet level but this has gone on far too long if we are serious about spreading Irish as a spoken language throughout the country and not confining it to Gaeltacht areas.  I am struck by the widespread illiteracy rates in Cuba before the revolution.  However, when the revolutionaries took over, there was a massive campaign to address this and there is now a literacy museum in Havana.  Hundreds of volunteer teachers travelled throughout Cuba and within a few years, there was an amazing change with phenomenal improvement.  I wonder if we could have a similar system in Ireland.  We have an example with our neighbours in Wales.  When travelling in Wales, one is more likely to hear Welsh being spoken even though it is a minority UK language.  Their education system has adopted the approach of the language as part of their culture identity.  There is a Welsh language commissioner who examines legislation with regard to implications for the language.</p> <p> The surveys we heard about yesterday showed that more than six in ten respondents agree there are not many opportunities for young people to use their Irish outside the formal education system.  The question must be asked as to how a change can be brought about to address that.  I believe that young people have to be involved and that their practical solutions listened to.  We know that we are not going to have a senior Minister for the Irish language, as had been sought, but I hope we will see an Oireachtas committee for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands.  These three areas are under threat, not quite of extinction but under severe pressure, with regard to viability and sustainability.  The committee has to take on the monitoring of the implementation of the strategy to ensure services through Irish are protected and to look at legislation to protect the language.  It is vital that the Minister for Education and Skills supports educational measures with regard to the Irish language.</p> <p> Bh&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh orm nuair a bh&iacute;os ag freastal ar an me&aacute;nscoil go raibh m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; Gaeilge agam a spreag ionam, agus i mo chairde, gr&aacute; don teanga.  Is teanga &aacute;lainn &iacute; an Ghaeilge &ndash; an litr&iacute;ocht, an fhil&iacute;ocht agus an ceol.  Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don obair iontach at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag TG4, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus Raidi&oacute; na Life i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus na cl&aacute;ir tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in eile.  Ceapaim nach bhfuil s&eacute; r&oacute;-dh&eacute;anach an teanga a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il ach t&aacute; easpa deifre ann leis an obair seo.  Braitheann s&eacute; ar an tiomantas don Ghaeilge agus ar infheist&iacute;ocht sa Ghaeilge.</p></speech>

There is a phrase with which every child from Kilkenny is familiar and it is probably the most Irish that any of them have, which is, t&aacute; &aacute;thas ormsa an corn seo a ghlacadh ar son fhoireann Chill Chainnigh.  I believe that every child in Kilkenny probably knows that phrase.  Like them, I too went to school for 14 years and while it might be debatable and some people would raise serious objections, I do not think I was a particularly bad student in school.  It is amazing that after 14 years of education and 14 years of learning Irish I, and the vast majority of students who have gone through our education system, came out of it without the ability to speak our language.  That is a shocking indictment of the way Irish is taught.  I say this as someone who used to be a teacher in a previous life, albeit a maths teacher.</p><p>I can understand Irish.  If somebody is speaking who is not from Donegal, I can understand it very clearly, with significant apologies to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  I have nothing against Donegal people, it is just that their variation of Irish is more difficult to understand - their variation of English is more difficult to understand as well.</p> <p> We need to have a serious examination of how so many students can come through an education system which works very well for most other subjects and yet, after 14 years, they cannot speak the language.  There are many Irish words that come into the English language in my part of the world, and one of them is "meas".  There is no meas placed on Irish in the education system, perhaps because parents and families do not see it as a valuable part of the development of their child and the ability of their child to have a career in the future.  However, it is a significant cultural issue, and I say that as someone who can read the language and understand others speaking it, but who cannot converse in it, although I would dearly love to be able to do so.  I do not think I would have the patience of Deputy McHugh to go back at this stage to re-learn Irish and I commend him for doing that.  However, I believe we have to examine our education system to ensure children who go through it are at least fluent in conversational Irish when they leave school.</p> <p> I have heard various suggestions, including that there should be two different Irish subjects on the curriculum, one more conversational in nature and one more theoretical.  That might be one solution, although I do not pretend to have particular solutions to this subject, which has been discussed at length in this House and in other places over the years.  It is worth pointing out that one of the great successes in our education system has been the Gaelscoileanna movement.  My first cousin, who is also from County Kilkenny, is principal of a Gaelscoil.  He learned Irish and can speak it and teach it, and I believe the fact he went to a Gaelscoil was key for him.  We need to resource that movement, particularly into second level, which it has already expanded into but where it will expand further in the future.  Most importantly, the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, with whom I have not had this discussion yet but will do so shortly, needs to examine the whole methodology of teaching our national language if it is to survive into the future, which I sincerely hope it does.</p></speech>

C&eacute;ad bliain tar &eacute;is &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca, t&aacute; s&eacute; de dhualgas orainn n&iacute;os a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</p>  <p>  Our national language is an immeasurable cultural treasure.  A century on from the foundation of our Republic, the need to revitalise the effort to secure and develop the use of the Irish language is particularly important.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm that the outgoing Government lacked any real commitment to our language or the protection of language rights.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party continuously downgraded the status of the Irish language.  The successful roll-out of an ambitious strategy for the Irish language requires ongoing leadership and funding.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-th&aacute;bhactach that such leadership is provided by the new Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il made sure that the confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael contained a commitment to increase investment in the Irish language.</p>  <p>  Cloisimid go minic na focail &oacute; Ph&aacute;draig Pearse: "T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam."  Is d&oacute;igh liom gur cheart d&uacute;inn smaoineamh ar na focail sin.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint conas forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh ar an nGaeilge chun a chinnti&uacute; go mbeimid &aacute;balta an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</p>  <p>  Teasta&iacute;onn uaim c&uacute;pla pointe a dh&eacute;anamh, ag tos&uacute; le scoileanna.  We should consider providing learning opportunities to parents to refresh their Irish and help their children.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhactach deiseanna foghlama a thabhairt do thuismitheoir&iacute;.  Perhaps this should be extended to all adults who would like to refresh their Irish.  We should have a campaign this year to promote learning Irish, which should be done by providing more activities as Gaeilge as children often learn Irish in school but do not speak it outside school hours.  There are many good people, like Br. Michael Broderick in my own town of Newbridge, who facilitate weekly conversational Irish gatherings to encourage adults to learn Irish in a friendly environment.  We definitely need more of that.</p>  <p>  We also need to further promote the Ghn&oacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge scheme.  Where it is most obvious that Irish can be spoken, we need to move to a situation in our towns and cities, as well as in Gaeltacht areas, in which people can undertake their daily business in Irish if they so wish.</p>  <p>  As a graduate of many Irish colleges when I was younger, and having enjoyed a hugely positive, sociable and enjoyable cultural experience, I believe the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh have a huge role to play in putting the fun back into the learning of an Ghaeilge.  However, as many of those who run the colleges will say, there is a huge amount of red tape for parents who host the students.  We need more focus on providing and facilitating these courses, and not only in Gaeltacht areas because there could also be more of a role for Gaelscoileanna across the country.</p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; mar gheall ar Ghaeilge san Eoraip.  Since 2007 Irish has been an official language of the EU, with this having been negotiated by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  As a former member of the Committee of the Regions, I am extremely proud of the fact Irish can be spoken, not only in European Parliament plenary sessions, but also in Committee of the Regions plenary sessions.  This possibility has been used by Irish members at every plenary session.  The importance cannot be underestimated of providing an opportunity for Irish elected members to speak their language in a European setting.</p>  <p>  The derogation for the language in the EU is soon coming to an end and I was delighted to see, in the past few weeks, a call for 62 Irish translators and 13 Irish linguistic assistants to add to the 50-plus positions already created since 2007.  In total, this will have provided over 180 opportunities for Irish speakers in Brussels.  What is also interesting in this context is that the amount of Irish being spoken in social circles in Brussels has drastically increased over the past few years, and perhaps there are some lessons for us at home in that regard.  Through the power of Facebook and social media, I take great pride in watching my two little nieces in Shanghai absorbing themselves in Irish culture, dance and song, and taking huge pride in their Irish identity abroad.</p>  <p>  TG4 was a game changer in Irish language development, with many companies developing programming as Gaeilge.  The reality is that in many of our smaller towns and communities, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, Irish will not survive unless there is job creation in those areas.  While &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is active, its budget has been drastically cut over recent years.  There needs to be a focus on providing small-scale jobs, not only in tourism, in Gaeltacht areas and across rural communities the length and breadth of the country.</p>  <p>  What are the key priorities for Fianna F&aacute;il?  We believe a senior Minister should be appointed with primary responsibility for Gaeltacht and Irish language affairs as well as the establishment of a full Oireachtas committee with responsibility for Gaeltacht and Irish language affairs.  We propose an additional allocation of annual funding dedicated to the continued implementation of the Irish language strategy and further current expenditure for projects under &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  We are also committed to supporting the office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, protecting its independence, and introducing legislation to strengthen the Official Languages Act and make language legislation more effective.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we must ensure that Irish remains at the heart of our junior certificate and leaving certificate curriculum.  In addition, we are also committed to examining the possibility of introducing a second Irish language option for the leaving certificate and junior certificate to cater specifically for the needs of native Irish speakers and other fluent speakers, and to ensure that Gaeltacht schools have the freedom and resources to teach Irish to the native speaker in a manner that is appropriate and effective.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il strongly supports the implementation of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, which we brought forward while in government.  We also put in place the Official Languages Act, which gave a statutory basis for the first time to the rights in respect of the language enshrined in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  According to the 2011 census, 41% of the population can speak Irish, which includes 83,526 people who reside in my own county of Kildare.  It is interesting to note that 1.8% of the population speaks Irish on a daily basis outside the education system.</p><p>That accounts for 1,185 people in County Kildare.  The statistics also show that 18.7% of the population speak Irish daily, weekly or less regularly.  They should be supported and promoted and more opportunities should be given to them.  We should remember the words: "T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam."  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh anam agus teanga sa Rialtas sa todhcha&iacute;.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an Aire sinsearach ann chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; strait&eacute;is an 20 bliain a chur i bhfeidhm agus chun ceannaireacht a l&eacute;iri&uacute; ag bord an Rialtais.

Cabhr&oacute;dh s&eacute; go m&oacute;r le scoileanna beaga tuaithe Gaeltachta.

Deputy Brendan Griffin offered a good suggestion that towns in Gaeltacht areas twin with towns outside them.  That is certainly a good idea that is worth progressing.</p>  <p>  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan had some interesting things to say about the school in Ballincollig.  Perhaps he might pass on the details to me and I will be happy to pass them on to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.</p>  <p>  I want to remind some Opposition Deputies of the reason funding for the Gaeltacht was cut.  It was due to the economic crisis in which the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government landed the country.  Also, funding was not cut only in the Gaeltacht; it was cut across the budgets of all Departments.</p>  <p>  I want to set the record straight.  It was during the term of the previous Government that the derogation for the Irish language in the European Union was granted.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam ach ba mhaith liom l&eacute;argas a thabhairt ar chuid de na beartais a bheidh i gceist ag an Rialtas seo chun tac&uacute; le caomhn&uacute; na teanga.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the programme for a partnership Government recognises that the Irish language is of crucial importance to our heritage and culture and includes a number of specific comments to preserve and support the language.  By systematically implementing the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, the new Government will help increase the number of people using Irish in their daily lives and ensure Irish becomes a more visible language in today's society both as a spoken language and in areas such as signage and literature.</p> <p> Much debate has centred around the lack of funding.  Deputies will be pleased to know the programme for Government also contains a focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which will share a &euro;300 million jobs fund with Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p> The Government also wants to encourage the attendance by children in Irish preschools, na&iacute;onra&iacute;, in Gaeltacht areas.  We recognise the importance of the status of Irish as a full working language of the European Union institutions and work towards ending the derogation.  The derogation has been lifted and a recruitment process will begin shortly.  We plan to increase investment in the Irish language as the public finances allow.</p> <p> Like other Deputies, I studied Irish and sat exams in school but, like so many people who learned Irish in school, my competency in the language has faded over the years because I did not have cause to use it.  I have made efforts to improve my Irish during the past two years and I plan to redouble these efforts in the years ahead.  I acknowledge the huge amount of work done by my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, his role as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht.  He had full delegated responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language during his term of office and he confounded his critics by throwing himself wholeheartedly into the language.  He is a fantastic example of how it is possible to reconnect with the language.  His experience will have encouraged others to be brave enough to speak the c&uacute;pla focal again.  People who lecture others about not having fluent Irish and not being able to speak the language put people off speaking Irish and, sometimes, do more damage to the language.  I acknowledge the passion for the language held by so many Members of the House.</p> <p> Earlier, Deputy Catherine Murphy said there was much more interest in our culture in the United States then there was here.  I refute this comment.  There has been a major revival and interest in our culture, heritage and history, which was highlighted and reflected in the 2016 commemorations.  A major revival in and hunger for our culture has been at the heart of the commemorations.  We need only look at the schools flag programme, Proclamation day and how our young people reconnected their flag in their history.  I acknowledge the co-operation of many organisations in the commemoration.  I particularly thank the teachers of Ireland who helped our young people connect with our heritage and culture.</p> <p> We must all work together in the best interests of the language and explore new ways to support and expand the use of Irish so it permeates through our lives and all parts of our daily activities.  Even if we use only a few words of Irish, we should think about Irish, and we must encourage more of that.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas ar&iacute;s leis na Teachta&iacute; uile a labhair ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</p></speech>

The Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 updates the law on adoption in a progressive manner in Ireland.  We face a daunting task as legislators in this regard.  We are trying to provide a legislative framework that will ensure the best outcomes and fairness for all children adopted in Ireland.  The vast majority of children who are adopted in Ireland come from abroad.</p>  <p>  As Deputies, we have to be reminded of our responsibilities to legislate correctly for this most vulnerable group in society, our children.  A child without a parent who can care for him or her is especially in need of care and love.  Such children need legislation and an Adoption Authority that responds to their needs and is in step with a society that is constantly changing.  Youth holds the promise of the future.  With all the energy and challenges of childhood and adolescence, it is a vital time that leaves its mark on us all.  Children who are to be adopted in Ireland require adoptive parents who will love them and who can care for them.  Where they are of an age where they can express themselves, the requirement that their views be considered and that all decisions be made in their best interests is of paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  As a family lawyer, I have seen great changes in the law on adoption and welcome the Bill as a responsible and progressive updating of adoption law in Ireland, as required by the will of the people who passed the children's rights referendum in 2012 and the marriage equality referendum in 2015.  It was in the reforming era of the 1960s that the legal concept of the best interests of the child became the cornerstone of family law in Ireland with the passing of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This Act has been significantly amended by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which recognised that children had a right to be heard when of an appropriate age.  The Act also accepted that children are raised in all sorts of circumstances, primarily by married parents but also by relations, step-parents, civil partners and parents who are straight and gay.  In a similar vein, this Bill updates the law on adoption to give children of an appropriate age, a voice in the proceedings and to respond to ever-changing more complex family situations.</p>  <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified in 1992, acknowledges the family as the fundamental unit of society.  It stresses the role of parents as primary care givers with responsibility for the upbringing of their children and obliges governments to support parents in fulfilling their roles.  In addition, the convention provided that children's views must be considered in all matters affecting them.</p>  <p>  Ireland has signed up to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The Adoption Act 2010 strengthened the regulatory framework governing adoption to ensure the best interests of children are protected in the adoption process.  Ireland permits international adoptions only with countries which have signed the Hague convention on intercountry adoption or with whom Ireland has a bilateral adoption agreement.  This protects the best interests of the children involved.</p>  <p>  The 31st amendment of the Constitution on the rights of children obligates this House to legislate to allow a child the opportunity to be adopted where the parents have met a high threshold of failure towards the child, where it is in the best interests of the child and where all other options have been explored and failed.  I am very relieved that section 23 of the Bill provides a robust provision whereby, after three years, a child can be adopted where the parents have failed in their duty towards the child to such an extent that the safety or welfare of the child is likely to be prejudicially affected, where there is no reasonable prospect that the parents will be able to care for the child and where this failure constitutes abandonment.</p>  <p>  The proposed Bill is strict, as it should be, in considering what limited circumstances permit a child to be adopted when abandoned and where the parent cannot provide care.  This is in step with our policy, which is framed at of doing everything that is reasonable and in the best interests of the child, to keep a child with his or her parents.  However, I have seen some clear cases in which children in care have been abandoned and where the parents do not have a capacity to parent.  Many of these children remain in care all their lives when adoption should also be an option.  This Bill makes it increasingly possible that such children could be adopted either by relatives or foster parents.</p>  <p>  For children in care who have been abandoned and where there is no parental capacity to parent, adoption would be a more secure and emotionally rewarding experience than remaining in foster care all their lives.  For these children, adoption should be a real alternative.  I believe passionately that these options need to be examined by foster parents who wish to adopt.</p><p>Article 42A of the Constitution commits the Oireachtas to introduce legislation that allows parents, either married or unmarried, to voluntarily place their child for adoption and to consent to the adoption of their child.  The Bill also provides that where the child is of an appropriate age that their own particular views are considered and taken into account.  <br/><br/>The Bill will also allow civil partners and cohabiting couples to adopt.  It contains a new provision for cohabiting couples who have been cohabiting for a continuous period of three years to jointly adopt.  Under section 18, the Bill further allows a step-parent who has a home with the child's parent for a continuous period of two years or, in exceptional circumstances, less than two years to adopt the child of their partner.  The Bill allows for a change to step-parent adoption by removing the removing the requirement for the other parent to adopt their own child, making this option more feasible and more realistic.  <br/><br/>The Bill will allow civil partners to adopt.  Married couples, which include same-sex couples, can adopt.  I welcome the support of Barnardos and its guardian <i>ad litem </i>service for this Bill.  Those guardians <i>ad litem</i>, who represent the voice and best wishes of the child in child care proceedings, have years of experience dealing with children in care.  Barnardos described this Bill as another crucial piece of legislation prioritising children, and I welcome that.  I also welcome the support of Children's Right Alliance for it.<br/><br/>Our current law prohibits married parents from placing a child for adoption and this has left many children in long-term foster care who could have been adopted but whose parents were married.  The Bill removes that outdated provision.  It provides for adoption where the parents, married or unmarried, have abandoned the child and have failed for a continuous period for three years in their duty to that child.<br/><br/>It is correct to broaden eligibility for adoption which the Bill proposes.  Our adoption law would then be updated to best international practice regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption.  The Bill updates the law on adoption, taking into consideration the already expressed wishes of the Irish people in two referenda and that in itself is a unique situation where the Parliament is responding to an issue where every citizen was given a voice.  As a practitioner of family law, a mother and a citizen, I very much welcome the Bill.</p></speech>

It is the first legislation to be brought before the House in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, which is fitting.  One of the first jobs done in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il was to provide for the putting of the referendum of children's rights before the people.  There were a number of delays that were beyond people's control and legal challenges to the outcome of that referendum, which delayed this legislation coming to the House.  I welcome its introduction to the House on behalf of those people who do not have voice in here, those people who will be impacted most by it.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister on her appointment to this important portfolio of children and youth affairs.  It was interesting and welcome that the previous Government in its wisdom, led by the Taoiseach, promoted this portfolio to a senior Department and to a senior ministry.  That development was long overdue.  Any society can be judged by how we care for people such as children.  It was a sad reflection that it took until that day for that to happen.  Perhaps we were blinded by some of the silliness of the economics in the Celtic tiger years but, thankfully, common sense has prevailed and this responsibility has been elevated to a senior ministry.  I am delighted for the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and congratulate her on her appointment.  I wish her every good will in this very important endeavour for the years ahead.  It is a top priority.  I always promote option politics where we as Members of a House or members of the party identify our top priority.  The care of children and how we deal with them and face the challenges and issues presenting is the top priority for this society at this time, and this being the first legislation before the new D&aacute;il is very telling in that regard.</p>  <p>  I have been asked, on occasion, what was my proudest achievement during the past five years of the previous D&aacute;il and without missing a heartbeat I can state, without fear or favour, that my single greatest and proudest achievement was the role I got to play in the passing of the referendum on children's rights and in convincing people to support it.  I do not believe there was a radio station in the country on which that I did not end up debating this matter.  It was a personal privilege and honour to be in a position to do that and to get the referendum result over the line.  I remember some critics, people like Kathy Sinnott and John Waters, trying to put across the image that the referendum would result in the big bad State prowling around in the dead of night taking children from the family home and putting them into an awful place, that of State care, and conjuring up frightening images of the State care that they alleged could do so much damage to these children.  Thankfully, today, when we talk about children in the care of the State we are speaking, for the most part, about children who are living with ordinary families throughout the country who have decided, for whatever reason, to share their home with children who cannot be in their own home.  I happen to be one of those fortunate and privileged people who get to share my family home with children who, for whatever reason, cannot live in their own home or stay with their own birth mother or father.  That is an honour in itself.  It is also an incredible education.  One of the bigger challenges during the referendum campaign was to explain to people that State care means children in the care of ordinary families who are delighted and honoured to share their home with children who are not so fortunate as to be born in their own home.  </p>  <p>  I recall a well known and high profile television presenter who said that this referendum would only impact on a tiny number of children and asking what was the importance of it.  That completely missed the point because those 5,000 or 6,000 children in this State who cannot live in their own homes are the most special, the most vulnerable and the most important children in the State.  There is an obligation, an onus and moral responsibility on all of us to rise to that challenge and ensure we do everything for those people who do not have the good fortune the vast majority have, which is to be cared for and loved in our own home.</p>  <p>  Some 73 years ago Abraham Maslow identified a hierarchy of needs in his paper entitled, A Theory of Human Motivation.  He identified the top need as the physiological need for food and water, the second need as one's  personal safety and to be in an environment where one is  safe and secure and the third need, which is particularly relevant in childhood, as being the need to belong, or as he called it "belongingness".  It is a powerful driver in all of us and we probably do not take enough time to stop and think about it because we all have the good fortune of being reared in our own families and having that sense of identity, having our surname which gives us a connection to it and which, as we grow, extends beyond our family to our community and the clubs to which we belong.  It is a powerful driver for children to have such an identity and that sense of belonging.</p>  <p>  Children who come into the care of the State and cannot be with their own birth mother and father, for whatever reasons, end up dealing with that challenge of the need and desire to belong.  Prior to the passing of the referendum the reality was that those 5,000 or 6,000 children who were in the care of the State, in foster care living with foster families, could not have been adopted by those families until they reached the age of 18 because it had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that up until the age of 18 they had been abandoned by their own parents.  The only real possibility of that was letting them arrive at the age of 18.  For the first 18 years of their lives they were denied a sense of belonging, which we all take for granted, being part of a family unit and sharing in the love, joy, challenges and drama that goes with being part and parcel of one's siblings and family.  It was vital for those children that this referendum got over the line.  Children in the care of the State, many of whom have come to families from maternity wards, are reared and grow up with the family but they cannot be fully part of that family in that they cannot share the family surname.  When they go to school they have a different surname from their siblings but they want to be part of the family and to have that identity but the State denied them that.  Therefore, it was crucial that we got the referendum over the line.</p><p>We are now discussing the legislative implications of the referendum and, finally, giving effect to it so that children can be adopted by these families and achieve the sense of belonging they seek to satisfy that all-powerful third sense identified by Maslow 73 years ago.</p> <p> I listened with interest to much of the debate yesterday.  Many of the specifics of the Bill have been well addressed in the Chamber and I do not intend to go through it piece by piece or repeat many of the points made.  I noted the tone of the debate yesterday and the caring contributions from all sides of the House.  There was a unity of purpose there and everybody acknowledged that this was a good news story and a positive development for our society.  We are all as one in seeing that develop and grow.  Certain other issues were referred to such as the challenges for tracing, which the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, mentioned yesterday.  She said she would like to see an amendment on that added to the Bill, which is a very worthy proposal.  We should give tracing much more consideration.  It is difficult to balance the rights of the parent who wants to remain anonymous, give up a child and have no more to do with him or her and the rights of the child to know who he or she is.  It goes back to that driving sense, which is the third strongest, of belonging, identity and knowing who one is.  That is a challenge the Minister is going to lead and I look forward to assisting and playing my part in that in any way I can.</p> <p> I always preach solution-led politics.  We can all identify the problems and criticise and complain but coming up with solutions is the really challenging bit.  The onus is on all of us in that regard.  If we are to identify a new type of politics in the House, I promote that politics where we all put our heads together.  None of us on any side of the House has a monopoly on wisdom but we all have a story to tell, an experience to share and knowledge to bring to the topic.  Society has a need - we have to lead on it and drive the change - to look at the reasons children are coming into the care of the State.  There has been an increase of almost 25% in the number of children who have come into the care of the State since 2007.  The figures are probably close to 7,000 at this stage.  It may not be a bad thing that the numbers are increasing.  There is a variety of reasons the numbers are increasing and not all of them are negative.  There are issues and challenges there to do with poverty, deprivation, education, health and well-being as well as a variety of cultural and other challenges in this day and age.  People are realising they do not have the wherewithal to raise the children they have brought into the world.  While they might have the physical capacity to do it, they do not have the wherewithal afterwards.  As parents, we all understand the challenge involved in rearing children and the responsibility that goes with it.  We must have a more sincere debate on those reasons.  There is a great deal more awareness today.  To be fair to school authorities, communities, relations and family members, a great deal of what went on in homes before was hidden behind closed doors and people did not talk about it.  People are now more willing to embrace the challenges and recognise where people are failing as parents and being more proactive about getting involved.  That may be one of the reasons for the increase in numbers of children in care.</p> <p> I am conscious of the time available.  One other issue I want to debate and flag with the Minister today involves post-adoption services.  While we very much welcome the ability of parents to adopt and foster children and while the Bill addresses longing and belonging, it does not address a lot of other issues.  A big problem for people who have been able to adopt children has been the lack of post-adoption services in Ireland, in particular outside the greater Dublin area.  If one lives in the greater Dublin area, one has access to a range of services through the wonderful work Barnardos does.  If one lives outside the greater Dublin area, however, there really are no services.  If one looks at England, one sees Family Futures, a powerful organisation doing wonderful work dealing with children who experienced early trauma in their lives.  As those children hit their adolescent and teen years, it becomes very difficult to deal with the challenges that arise.  Adoptive and foster parents and those of all hues need to get support for themselves and, more importantly, the children.  The range of post-adoption supports is really lacking here however.  Those intervention services constitute one of the most pressing issues which requires to be addressed at this point in time.  We all know the argument about investing today and reaping tomorrow.  Directing our focus, energy and minds towards that and addressing those issues today can lead to savings, not only economic, but of heartbreak, and benefits in terms of quality of life and all that goes with it, including for society.  It is not easy to wake up one day and realise that one is not in one's own home and that the person one thought was one's Dad for however long is not one's Dad and that one's Mum is not one's Mum.  There are also issues that come up from one's childhood and trauma.  It is an area I look forward to discussing further with the Minister.  I again wish her well in her term of office.</p></speech>

I begin by congratulating the Minister on her appointment.  I am not sure if she is aware that she is a constituency neighbour of mine as the steps of Killinarden run up to the hills of Kilteel as Kildare North and Dublin South-West border each other.  As such, I extend my best wishes to her on her appointment and wish her continued success in the role.</p><p>In terms of the matter before us, Fianna F&aacute;il as an opposition party will freely oppose the Government on issues when merited but equally, as a constructive party and mindful of the minority Government framework which can only work when all sides play their part, agree on areas of common ground.  Accordingly, we will be constructive and supportive of issues and legislation arising when we feel it is in interest of the common good to do so.  Thankfully, family law and the rights and well-being of children are issues which cross party political lines and in which all of us in this House have a common purpose, wishing to see progress for the greater public good.</p><p>The subject matter of the Bill is a matter of sensitivity to many people, not least those who have been involved in adoptions previously or currently but also the many children who have been denied that possibility.  Some of them currently languish in a legal half life in foster care, institutions or other arrangements in which they enjoy no legitimate expectation of being adopted in the foreseeable future.  It seems hard to believe with the welcome focus in recent years on the area that adoption in this country was at one time barely subject to any regulation.  The enactment of the Adoption Act 1952 was the first measure to put in place a legal framework for adoptions in Ireland.  Prior to that adoption was on a custom and practice basis, privately arranged and subject, I am sure, to many anomalies.  More recently, Fianna F&aacute;il when last in office put in place the Adoption Act 2010 and initiated the process leading to the children's referendum in 2012.  I remember that referendum well because I campaigned in it.  Many of the provisions being enacted in the Bill stem from that referendum, which was passed by the Irish people, and indeed are mandated by it.  All parties in the House supported the referendum and a positive campaign ensued.  The wording of the constitutional amendment was formulated following an extensive and constructive all-party consultation leading to the design of the new Article 42A.</p><p>This being a complex and technical area it has taken a little time to bring provisions before the House.  While many of the amendments in the Bill are technical and miscellaneous in their nature, there are some important provisions which will have a major impact on the fabric of many lives.  My experience in campaigning for the referendum, as well as from many meetings and interactions as a public representative, makes me aware that there are aspects of this that people fear.  People fear constitutional change at the best of times but as family law is a sensitive area, there are some schools of thought, misperception and concerns about what may arise.  Family law is always a sensitive matter and must be dealt with accordingly.  In some quarters, there is a concern that a move to strengthen rights of a child may in some way diminish rights of the parent or the family.  This does not have to be so and, in fact, the correct balance has been struck in Irish law to date.</p><p>I want to address two provisions of the Bill in some detail.  These are section 12 which revises section 23 of the principal Act and section 23, which updates section 54 of the principal Act.  These sections deal principally with the adoption of a child born within the marital family and the difficult issue of involuntary adoption where the parents have not consented, typically on foot of abandonment or a failure of care within the family, be it marital or otherwise.  There is a presumption in law that the child's best interests are served within its natural family but the presumption is rebuttable.  The presumption has been recognised both by the Supreme Court and by the European Court of Human Rights.  In 1994 in Keegan <i>v</i>. Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights noted that the family unit need not be confined to the marital relationship to enjoy protection but that a <i>de facto</i>family existed and enjoyed protection as well as rights, regardless of its marital status.</p><p>As an aside, the facts of that case were traumatic.  It involved a father who saw his child being sent for adoption by the mother of the child and who was at the time powerless in law to do anything about it.  The couple had met in England and had been residing there, but the mother later moved back to Ireland where she gave her child up for adoption.  The father followed her here but was unable to intervene, not having a right to be heard on the matter.  While the law has advanced and such a scenario would not recur, as the father's rights are now recognised, there is still much work to be done regarding father's rights.  I hope that the D&aacute;il can consider this matter on other occasions.<br/><br/>A landmark Supreme Court ruling in adoption law is what is known as the Baby Ann case, or N &amp;amp; anor <i>v.</i>Health Service Executive &amp;amp; ors, in 2006.  The facts of this case were traumatic for the parties involved.  A young couple met at university, had a child together, gave the child up for adoption and within 18 months became regretful of that decision and sought to reverse it.  They had married in the meantime, meaning that their marital family enjoyed constitutional protection at the time.  A difficult train of events followed.  Some of the judgments in the case are worth quoting, in particular that of Mr. Justice Hardiman, who is no longer with us.  As it was a lengthy judgment, I will read a short extract.  He summarised succinctly the balance that the Constitution and Irish law had attempted to strike between the rights of the family, the rights of the child and the best interests of all.  He stated:</p><blockquote>There are certain misapprehensions on which repeated and unchallenged public airings have conferred undeserved currency.  One of these relates to the position of children in the Constitution.  It would be quite untrue to say that the Constitution puts the rights of parents first and those of children second.  It fully acknowledges the &quot;natural and imprescriptible rights&quot; and the human dignity, of children, but equally recognises the inescapable fact that a young child cannot exercise his or her own rights.  The Constitution does not prefer parents to children.  The preference the Constitution gives is this: it prefers parents to third parties, official or private, priest or social worker, as the enablers and guardians of the child's rights.  This preference has its limitations: parents cannot, for example, ignore the responsibility of educating their child.  More fundamentally, the Constitution provides for the wholly exceptional situation where, for physical or moral reasons, parents fail in their duty towards their child.  Then, indeed, the State must intervene and endeavour to supply the place of the parents, always with due regard to the rights of the child.</blockquote><p>It is an excellent judgment that not only applies to the facts of that case, but also to the locus of family law and the constitutional position.  It was a pre-referendum judgment, but it still applies, perhaps even more so.<br/><br/>It is against this context that section 12 of the Bill must be set and any concern raised about the marital family and the adoptions from within that are enabled in the Bill must be considered.  These protections continue, but in parallel the Bill addresses the limbo in which children may linger for years with no hope or expectation of being adopted or moved to a situation in which care, love and affection can be put upon them.  That the Bill advances and begins to enable this aspect is to be welcomed.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy that, in the Supreme Court's decision, Mrs. Justice McGuinness, who was perhaps less of Mr. Justice Hardiman's view, stated that, even were she minded not to reach the decision of her colleagues, she would have had no option but to do so because it was impossible at the time, even if she felt it was the right thing to do or there was a need to do so, to place the child up for adoption, being the child of marital parents.  As such, it is recognised that there are scenarios in which the natural family is not the safe, correct or appropriate environment for the child to remain within.  In those circumstances, the State must intervene to prevent the limbo of children remaining in institutions for many years and give them better lives, obstacles that adoption enables them to tackle.<br/><br/>The constitutional amendment requires the Legislature to revisit and approve this scenario and that a &quot;failure in duty must be provided for in law&quot;.  Section 23 inserts a new test into the legislation that will need to be robust, multifaceted and likely more amenable to judicial exercise.  The Children's Rights Alliance has stated that the current &quot;threshold of complete and permanent parental failure is set so high that in practice it is unachievable&quot;.  This creates a situation in which children lie in limbo for many years because judges simply refuse to decide that the threshold has been met.  We cannot legislate for judicial discretion.  We as legislators can enable legislation, but we cannot second-guess the Judiciary.  The new test that replaces the threshold is more robust and multi-stranded and should lend weight to better decision making.<br/><br/>The Bill meets the parameters, addresses the concerns raised and progresses the situation.  An important point that has received less commentary is that a child over the age of seven years can now be adopted.  There are many children between the ages of seven and 18 years who require intervention.  The provision enabling such adoptions is much needed and welcome.<br/><br/>The Bill contains a number of other miscellaneous, but important, provisions, but I do not propose to discuss those now, as I wanted to focus on the ones that I raised.  I commend the Bill and welcome its progress.  I thank the Minister for her observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800038#MM00200"><p>I join others in congratulating the Minister on her appointment.  I have a great interest in the work of her Department, in particular relating to child care, and I look forward to working with her constructively on the resources needed by early childhood years service providers and to seeing their agenda and that of parents progressed during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.</p><p>I listened to the Minister's remarks on the Bill yesterday.  She referred to how basic human rights issues went to the core of who she was as a person.  She wore her heart on her sleeve yesterday, for which she is to be admired.  I also listened to Deputy Joan Burton's remarks on this matter, in particular about the failure of the Bill to address problems with adoption information and tracing.</p><p>I wish to quote some lines:</p><blockquote>It was great to see this year, Ireland celebrating its past with her people's search for connection to it, stronger than ever.  Indeed, the month of March 2016 saw the online release of thousands of Irish Catholic Parish records for public access and genealogy websites gifting a month's free access to users.  The interest in identity remains a booming business yet the significance of it can be felt very deeply within people's lives.</blockquote><p>These lines came from a lady in London who wrote to me on behalf of her aunt who is now in her 80s and comes from Castlepollard in my constituency of Meath West.  She was born at the Castlepollard mother and baby home in the 1930s and was separated from her mother, whom she never saw again, at birth.  Following a lifetime of complicit silence, she asked her niece six months ago to find something out about her biological family.  She made a request for information and tracing via Tusla, but it is inundated with requests and the task of processing retrospective and current cases is a major undertaking for its staff.  The lady and her aunt have received minimal information to date.  As the lady said, time is against them after eight decades.  They need action.</p><p>With regard to the wider aspects of the Bill, it brings greater clarity to adoption legislation and removes a number of outdated legal anomalies, in particular that of adoptions by step-parents.  It facilitates married parents in placing their children up for adoption on a voluntary basis where both parents consent to the making of the adoption order.  I agree with the Minister's assertion that the legislation provides for significant improvements in the rights of children and that she is focused on putting the best interests of the child at the centre of any discussion regarding adoption.</p><p>In that regard, I will touch on a matter that our spokesperson, Deputy Robert Troy, raised yesterday and that can be emotive for people, namely, the provision that gives greater legislative clarity to adoption proceedings in the case of parental failure.  Parental failure happens.  It is an unpleasant fact, one that people often do not like to admit or discuss.  Some important sections of our society do not even acknowledge that it exists.  The mantra that a child is always best served by being with his or her biological parents is not accurate.  I have seen scenarios in which nothing could have been further from the truth.  The provision in the amended section allowing the High Court to authorise the adoption authorities to make an adoption order on behalf of applicants, for example, foster parents or relatives, if the court is satisfied that such an authorisation is in the best interests of the child, and that the child's parents have failed in their duty towards him or her, is a positive one.  It provides a welcome clarity and puts the rights of the child to the fore, not the defence of parents whose main act was one of love making rather than of providing the love, care and support needed for a happy and stable childhood.</p><p>In tandem, there is a real need to consider the resources for those who provide support systems for children in care and support for children&rsquo;s services generally.  Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s words yesterday, I hope and have a great sense that she will champion that cause and demand and seek more resources for children.</p> <p> The most substantive provision in the Bill is obviously to give legislative effect to the new article, Article 42A, on the rights of the child.  That provision is to be made in law to enable the views of children who are the subject of child care, custody or adoption proceedings to be ascertained.  Most important, that the court is to give them due weight is very welcome.  </p> <p> I commend the Bill for addressing so many legal anomalies.  It is positive to see the rights of children being progressed in this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800039#NN00200"><p>I congratulate Deputy Katherine Zappone on her appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I listened with great interest to her opening remarks and welcome the opportunity to speak to the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016.  The Bill is extremely complex and sensitive but for many adoptive parents and children who are adopted, it provides clarity on their legal rights.</p><p>Every one of us has heard stories about children being taken from their birth mothers without consent.  This sad practice has been highlighted in many documentaries and films during the years.  I am thankful that this practice has ceased, but, sadly, there are still many adults, some of whom I know from my community, who have never been able to reunite with their birth mothers.  In the long run we should do as much as we can to help them.</p><p>The reaction to the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been positive.  Following its publication, two major children&rsquo;s charities - Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance - issued press releases welcoming it.  Barnardos described it as &quot;another crucial piece of legislation prioritising children&quot;.  We all agree with this.  The Bill was long awaited, yet it is now before us and I hope it will be passed soon.  Both charities particularly welcomed the amendment on married parents and adoption.  Under current law, married parents are prohibited from placing a child for adoption.  This has created obstacles for many children whose parents are married but who are living in long-term foster or institutional care.  The Bill removes this ban.  It will ensure a child&rsquo;s best wishes are central to each and every adoption case.  That is important because we sometimes forget children do have a voice.  The Bill is very clear in establishing that they will have a voice. </p><p>With the introduction of the Bill, a parent will continue to be the parent and the step-parent will be an adoptive parent.  This will remove the requirement for parents to adopt their own child.  This is a most welcome amendment addressing a bizarre set of circumstances that has been allowed to continue.</p><p><b></b>The Bill will allow civil partners and cohabitees the opportunity to adopt if they so wish.  This is one aspect of the Bill that I most welcome.  I really believe it is a step in the right direction.  In my humble opinion, when one can give a child love, care and protection, one should be able to do so if one is a cohabitee or civil partner.</p><p>Another principal provision in the Bill includes allowing for a change of criteria under which the High Court can make an adoption order without parental consent in the case of parental failure.  Many have spoken about parents who are just not able to rear their children.  It is most essential that the provision in this regard be included in the Bill.  It will allow us to act where parents are not able to really look after their children and where there is parental failure.</p><p>A family support model underpins the child protection and welfare system favoured in Ireland.  A family, by definition, should meet a child&rsquo;s emotional, intellectual, social, cultural and material needs.  Where families, for whatever reason, cannot meet these needs, they are encouraged to seek help from the many support services available.  Many such services are doing a wonderful job in communities and with families throughout the country.  I commend them for the work they do.</p><p>Early interventions and long-term preventive action are recommended as the best ways to promote children&rsquo;s welfare and protection.  However, the interests and well-being of the child are of most importance.  I spent a lot of time working with young children in voluntary organisations, youth clubs and community groups and was always aware when a child was in difficulty, or from a background in which the parents just might not have been able to manage.  I was always inspired by the people who came to their assistance, be they from a voluntary or State agency.  They still continue to do a great job in this regard.</p><p>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children &amp;amp; Young People is the principal policy document for shaping the formation and delivery of State services for children across Departments.  There are a number of goals identified in the framework, some of which are relevant to the Adoption (Amendment) Bill.  First, the framework aims to assist and support parents in raising their families, fulfilling their role as primary carers, helping to achieve the best possible outcomes for their children and overcoming challenges or difficulties they may encounter.  It makes specific reference to the role of the State in supporting children and young people in care.</p><p>Another goal is to listen to and involve children.  The document recognises the importance of children.  It gives due weight to their opinions and concerns.  In the past, this was not the case.  Many a time when children did speak out, whether in school or an institution, we did not listen.  This is an opportunity to do so.</p><p>What we now need to do is to enact the Bill as soon as possible to give birth parents, adoptive parents and especially children a real opportunity to get on with their lives, such that children can continue to live in a family environment where there is love and care and emotional help when needed.  I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill which I hope we will be able to enact as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Hers is an important role that has been well underlined in society in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The shortcomings in legislation to protect children have been blatantly obvious for many years.  Therefore, this is crucial legislation.  It follows in the wake of the amendment to the Constitution that provided for it.  It is something on which the Minister can put her stamp in the years ahead.  She has an opportunity, in particular, to set down the protection children need and recognise their position in society.  She also has an opportunity to recognise the need to ensure that in years to come those who look back will be able to say legislation was put in place and that a Minister took control in continuation of the work carried out by her predecessor.  The legislation will be of tremendous benefit to society.</p>  <p>  One can only but be impressed by the comments of my colleagues to which I listened today and last evening.  We must put ourselves in the position of a child to fully appreciate and recognise the extent to which a child is governed by events around him or her and over which he or she has little or no control.  It is entirely appropriate that the State be in a position to guarantee the rights of the child.</p>  <p>  Like my colleague, we were all subject to a certain amount of criticism and suspicion in the run-up to the referendum, at which time it was inferred that the intention was to extract children from their natural parents and the family home against the will of the parents and so on.  Of course, that was not the intention of the referendum, nor is it the intention of the legislation.  If one studies the world in which children reside, one notes that they are governed by what happens around them, what they see around them and what they see as affecting them in their own little way.  Their lives are shaped by their formative years and the way they are treated, in addition to their feeling of being part of, cared for and loved in a family unit and of belonging to it.  In other words, they require security and rely on those around them.</p><p>However, in some cases, such security is not available to them.<br/><br/>I would always be reluctant to remove a child from its natural parents, particularly its mother, because separation causes serious trauma to both mother and child.  Deputies will have watched various television programmes featuring cases involving children who traced their birth parents or <i>vice versa </i>after many years of separation.  In many cases, the mother and child have spent years wondering how the other has traversed through life and whether he or she has been successful.  We must recognise that the bond between mother and child persists throughout life by ensuring the legislation pays due regard to this sensitive parental bond, or perhaps I should say &quot;maternal bond&quot;.  <br/><br/>We have all dealt with difficult cases involving families.  Some involve a tug of love over a child and children will become vulnerable as a result of marital breakdown.  Acrimonious separation cases in the courts may result in children becoming the subject matter of major legal battles.  In the first instance, I feel sorry for the children affected, as we all should, but I also feel sorry for the parents who may or may not feel genuine sorrow.  The problem may have escalated to such an extent that neither parent is willing to give way to the other.  In such cases, concerns about the child or the life he or she will lead following the separation become secondary to the battle taking place in the courts, with various experts called to give their opinion. <br/><br/>In the final analysis, we must come down to the level of the child and ask what he or she wants.  The Bill makes provision to do precisely that, which is good.  In some circumstances, it may be difficult to identify precisely what the child wants.  For example, in a tug of love case, the child may be influenced by one or other party to such an extent that he or she is confused and cannot reach a decision.  We must be mindful of this.<br/><br/>As previous speakers noted, addiction can result in neglect, whether wilful or as a result of an inability to cope, leading to children becoming vulnerable.  Some observers will argue that children are better off in their natural environment with their parents.  On the other hand, we must ask whether it is in the best interests of a child to remain in such an environment.  To what extent will a child be psychologically damaged by being allowed or forced to remain in a setting in which it believes it is not wanted or loved and does not feel a sense of belonging?  It is vital for small children that they have a sense that they are secure, safe and belong.  Children do not know the ways of the world and are in a learning curve.  What they see happening around them informs their later lives and they adopt the attitudes that are displayed towards them in their formative years.  We must take account of all the nuances in a child's life in these sensitive and important years.  Irrespective of the reasons a child finds itself subjected to neglect, abuse or deprivation - the circumstances are beyond the child's control and may be the result of a parent's addiction problems or because they are poor and find themselves unable to cope by virtue of their poverty - society has a responsibility to act.  However, the State must intervene in a positive and supportive manner, in the first instance taking care to ensure it does not interfere unnecessarily or in a provocative or challenging manner.  It must intervene in a supportive manner that is in the interests of the child and takes account of the particular circumstances of the case.  <br/><br/>All Deputies will have encountered cases involving a poor, unfortunate child who is in a difficult position which may worsen.  In the past 30 years, we have had ample evidence of cases involving deliberate and sustained abuse of children with no action taken to address the matter.  While we are quick to point out that the perpetrators were horrible people, which is true, we must also recognise that society at the time was not as caring as it should have been.  I hope that when people look back on this period, they will conclude that society was caring, assumed responsibility and intervened in a supportive manner that reflected the interests of vulnerable children and did so with a view to ensuring the children concerned were able to grow up in a less challenging environment to make a normal contribution to society.  If we fail to adopt this approach, the circumstances I have described will be revisited on society and we will have further recriminations as people ask why such cases were permitted to take place.  Let us not forget the many things that happened here in the not too distant past over many years.  We now ask why and how they happened but the simple reason was that no one did anything about them.  Many people were aware of various abuses and there were plenty of avenues available to challenge and address them but people did not act.<br/><br/>How does an adolescent who has experienced abuse feel?  In countless instances of abuse, deprivation and hostility, it has been suggested the child was at fault.  This may be an astonishing conclusion to reach but it is the way society operated at the time.  We still have a tendency to look away and pretend that certain things are not happening, society has evolved and this type of abuse no longer occurs.  That is a dangerous position to be in. <br/><br/>Last night, in a moving speech, Deputy Joan Burton referred to the rights of adopted persons to know about their past and to be able to relate to their natural parents and inquire into and obtain information on the circumstances surrounding how they came to be adopted.  In a modern, transparent society, we must make provision to vindicate these rights.  I am aware that separate legislation has been introduced to address this issue.  I hope it can be implemented with this legislation in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p> I believe this legislation is hugely important and that it will make a major contribution towards stabilising society in the future.  It will give us an opportunity to recognise the children of the nation, as referred to in the Constitution.  We have a responsibility towards them and must accept and deal with that responsibility in their best interests.</p> <p> I do not have time nor is it appropriate to go through the various sections of the Bill now, but I hope it satisfactorily addresses the issues that have been prominent in recent years and that the protection it proposes to give children will be manifest in time to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800041#PP00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, on her appointment and wish her well in the task that lies ahead.</p>  <p>  The Bill deals with the sensitive and difficult issues of adoption proceedings, adoption orders and adoption eligibility, but we all agree that the paramount concern must be the best interests of the child.  Every child has an inalienable and now, constitutionally, enshrined right to be assured his or her best interests will always be the fundamental and sole concern in adoption cases.  Furthermore, children's own wishes, desires and views on their best interest should be valued and, as far as possible, have a significant bearing on any court decision made.</p>  <p>  One of the main tenets of the Constitution is that we must cherish children.  Few matters can be of such importance to a child's welfare and well-being as those of custody, guardianship and adoption.  It is a sign of how much our society has developed that we recognise in the Constitution and legislation giving effect to constitutional provisions that in fundamental matters of importance children have a right to form a view, have it heard and given due weight in cases that affect them.</p>  <p>  The Bill brings clarity to adoption legislation and removes many outdated legal anomalies.  In particular, it removes the condition that married parents may not voluntarily place their child for adoption and that a step-parent cannot adopt his or her partner's child without the requirement being met that the biological parent has apply to adopt his or her own child.  The Bill also contains provisions giving legislative effect to the Family and Children Relationships Bill which provides for the adoption of a child by non-married couples, including civil partners and cohabiting couples.</p>  <p>  The make-up of Irish family life has changed enormously and the Bill recognises these changes and allows for a wealth of diversity in Irish families.  Census 2011 indicated that Irish families were increasingly diverse and that an increasing percentage of children were living in family types other than those headed by married parents.  This change in the make-up of family life has occurred in every county in Ireland.  Census data from 2011 showed that there were over 7,000 lone-parent households in County Kildare.  The data also display 3,000 cohabiting couples with 11,114 children.  The number of children living in households headed by cohabiting couples increased by 41% between 2006 and 2011.  The Central Statistics Office's vital statistics data also indicate that in 2011 some 25,190 children were born outside marriage or civil partnerships.  This number continues to increase year on year.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes and fully supports this long overdue adoption legislation which gives legislative effect to the constitutional change which requires that the views of the child be heard and given due weight in adoption cases.  Many children in long-term foster care have for many years held a strong desire to be adopted by their foster families, but they could not be adopted owing to the archaic provisions contained in adoption legislation which was more relevant to the 19th century than 21st century Ireland.  Many thousands of children - close to 2,000 per year - have gone through the care system in the interim owing to this decision and have lost the benefit of being part of a family in the eyes of the law.  One can only imagine the potentially harmful consequences this has had on their sense of belonging and home, their identity and rights to succession and inheritance.  Up to 2,000 children could become eligible for adoption as a result of the change proposed in the legislation.  However, the level of resources in place in the adoption system can only support a handful of children in progressing through the system on an annual basis.  It is worrying that there is no resourcing plan in place to accompany this legislation.  Unless resources are put in place in the adoption system, I worry that backlogs will impose another painful delay on the families involved and prevent children in foster care from progressing swiftly through the adoption process.  If we consider the current long delays in the family courts, it is deeply worrying to think how they will be severely exacerbated by possibly thousands of new adoption cases.  The absence of an aspiration on the part of the Government to establish new family courts is worrying.  Without some reform in this area, there is little hope of alleviating the long delays in family law cases.</p>  <p>  Another concern expressed relates to children's rights to information and to trace.  It is strange that in Parts 2 and 3 of the recently commenced Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 there are explicit rights to access information and identity tracing for children conceived through donor-assisted human reproduction, yet adopted children are still waiting for a Bill to be published to provide a similar right in the context of adoption.  This is lamentable, given all of the public attention this issue has received in the past few years and the tragic stories that have been uncovered.  We must ensure in practice that children's views are heard and their best interests ascertained during adoption proceedings.</p>  <p>  Currently, married couples cannot place their child for adoption.  The Bill provides that married parents may place a child for adoption on a voluntary basis, where both parents place him or her for adoption and consent to the making of the adoption order.  As Geoffrey Shannon, the Government's special rapporteur on child protection, said during the children's rights referendum, removing this archaic ban will help to stop children from drifting rudderless in the child protection system and allow many children in long-term foster care to be adopted.  He said the amendment would give all children equal rights, no matter the status of their parents.  Allowing for the adoption of marital children will end the legal limbo in which a significant number of children find themselves and which more would face in the future if this provision was to remain unchanged.  It is important to stress that this will not in any way lead to more children entering the care system.  Instead, it will lead to the right children entering the care system, which is what matters most.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for a change in the criteria under which the High Court may, in a case involving parental failure, make an order authorising, without parental consent, the adoption of a child who has been in the custody of and had a home with applicants such as foster parents or relatives for a period of at least 18 months.  This amendment is not about removing children from their families and placing them in care.  It is about ensuring those children in the care system will no longer be left to drift and will be given a second chance.  The revised criteria are that the child must be in the custody of and have had a home with the applicants for a continuous period of not less than 18 months, that the High Court shall be satisfied that the parents of the child have failed in their duty towards him or her for a period of 36 months and that there is no reasonable prospect that they will be able to care for him or her in a manner that will not prejudicially affect his or her safety or welfare.</p>  <p>  In recent months I have met families living in south Kildare where the children are caught up in complicated legal proceedings.  These children have already had to endure very tough times and are still in a legal limbo, where after each court appearance they may be moved to a different address.  I had the privilege to hear in depth about two cases where children had been fostered and with their foster families for a number of years.  In both cases there is a desire on the part of the foster parents to adopt the children and on the part of the children to be legally part of the family.</p><p>It is fabulous to see the love and opportunities these children are now experiencing after the turbulent early years they have had to endure.  The Bill will allow adoptions such as these to take place and ensure a brighter future for these children.</p> <p> Most significantly, the Bill provides that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in any application or proceedings under the Adoption Act 2010 and that the views of the child shall be ascertained by the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the court, as the case may be, and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  Surely this is what we strive for in every aspect of life and every piece of legislation before this House.  The best interests of all children lie in ensuring every citizen is assured of safe, affordable housing and receives the best education, irrespective of his or her background.  It is a fundamental duty of an elected representative to ensure that we always act in the best interests of all citizens and, in particular, invest in the future of generations to come.</p> <p> The Bill provides for the adoption of a child by his or her step-parent without the requirement for the birth parent to adopt his or her own child.  Previously, if a step-parent wanted to adopt, both the child's birth parent and step-parent had to apply to adopt.  The birth parent became an adopting parent, but it is good that, under the Bill, the birth parent will continue to be the child's parent and the step-parent will be the adoptive parent.  The Coalition for Mother and Baby Home Survivors, CMABS, referred to this anomalous law as ridiculous and woefully outdated.  The Bill corrects this anomaly, introducing an amendment whereby the birth parent will continue to be the child's parent and the step-parent will be the adoptive parent.</p> <p> Many elements of the Bill bring greater clarity to adoption legislation.  It provides security for children and strengthens families.  It strengthens our laws which have been out of step to deal with the realities of modern life.  These changes which clear the way for non-married couples and civil partners to adopt jointly are long overdue and welcome.  I fully support and commend the Bill, especially in alleviating the legal limbo in which families and children in long-term foster care have found themselves for too long.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800042#QQ00200"><p>First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, on her appointment and wish her well in this portfolio.  She has many years of experience dealing with it in her own work and I have no doubt that she will bring her experience to bear in her work in this term.</p><p>I welcome the content, the intent and consequence of the Bill.  It is progressive and ambitious legislation which pushes the boundaries of our very traditional society.  It met with quite a lot of resistance, particularly coming up to the referendum and even since.  Adoption, particularly in the past, has left many families reeling because of what they have been through.  It has scarred individuals and some might see it as a black mark on our society because of the way we have handled it to date.  There has been a failure on the part of the State to adequately take into account the views of the child and put him or her at the centre of any adoption, as should always be the case.  </p><p>The Bill recognises the changing nature of Irish society and family life.  It shows respect for the varying family arrangements that are now common throughout Ireland and recognises that not every family is headed up by a heterosexual couple.  It moves us towards a more modern adoption service, one which focuses, first and foremost, on the child.  This is exceptionally positive and long overdue.</p><p>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Ireland ratified in 1992 acknowledges the family as the fundamental unit of society.  It stresses the role of parents as primary care givers with responsibility for the upbringing of their children and obliges governments to support them in fulfilling their roles.  While there is an obligation on the State to support parents in fulfilling their role while parenting their child or children, there is also a responsibility on parents to look after their children, rear them properly and look after their well-being.  It is a two-way street and the obligation does not rest solely on the State.  It is a very privileged position to be a parent and with that privilege comes great responsibility.</p><p>The main principles of the convention are that the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in all actions concerning him or her and that the child's views must be considered in all matters affecting him or her.  This can bring difficulties in how we ascertain the child's views, particularly where there may be communication difficulties and taking into account the age of the child and his or her maturity.  Furthermore, every child is unique and special.  That challenges us to vindicate the rights of the child, but these are challenges we must meet and face head on.</p><p>Contrary to the views of certain groups, this legislation is not an attack on families.  It continues to recognise the role of the family, but it puts before all else the well-being of the child and ensures children are given an opportunity to be heard and listened to in matters affecting them.  There are conflicting rights and a balance needs to be struck.  There are the rights of parents and the family unit and these rights are enshrined in the Constitution, but there are also the rights of the child.  I have experience of working in the family courts and there is often a very difficult balance to be struck.  This places a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of judges and members of the legal profession, guardians <i>ad litem</i>, parents and the counsel involved in these cases to ensure the family unit is not unnecessarily upset while we vindicate the rights of the child and ensure he or she is heard.</p><p>There are dissenting views on this legislation and it is important to recognise the concerns of those who do not support it.  However, I ask them to recognise the many years of research on this issue that has led us to this point, as well as the legislative changes that have taken place before this, namely, in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution Act 2012 which was passed following the children's rights referendum in November 2012 and allowed for the insertion of a new Article 42A into the Constitution.  This article provides for the rights and protection of all children but specifically the rights and protection of children at risk who are in need of child protection services and-or involved in adoption proceedings.  The intention of the amendment was to deal with children in need in difficult situations and at risk.  It is difficult to balance the very important role the family unit plays in Irish society with a recognition of the many hundreds and thousands of children at risk who are in need of protection services and may at some point need adoption services.  Without this legislation, the adoption services are not fit for purpose.</p><p>It is important to note also that Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance have welcomed the Bill.  These organisations are at the forefront of child protection and deal on a daily basis with children and families in difficult situations.  It is important that they are on board with this legislaiton.  They were involved in the consultation process and welcome the contents of the Bill.  Barnardos described it as another crucial piece of legislation in prioritising children.  That is the key and goes to the very heart of why we are making these legislative changes; we are putting children's needs at the heart of adoption.  That must always be our priority.</p><p>The provisions of the Bill broaden eligibility for adoption to all children.  For example, children who have been reared by foster parents by reason of the failure of their own parents to look after them will be eligible for adoption in more circumstances than at present and the Bill will allow for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child, including a child whose parents are married.  This is probably the key part of the legislation because many children are caught up in the protection services or living in foster care for a long time but whose parents, while married, may never be in a position to take them back into their care.  There is now the possibility for a child to continue with the family who are fostering him or her and to have a fresh start in life.  Children were left in limbo to the point where they were in long-term foster care and, no matter how unlikely it was that they would ever return to their biological parents, they could never be considered for adoption, even where it was in their best interests.  This clearly was an anomaly in our law and did not reflect the best interests of the child or allow common sense to prevail.</p><p>I welcome the section of the Bill which deals with civil partners and cohabitees.  It is very positive and reflects the diverse nature of the country and the different types of family who can provide very good care for children.  It reflects the different living arrangements, wherein parents may or may not be married, heterosexual or straight, cohabiting or otherwise.  Whatever the scenario, that should not be the basis on which a person is judged fit to take care of a child.</p><p>This allows far more scope for these couples to come forward whatever their circumstances when they believe they can offer a good home to a child.<br/><br/>The new Bill will allow civil partners and cohabitees the opportunity to adopt, should they so wish, giving legislative effect to the Children and Family Relationships Act.  This is an extremely positive step forward in our laws in this area, recognising the diverse nature of family life in Ireland and the many good couples who can provide a good home for a child.<br/><br/>One of the key areas that still needs to be addressed is improving the efficiency and cost of the adoption process.  Any person who has been through the process of adopting a child will say it quite arduous, draining, emotionally stressful and costly.  These are areas in which we can make changes to make it easier to come through the process.  Obviously, there will be proper checks and balances and proper scrutiny of those who come forward.  However, it should not be cumbersome and costly for couples to come through the process.<br/><br/>We must ensure there is proper guidance in assessing parental failure and what exactly this means.  In the assessment of any such term - I am going on my own experience - my interpretation of parental failure could be very different from that of the person sitting beside me.  That is the difficulty in the interpretation of such a term.  It can be quite objective.  As it is an objective interpretation, guidance is required to provide a workable definition of parental failure and on how it might work in practice.  I appreciate that this may require review at a later stage when we see how it operates in practice, but to arrive at a situation where one can say for definite that there is parental failure in a particular case, the threshold should not be so high as to preclude anybody from ever reaching it.  That is an important factor.  I understand the concerns raised by individuals and groups that one could arbitrarily decide that there is parental failure and remove a child, whereas another individual might say the threshold had not been reached.  Clarity in that regard is crucial for the operation of the legislation.  <br/><br/>The guardian<i>ad litem</i>system needs to be reformed.  My experience of it is that it can be unnecessarily costly for those involved.  We can look at making it more efficient and still maintain a good service and ensure a child is properly represented.  Obviously, the guardian<i>ad litem</i>is the representative of the child in a court scenario, but it is important that taxpayers' money is not wasted.  The system must be properly run and streamlined to make it better. <br/><br/>We must ensure proper guidelines are in place for how we go about gaining the child's views on a particular issue.  This is something I have seen, although not quite in this sensitive scenario, but, for example, if I was to work on a case where there might have been an injury to a child and he or she was asked to come forward to describe to the judge that injury or its effect on him or her, it could be very stressful for him or her and often there is a requirement to go into the judge's chambers in order that the judge can have a confidential conversation with the child.  There is a need for guidance in that regard because not every child will have the confidence to articulate his or her views in a way that will assist the judge to the level at which he or she needs to be assisted.  We need to work on how we can gather the views of a child who may also have communication difficulties.  He or she may have the mental capacity to form his or her own views, but he or she may not have the capacity to articulate these views in the necessary manner.  This will be a difficult issue for us to get to grips with to form the guidelines that are necessary, but it is one on which we need to focus.  It will come to bear quite soon in certain cases and the guidelines required will be very important.<br/><br/>In this legislation, all of the guidelines and the D&aacute;il debates it is important not to lose sight of the fact that at the centre of this issue are real children and real families who are going through the system.  It is easy to comment as an observer, as somebody who is not going through the process and experiencing the stress involved, but at the heart of everything we do we should always remember that there are real people involved.  <br/><br/>The legislation is sensible.  It is much needed and common sense seems to have prevailed.  I, therefore, welcome it.  It is both progressive and ambitious.  It was difficult at times to progress it, but I am delighted that so many stakeholders are on board with it.  Clearly, a very good consultation process was entered into.  In performing her duties in this role I ask the Minister to take on board a couple of the issues I have outlined, on which I would like to see further work done.  I assure her of my full support and will be happy to give any assistance I can in that regard.  I welcome the Bill.  I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to speak to it as it is important legislation.  In years to come we will look back at this point and see that we made a very good change in our adoption legislation, a change that will positively affect children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-05-18a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016051800043#RR00300"><p>I thank Deputies for their support for the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 and their constructive, often passionate, contributions to the debate yesterday and today.  I also thank them for their expressed willingness to work in a constructive fashion with me, as I lead the legislative and policy agenda for children and young people.  In doing so I am aware that they come with a great diversity of identities and experience on which they draw as they contribute to the law-making process.  Some of the Deputies who spoke were adopted; many of them are champions of children; some have been psychologists or lawyers or worked at the coalface with children and families who have not had the same opportunities as the majority of us have had owing to social and economic backgrounds, health, including mental health, challenges, or other varied circumstances.  It is that diversity of experience that will enable us to work together to create the best law for children.</p>  <p>  As I said yesterday, the Bill will have real and significant consequences for children.  While the number of adoptions taking place is lower than in previous years - I have heard some Deputies refer to the potential for a significant increase in the light of this legislation - each single adoption is a hugely significant event in the life of the child concerned and, of course, that of his or her parents or guardians. </p>  <p>  It is timely that the Bill is before the House.  It will be another important critical ingredient placed on the Statute Book under the canopy of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and others correctly mentioned, to give legal effect to the children's rights referendum.  As I said yesterday, this will send a message to future generations that the protection and welfare of children are among the highest values of our society.  Deputy Catherine Connolly, among her very helpful and constructive remarks, referred to that part of my speech as rhetoric - lovely rhetoric.  Yes, it was.  I believe in using rhetoric in the best sense of the political, philosophic meaning of the term.  I know from my human rights and social change work that there is a place for rhetoric in the fight for significant social and economic change because it can touch our hearts and spirits on the very long journey towards a fair and equal society that supports children, families and communities in cherishing all children equally.  Rhetoric can lift our hope, sharpen our vision and set a context for us in dealing with the historical contradictions that form the context for our debates in this Chamber.  It is true that the rhetoric in this and others places can be very different from what is happening on the ground.  I know some of that ground, too, not all of it but some of it in my work over many years.  Therefore, I welcome and will continue to embrace heartily Deputies' references to what is happening on the ground as we make law together.</p><p>Before I talk about particular issues dealt with in the Bill, let me comment on two additional items which were referred to in Deputies' speeches.  The first refers to the wider ground and the arena in which the Bill has emerged.  I acknowledge the very insightful, logical and helpful contribution made by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, particularly, although not only, his remarks about section 23 of the Bill which provides for revised criteria under which the High Court will authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent.  The Deputy asked what would happen if the State was responsible for creating the conditions wherein parents ended up neglecting their children and the State was party to the process that had led to parental failure?  That is a brilliant question.  The Deputy also referred to the increase in homelessness and, in particular, how many children found themselves in emergency accommodation owing to the State's failure to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis.  Perhaps that might be one of the conditions.  Two responses occurred to me immediately.  First, I am deeply concerned about the increase in homelessness among children and commit that its reduction is and will continue to be a priority of mine for as long as I hold this ministry.  It was one of the reasons one of my first visits as Minister was to the Focus Point centre in Tallaght where this issue was at the core of our discussions and its contributions to solutions to this problem.  Second, let us think about whether amendments to the Bill are required or possible in the light of this much wider concern and whether safeguards are required.<br/><br/>The second item referred to by several Deputies was the concern about a section within the programme for Government that linked child benefit with data systems to monitor school attendance.  Deputies, rightly, raised concerns about this measure and I share their concerns.  The Ministers, Deputies Leo Varadkar and Richard Bruton, and I have, subsequent to requesting the views of our various Departments, discussed the matter and I confirm that we will most certainly not pursue any stick approach.  Reducing income supports for families is not an effective means to support them in their efforts to keep their children in school.  We will, however, ask our Departments to review the best way to ensure the collection and linking of data in order that children's attendance and participation in school will be supported by the State.<br/><br/>I turn now to other matters relating to the Bill specifically, as well as to matters raised by Deputies, including possible amendments and the issue of information and tracing.  I am aware of the work done by the last Government on this issue.  As Deputies will be aware, in July 2015 it referred the heads and general scheme of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny and that committee produced its report in November.  The report was considered by my Department and a number of amendments to the heads and general scheme of the Bill were approved by my predecessor, former Deputy James Reilly.  On that basis the last Government approved the drafting of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill in December.  The drafting of the Bill is under way and I can assure the House of my commitment to progressing the Bill and having it published as soon as possible this year.  It is one of my priorities.  The Bill will provide, for the first time, a statutory entitlement to identity information for adopted persons and for structured and regulated access to information and tracing services.  It will provide that an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted prior to commencement of the Bill will be provided with the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, subject to certain conditions.  It will also provide that those who were the subject of incorrect birth registrations - imagine what that must be like for the persons concerned - and those who were in long-term informal care arrangements may avail of an information and tracing service.<br/><br/>Some Deputies asked how adopted persons accessed their records today.  There is a concern in that the adoption and information and tracing services are currently provided by Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland or an accredited agency, depending on who holds the records.  An improvement plan has been introduced to address the significant and unacceptable waiting times and the waiting lists and waiting times are reducing as a result, although not fast enough, I am sure, for those participating in the process.  Furthermore, a system of prioritisation has been introduced that ensures the assessment focuses on those in greater need such as applicants who are over 70 years of age or those who have a serious medical illness.  Deputy Joan Burton indicated in her comments yesterday the possibility of bringing forward an amendment to the Bill to incorporate attention to information and tracing and the concerns about the right of an adopted child to his or her identity.  I would be very interested in exploring that potential and discussing the possibilities in that regard.<br/><br/>There is widespread recognition and acceptance by stakeholder interests, including my Department, that the <i>guardian ad litem </i>service arrangements need to be significantly reformed.  My Department is working to address the significant shortcomings in the existing arrangements, with a view to making them fit for purpose and having a nationally organised, high quality and sustainable service in place.  To inform the development of the policy proposals, my Department recently consulted many stakeholders on key areas of reform.  Consultation is integral to our getting the law right and correct.  My Department is examining significant policy issues and possible legal issues arising from the consultation process and working to resolve them.  I can assure Deputies that consultation in this regard is not just about them telling us what they think and then us doing whatever we want to do.  It is listened to deeply and the possibilities arising from it are considered, particularly in the examination of the legal possibilities.  My Department is working towards the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to radically reform the provisions for the appointment of <i>guardians ad litem</i>under the Child Care Act 1991 and at the earliest possible date.<br/><br/>I note the concerns raised by Deputies about section 23 of the Bill which provides for an amendment to section 54 of the Adoption Act 2010.  In Ireland the vast majority of children live in loving, caring families and never require the assistance of the State's child protection and welfare services.  However, some families may need help and support in parenting their children.  The range of responses of the State to support and protect a child is vast and incorporates much of what Tusla is engaged in.  In the more serious cases children may be received into care, either at the request of the parent or by a court order, removed from the family and cared for by people other than their parents.  In this scenario, all options for the care of children are considered, including supervision orders, care orders, guardianship and adoption.  As Deputies are aware, currently the High Court may authorise the Adoption Authority of Ireland to make an adoption order and dispense with the consent of any person whose consent is necessary to the making of the adoption order where it is satisfied on certain criteria which include the likelihood that parental failure will continue without interruption until the child attains the age of 18 years.  The proposed amendment in section 23 of the Bill will not change the belief that, where possible, the best place for children is with their families.  However, the Bill now provides that the High Court can dispense with consent only where it is satisfied that the parental failure has been for a continuous period of not less than three years preceding the time of making the application; that the parents have, unfortunately and for whatever reasons, failed in their duty to the extent that the welfare of the child is prejudicially affected; that there is no reasonable prospect that the parents will be able to care for the child and that the failure constitutes abandonment - this is a strong and difficult word to hear but it is the reality in some cases; that adoption is a proportionate measure; and that the child has been in the custody of and has had a home with the applicants for a continuous period of not less than 18 months.</p><p>The revised criteria will provide that adoption is an option for more children who are currently in long-term foster care, once the criteria set out in section 23 are met.  This option may represent a second chance for those children of a stable and secure family life.</p> <p> Many Deputies referred in many ways to the question of resources, whether within the adoption process itself or with regard to the care process or the work that is now undertaken by Tusla.  I am happy to say that, in 2016, the allocation to Tusla has been increased by some &euro;38 million over last year's provision to address the immediate priorities identified by Tusla for its attention in 2016.  This will bring the agency's current funding to &euro;662.4 million and there will be a total capital provision of &euro;13.5 million.  That increased provision for Tusla in 2016 strengthens its overall base funding position to ensure the agency has the capacity to respond to both areas of unmet need and anticipated demand during 2016.</p> <p> I thank all Deputies who were present for the debate today and yesterday and who welcome and support the Bill.  I believe the debate has been very insightful and constructive.  I look forward to further debate on Committee Stage.  If Deputies or parties wish to raise, bring forward or discuss amendments they may propose prior to that time, I will be delighted to discuss them and my door is open to them.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
