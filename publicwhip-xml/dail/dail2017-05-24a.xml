In essence, the State's capacity to investigate serious white-collar crime has been shown to be inept, negligible, wasteful and virtually redundant.  It raises fundamental questions about the continued existence and effectiveness of the ODCE and makes it an imperative to consider alternative mechanisms to deal with white-collar crime in this country.</p>  <p>  This has been, by any measure, a catastrophic systemic failure.  The reputation of the ODCE is in shreds.  There was a nine-year investigation that cost tens of millions of euro.  Documents were shredded and the method of taking witness statements was fundamentally flawed.  The judge described them as statements by committee.  The ODCE was trying to build a case rather than investigating a case impartially and independently.  There was a high degree of coaching and cross-contamination in the preparation of statements.  The statement-making process involved negotiations between investigators and solicitors A&amp;L Goodbody, and resulted in witness statements included in the book of evidence that had been drafted entirely by people other than the witnesses themselves. </p><p>In the judge's words, the statements of Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kelly were scripted, coached, and contaminated by the views of others, including the ODCE.  They were cross-contaminated in every significant detail from start to finish.  Significantly, the ODCE accepts this criticism.  There had been missing evidence, evidence of innocence had not been pursued and so on.</p> <p> The handling of this case shatters public confidence in the prosecution of white-collar crime in this country.  The jury never got to make the call because of the shambolic handling of the case.  This raises fundamental questions.  Given the gravity of the case and what it reveals, will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, comes before the D&aacute;il to make a statement on the case and take questions?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister has received a report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement in respect of this case or that she has sought such a report from him?  Has the Government considered this?  Let us be straight; there were indications of how this case might turn out for quite some time.  All the issues have now been revealed in the public domain.  It seems that the Government must have considered these matters at some stage.  What is its response?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400004#B00200"><p>I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Despite all the criticism of and cynicism about politics, at least there is political answerability in the sense that a Minister in charge of something like this would face instant dismissal.  The situation is that this person has been acquitted and is not guilty of any offence.  As a result, the taxpayer takes up all the costs involved.  The indications given by Judge Aylmer are very clear, as the Deputy has pointed out.</p>  <p>  The ODCE is a statutory independent body.  Its mother Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has no responsibility or power of enforcement.  The ODCE takes its own legal advice.  There were garda&iacute; attached to the ODCE in the beginning but they were not involved in the way this case was taken.  The judge did point out that the most fundamental error was the way in which they went about taking evidence from the auditors of Anglo Irish Bank, who were both from the firm of accountants involved.  He said that it was intended that their statements would be taken in the normal way by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were then attached to the ODCE.  Instead, however, the statements were obtained through solicitors from a legal firm.</p>  <p>  The ODCE pointed out that it has now undergone substantial organisational change and that it was simply not equipped to undertake parallel investigations on the scale involved.  I want to say this: I have not spent the past six years as head of Government and making very difficult decisions only to hear again now the allegation in respect of white-collar crime that people can walk away, that nobody is guilty and that nothing is being done about it.</p></speech>

I can confirm that when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, had responsibility for jobs, requests by the ODCE to his then Department for resources were granted.  Now I find that the ODCE says it was simply not equipped to take parallel investigations on the scale involved.  I can confirm that the Minister has asked the Director of Corporate Enforcement for a full report, including on the role of all professionals involved in this case.  That report will cover the issues involved since 2008 when this case commenced - almost ten years ago.  Nothing is ruled out.</p>  <p>  When Deputy Catherine Murphy had her full group, she put forward a proposition for a statutory standing body in the D&aacute;il to deal with matters of corruption and so on.</p><p>The Minister will bring this before Government in due course.  The Government will consider it next week, but I want the Minister to carry out an absolute review of what happened.  It is not good enough.  I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  We cannot have a situation where an independent statutory agency that does not take legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General proceeds on its own and seeks resources from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Despite provision of the latter, this trial collapsed.  We know why the first trial collapsed.</p></speech>

Is he suggesting that the Minister, by means of an early warning system, would not have been alerted to the impending disaster?  The dogs on the street knew about the impending disaster for some time.  Indeed, the Director of Public Prosecutions was alerted to the issue as well as the manner and methodology of the collecting and making of statements as far back as 2010.  Hence, I say there has been systemic failure across the system.  People are operating in silos, apparently.  Did the Minister received any report, any early warning or any notification whatsoever from her Department officials about this case or about the ODCE failures relating to it?  Is the Taoiseach suggesting that it is only from now on that the Department and the Government are going to respond to this case?  It is inconceivable that there would not have been early notification to the Minister about the impending disaster that was about to unfold in respect of the case.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned that it is a matter for the Oireachtas.  It seems the Government does not yet have a policy response to this matter.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland should be asked about the optimal structural, approach and methodology of dealing with and enhancing the State's capacity to combat white-collar crime.  The public will be angry because the capacity of the State to pursue white-collar crime has been laid bare.  Something has to happen as a result of this in terms of a proper considered policy response.</p></speech>

First, the ODCE is an entirely independent statutory authority.  Therefore, it is not subject to Government direction.  Second, the trial was under way.  While concerns were being raised, it would not have been possible to interfere with a trial that was under way in the courts.</p>  <p>  The comments made by Judge Aylmer speak for themselves.  They are an indictment of the ODCE.  The ODCE had some success in 2014 and 2016.  In April of this year, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice relating to a fraud and entered a plea of guilty.</p>  <p>  I think that the ODCE looked for resources and expertise, in so far as I can understand this, and that those requests were granted.  When the ODCE says that it was simply not equipped to undertake parallel investigations on the scale involved, one would have thought that there would have been a specific request for the capacity to take in necessary expertise or whatever, either through Government or from outside sources, to deal with parallel investigations.  In any event, it was not possible for Government to intervene in any way in a pending court case and was not possible for Government to give directions to an independent statutory body.</p>  <p>  Since the current director was appointed, quite a number of changes have taken place.  That does not deal with the fact that this case has gone on for ten years and is one of the longest and most expensive in the history of the State.  The taxpayer has to pick up the tab here because the person who was acquitted yesterday has already been declared bankrupt.</p>  <p>  The Minister will come before the D&aacute;il, make a statement, give a report and answer questions on this.  She is to receive a full and detailed report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement-----</p></speech>

This blatant lack of accountability contrasts sharply with how people of few means and little power or influence are treated.  This goes to the heart of public alienation from politics and disillusionment with the agencies of this State.  The Taoiseach's answers today will not assuage people's concerns.</p>  <p>  I have also raised with him the need for this State to get serious about white-collar crime, the need to develop a proper and credible approach to investigating and prosecuting such offences.  Yesterday, the State's trial of the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank, Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, collapsed.  My focus is not on that trial, it is on role of the ODCE in this sorry affair and the lack of will by the establishment to investigate white-collar crime.  In 2016, there were 35 staff in the ODCE.  They were assisted by five garda&iacute;.  This gives an insight into the State's attitude towards white-collar crime and corporate enforcement.  Under the Taoiseach's watch the staff of this office has been cut from 42 to 35.  The number of garda&iacute; has been cut by half.  In 2005, 2006 and 2007, the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, refused requests from the office to increase its workforce by 20.  The office at that time described its resources as wholly inadequate.  The Taoiseach of the day, Bertie Ahern, dismissed this.  That was when the bankers were running amok.  They cost the people of this State billions of euro and yet there is still no law against reckless lending.  In 2014, the lack of resources to which I refer was highlighted by a senior barrister who said, "It's enough to make the tin-pot dictator of a banana republic blush."  It was not a Shinner who said that, it was an individual who is an expert in white-collar crime and a senior barrister.  Of course, if someone is accused of welfare fraud, the full weight of this Government will be visited on them.  When it comes to wrecking the economy, reckless lending, fixers fees and complex interest relating to billions of euro, however, the State looks the other way.  This Government spends &euro;5 million on the ODCE.  That is &euro;5 million to investigate white-collar crime.  As Deputy Pearse Doherty pointed out, by contrast it spends over &euro;17 million on our membership of the European Space Agency.  Is that where its priorities lie?  It is little wonder that the judge in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial pointed out the shortcomings of the investigation conducted by the ODCE.</p>  <p>  Even at this late stage would the Taoiseach agree that we should draw on international best practice for tackling white-collar crime and that we should get rid of the ODCE and replace it with appropriate and properly-resourced agencies and strong, robust legislation?</p></speech>

It has its independence and statutory authority and therefore it was not subject, and is not subject, to direction by the Minister or the Government, although it was set up by the Government for a very specific purpose.  When the current director was appointed with effect from August 2012, the ODCE's investigation on the FitzPatrick case had been completed and the file passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The scale and complexity of the investigation into the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank was unprecedented in the history of the State, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin pointed out.</p>  <p>  In light of the complexities of modern corporate law enforcement, the current director has overseen a number of organisational improvements in the ODCE.</p><p>Those improvements include reorganising the structures of the office, recruiting additional expertise, most notably five forensic accountants, because clearly in the determination of the case in the first place the forensic analysis was not strong enough.  A digital forensic specialist is due to begin with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the coming weeks.  Fundamentally, it has amended the investigative procedures used by the office with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now taking the lead on all criminal investigations.  This is where there has clearly been a weakness in the system.  While the ODCE may deal with civil cases at a lower level, when it comes to serious criminal law, we need to be able to deal with it with serious criminal forensic intent.  That obviously was not what was followed here, as outlined by Judge Aylmer in his comments yesterday.  There have been a number of successful prosecutions.  Clearly the judge has made a decision.  The trial is over and Mr. FitzPatrick is a free man.  The taxpayer takes up the tab here.  The Minister has requested a full and detailed report from the director of the ODCE.  The Minister will come before the D&aacute;il, make her statement and answer questions.  The director is prepared to go before the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  The Government will reflect on this next week and when the report from the director becomes available to the Minister, it will be published and made available for everybody.  We need to reflect on the fundamental question here.  </p></speech>

That is a complete, sharp contradiction of what the Taoiseach has just asserted.  The fact is there is one law for the elites.  This is deliberate and very conscious.  There is another law for everyone else.  That is endorsed by the successive policies and the historical attitude of the two larger parties here.  The fact there is no appropriate and robust legislation dealing with these issues is another example of the way the State turns the other way.  The Taoiseach has also acknowledged this principal law enforcement regulatory agency has not conducted its business properly.  For example, the chief investigator has no previous experience.  He has admitted in evidence he made many fundamental errors, including the destruction of documents.  Who appointed him as chief investigator given his lack of experience?  To whom was he accountable?  Why were garda&iacute; not involved in the taking of statements from the two key witnesses?  It goes on and on.  The Taoiseach is responsible.</p></speech>

It completely lost sight of what was involved.  The Deputy said there is no robust legislation in place here.  In 2014 two gentlemen were convicted for the giving of unlawful financial assistance by Anglo for the purchase of its own shares.  In 2016 both of them were convicted for fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty.  The second conviction was for failing to maintain a bank register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty.  The law in those cases actually worked in respect of white-collar crime.  The Deputy mentioned comments made by the then Minister in 2015.</p><p>When the current director was appointed in 2012, the investigation of the FitzPatrick case had been completed.  It is in the space before the current director was appointed that the judge made his damning comments in regard to the structure and management capacity of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, at that time.  I would expect that when Mr. Drennan appears before the Oireachtas committee, he will provide every detail necessary to point out the changes in structure that apply now.  The question is whether the ODCE is now fit for purpose or whether we need to clarify where the criminal law kicks in.</p></speech>

However, we also depend on our investigating and prosecuting authorities to ensure that proper, thorough, accurate and convincing investigations of allegations of crime take place, particularly crimes that have rocked the nation.  The manifest incompetence of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the case brought against Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick has not only caused a public outcry but it beggars belief.  As to the notion that it is a matter of resources, coaching of witnesses and tampering with evidence are not matters of resources.  The same issues arise when we talk about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are fundamental ways in which proper conduct of business takes place.</p>  <p>  This case brings to light that we need to tackle these matters.  Some suggestions have been put forward.  We need to ensure these fundamental questions result in fundamental answers being brought and discussed by the House.  We will participate in this discussion.  However, we must also acknowledge that much of the root cause of public anger relates to the cost to the people of bailing out the banks.  The desire of the public to see convictions of those who gambled with the economic security of our State is absolutely understandable.  Criminal convictions are not, however, the only way to tackle public anger over the bailout of the banks.  As the banks return to stability and profitability, we should begin to use the funding they generate to repair the social damage done in the State.  The investment made to bail out the banks came from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and people are entitled to see a result from that investment.</p>  <p>  Last week, the House voted in favour of a Labour Party proposal to delay the sale of the State's shares in Allied Irish Banks until such time as we can invest the proceeds in vitally needed infrastructure.  Disturbingly, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has made known his intention to disregard this vote.  If the Government disagrees with the vote of the House, it can try to rescind it, but that is not, I understand, the course to be taken.  The Minister referred to a commitment in the programme for Government which has no more standing than a resolution of the House.  Even if that were not the case, the programme for Government simply commits the State to use the banking shareholdings in the best interests of the people.  Few would argue with the proposition that it is infinitely more in the interests of the Irish people to invest these moneys in vitally needed schools, hospitals and roads than in taking 1% off our national debt.</p>  <p>  Before the Taoiseach vacates his office in the coming weeks, will he ensure the vote of the D&aacute;il is respected and the policy adopted by the House last week is vindicated by his Government?  Any other action would undermine the legitimacy of and public confidence in this people's assembly.  Will he accept that proceeding with an initial public offering, IPO, in the face of the opposition of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is an action that undermines the legitimacy of the House?  Will he reconsider this bad proposal and work with my party and all other parties in the House to ensure the proceeds of this investment can benefit the people and that they get something back from the bailout of the banks?</p></speech>

Everybody before the Irish courts is innocent until proven guilty.  Now, the longest running trial in the history of the State has collapsed, the central individual is now free and acquitted and the taxpayer must take up the tab.</p> <p> All of these issues - a lack of procedural capacity, lack of investigative capacity and lack of forensic analysis competence - were all evident in the structure of the ODCE prior to the current director being appointed in August 2012 where serious changes have taken place.  The Minister will outline that to the D&aacute;il and take questions on it.  Director Drennan will be happy to go before the Oireachtas committee and have a serious discussion about it.  The Government will reflect on this next week.  The Minister will produce and publish the report when it is made available to her by the director.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government have already commented on the IPO in respect of a portion of AIB being sold on and being applied to the reduction of debt.  He has already made the point that it is a paper transfer in terms of whatever the value of the 25% being offered amounts to.  The Government is not under any pressure to deal with this because the question of infrastructure is one it is now considering in terms of the capital review.  All of the extent of the capital programme at the moment is up to &euro;42 billion between State agencies, PPPs and the Exchequer.  Yesterday, I pointed out the scale of what is available that is as yet unallocated, which is now the subject of a review here.</p> <p> It is also important, as Deputy Howlin is well aware, that we do not want a situation where we apply so much money to infrastructure that all of the inflation costs then result and developers continue to make the rewards from all of that.  It is much more important that the infrastructural needs are dealt with, and we are able to deal with these.  Yesterday, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were in Europe talking to the European Investment Bank about a number of major infrastructural projects, which can be accommodated through lending from the EIB at low interest rates long term.  Issues have already been mentioned, like the development of the metro, like the development of the major motorway from Cork to Limerick and others where potentially there is a stream of income that can come from those to pay off those loans.</p> <p> I respect the fact that the House made a decision last week in respect of a matter in regard to AIB, but Deputy Howlin will also respect the right and the responsibility of Government to make its decisions, and this decision has been publicly announced by Government for quite a long time and will stand in the context of what Government is doing.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach referred to having too much money but the capital review involves &euro;2.6 billion, which is paltry in investment terms.  There is no such thing as "too much money".  The additional &euro;3 billion that we would get from the sale of AIB would increase that to &euro;5.6 billion, which in itself is not enough.  That is why we have also argued for the rainy-day sum to be deployed for this purpose.</p>  <p>  The potential new Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has said that he will abandon the target set by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, of reducing our debt from 60% to 45%.  He will have it at 55%.  I welcome that, but we need to invest in our vital infrastructure now.  The EIB being able to give us money that we can deploy through PPPs for profit is not the issue.  Rather, it is the fiscal space that restricts how we spend it.  The Taoiseach knows that we had money for social housing from the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann facilities.  That was &euro;400 million that we could not spend because of the restrictions on the fiscal space.  This is not about the availability of money.  It is about readjusting the fiscal space.  I spent yesterday talking to the Germans, who are now well disposed towards accepting that adjustment.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach put this on hold?  Will he put the sale of AIB on hold until we get this agreement?</p></speech>

This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to staff shortages.  I want to list the theatres throughout the country where there have been closures because of staff shortages, as I believe this is a symptom of something else.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, had two full theatre closures over a six-week period due to staffing shortages, while Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital had one theatre closure for the same reason.  Theatre closures were reported in all constituent hospitals at the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  At St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, there were two to three theatres closed per day, depending on nursing shortages on the rota.  In St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny, an elective theatre closed because of staffing shortages.  A new theatre had not opened in Wexford General Hospital due to the difficulty in securing specialty theatre nursing staff.  This is a symptom of something much bigger, and that something bigger is pay and conditions for nurses.</p><p>I want to move on to something equally crucial which nobody has picked up on in the Chamber this week.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i>this week on mental health assessments for children is quite damning.  The report states:</p><blockquote>There were 2,520 children and young people on waiting lists for an initial assessment for mental health services in February 2017, an increase of 44 per cent on the same period last year, according to the HSE. ...  Barnardos has said these delays are having &ldquo;long-term unnecessary consequences&rdquo; on children and &ldquo;affecting every aspect of their development&rdquo;. ... It found almost 60 per cent have been waiting for more than a year while a quarter (26 per cent) have been waiting more than two years for an initial appointment.</blockquote><p>I find this incredible.  The reason Linn Dara has a shortage of nurses is that nurses are emigrating for better pay and conditions.  The past year has seen systematic cuts to their conditions and pay.  We are living not only with a two-tier health system but a two-tier pay system, whereby nurses and medical professionals are going to the private sector rather than the public sector.</p><p>The mantra of Fine Gael over the past six years has been to create the conditions for growth and prosperity.  However, the Taoiseach and his party have created the conditions for this crisis.  Fundamentally, I think the Taoiseach is a very decent man, but how can he, after six years, turn around, hold his head high and say that, in his tenure as Taoiseach, this was a success?</p><p>I would actually find that embarrassing as a member of the party he is in and as a citizen of this country.  How can the Taoiseach justify those cuts and that shortage in this country?</p></speech>

I respect his right to raise in the House any issues he feels strongly about.  When the predecessor to this Government was elected, we were blocked out of all the international markets, bond yields were at 15%, the unemployment rate was 15.2%, we were haemorrhaging jobs by the ten thousands, and there was despair and disillusionment all over the place.  Now, because of the sacrifice of the people, that has changed considerably.  We are now able to borrow money for the State at less than 1%.  The unemployment rate is down to 6.3% or 6.4% and is heading in the right direction.  More than 225,000 jobs have been created since the Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced the first Action Plan for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the recruitment of nurses.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has addressed this on a number of occasions.  There are now incentives for nurses.  Permanent contracts are offered to all new nurses coming out of highly specialised training here in Ireland.  There are opportunities for nurses to return home to work in the hospital service here in Ireland.  Not everybody will do that.  Young people in all walks of life tend to move to other countries for experience in travel and to develop their skills.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been working very hard on the issue of mental health.  Yesterday she went to the Linn Dara facility where only half of the 22 beds are occupied.  During her visit she was given assurances that any patients discharged from the Linn Dara facility are children who are discharged for clinical reasons only.  The HSE confirmed to the Minister of State that no young person will be discharged unless deemed clinically appropriate by their mental health team.  Nobody is being discharged to allow a bed to be closed.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also assured the Minister of State that for patients who are discharged for clinical reasons, dedicated follow-on support is available from the community-based child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  They will continue to be provided as required on a routine basis.  The Health Service Executive will also increase the capacity of the child and adolescent mental health day services during the summer to enhance the level of support available for those children and their families.</p>  <p>  The core issue facing the Linn Dara facility relates specifically to staff recruitment difficulties for mental health professionals, which unfortunately, as the Deputy has pointed out, reflects wider health system recruitment and retention issues.  I assure the Deputy that the problem facing the Linn Dara facility does not relate to funding availability but to staffing availability.  Intensive efforts are under way to increase staffing to allow more beds to be reallocated.  The HSE is actively engaged in a recruitment process, with a number of staff due to support the service in the near future.  I hope that will improve things.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;15.5 billion is now going into the health services.  All nurses coming out of Irish training institutions are offered permanent contracts giving them the opportunity to work at home here in our own hospitals.</p></speech>

It is not rocket science.  In a country where there is a lot of money sloshing around, we should have a health system that works for everybody, regardless of whether they are millionaires or unemployed.  That is how it should work.  Nobody should have to wait two years for any sort of assessment.  It is a disgrace.</p>  <p>  The closures at the Linn Dara facility and elsewhere come down to not paying nurses properly.  The past seven or eight years have taken their toll on nurses and other public sector workers.  They are demoralised and have to work an extra hour per week just to make ends meet.  This is the fundamental problem.  On Friday at 4 o'clock in Cherry Orchard there will be a protest over the cutbacks.</p>  <p>  There is another point about public sector pay.  I do not want to make it personal because I try to differentiate between the personal and political.</p><p>However, the Taoiseach is going to walk away with a massive pension in two weeks' time.  He will get a golden handshake and a pension of &euro;150,000.  Most people listening to these proceedings will be nauseated when they hear that.  That is the two-tier system we have in this country, where politicians go off into the sunshine with golden handshakes and big money.  Is the Taoiseach not ashamed of what he has left behind?</p></speech>

The problem has always been to get into the system and to have the capacity to deal with that.  That is why the Government has treated the health service as a priority, why &euro;14.5 billion has been allocated and why changes are constantly being made through primary care centres, home-care packages and the provision of community care teams to look after people.</p>  <p>  In respect of the payment situation the Deputy made for nurses, the same arguments are made for garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces, teachers, public servants and others.  Those talks are now beginning in full with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the trade unions.  The Minister hopes to engage intensively in those talks now with a view to concluding them by the end of June, and getting an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement where benefits were won and agreed with the unions involved.</p>  <p>  In respect of the matter relating to pensions, I will, when I leave this seat, continue to be paid as a backbench Deputy.</p></speech>

In the context of the appalling terrorist attack on young children in Manchester - from the impact of which people are still reeling and on which they are reflecting - attention must be drawn to whether our own structures and systems, particularly those relating to intelligence, are adequate to deal with this international terrorist threat.  The question is whether there is a need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the position in this regard.  I read reports this morning which are quite critical of our position and the lack of an effective single agency to deal with security and intelligence in this country.  Apparently, Ireland is the only EU state that does not have its own national security and intelligence agency.  That is a matter which requires fairly urgent examination.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that a national committee where different people come together every time there is a crisis is not the ideal response.  The issue is whether responsibility for crime and security remains with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether we have looked at an alternative to that or whether there is a more effective approach that enhances our capacity to prevent such atrocities from happening and to prevent extremism from developing within communities.  It is very important to counter the growth of violent extremism.  What is the Taoiseach's position on that?</p></speech>

I read the reports to which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin refers and, from what I understand, the perpetrator's family came from northern Africa in order to live in Manchester in England.</p><p>That has been replicated in a number of other locations here.  These savage acts of terrorism were carried out by people from local bases.  When one considers any event, concert or major sporting occasion in any country or here, no matter where one puts the perimeter of security people must congregate and move to where the event actually takes place and this movement is always outside of that perimeter.</p> <p> I have looked at the situation and have called a meeting for 7.30 a.m. tomorrow morning of all the agencies in defence, justice, transport and health.  We will look at the situation in Ireland.  I was very impressed with the immediate response to the tragedy of the first responders in Manchester.</p></speech>

Two and a half years ago the D&aacute;il and the Seanad voted to do this but the Government, thus far, has refused to act.  The Taoiseach still has time before he goes.  The Government recognises the state of Israel, which is fair enough, but the failure to stand up for the rights of Palestinians has led to multiple acts of oppression and discrimination, including the stripping away of Palestinian land and water rights.  This week there are more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners on a mass hunger strike.  The situation grows more desperate every single day.  The Taoiseach has been to the area and he knows what it was like years ago, but it has got worse since then.  Before the Taoiseach leaves office, he has the opportunity to honour the will of the Oireachtas and his own programme for Government.  Will the Government agree to recognise formally the state of Palestine?</p></speech>

Six months after the first debates on the legislation we still have not seen anything resembling draft regulations finally to tackle this area.

The question is how to prioritise these Bills, including Deputy Kenny's Bill, in order that they can move through the process.  I do not accept that there is an attempt to stymie the Bill, to delay it or not to have it put through.  What happens is that a number of Private Members' Bills are accepted but when they go through to the next Stage, the Department or the Minister has to do an extensive amount of work on them to make them suitable for purpose, taking into account the original intent of the Private Members' Bill.  The members of the committee are not subject to my direction.</p></speech>

In that, there is a reference to the building of capacity in our emergency departments and, in particular, there is a reference to opening the new accident and emergency department in Limerick regional hospital.  The accident and emergency department in that hospital is one of the busiest in the country.  It is frequently overcrowded and is not fit for purpose.</p><p>On many occasions, ambulances have queued outside the emergency department to take patients onto trolleys which are all occupied inside the hospital itself.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has given a commitment to open the accident and emergency department on 29 May, next Monday, and the hospital management has given a similar commitment.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that all the preparations have been made relating to funding, staff and the operational structures which will govern the accident and emergency department?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, this morning we heard the extremely disappointing news that manufacturing will cease at Waterford Stanley in October with the loss of 33 jobs.  There are 57 people employed in Waterford Stanley but the workforce will be reduced to 24.  Waterford Stanley's first cooker was produced in Waterford in 1936 and the Stanley brand name is synonymous with Waterford, as is Waterford Crystal.  I am delighted to see the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation beside the Taoiseach.  I call on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and on Enterprise Ireland to liaise immediately with the company and ensure the workers who will lose their jobs in October find new employment as a matter of urgency.  We cannot allow these workers to become long-term unemployed</p></speech>

Drogheda is the largest town in the country and has the population of a city without any of the perks.  It has, like other large towns across the State, been neglected by successive Governments for decades, and many of the buildings that would benefit from inclusion in the living city initiative are in dire need of refurbishment and regeneration.  The extension of the initiative would be of very little cost to the Government so I ask the Taoiseach to consider extending it to Drogheda.</p></speech>

The living city initiative is continually reviewed.  We have tried different things in the past 30 or 40 years and have offered various incentives to different locations.  There was tax relief, which entailed lines being drawn on different streets.  That created its own problems as smart accountants were able to get around the legislation and build developments that were never thought of, while areas outside the delineations suffered.  Many premises which are derelict and in need of repair are left that way by owners expecting a payday when the economic situation improves.</p><p>That question also needs to be looked at.  In the first instance, the local authority should prepare a programme justifying why the living city initiative should be extended to Drogheda.  It should also point out the initiatives it is taking to improve the lot, perspective and definition in the aforementioned town.  There should also be discussions with those who own derelict buildings.  The council have a responsibility in that regard and it is not good enough that such buildings in town centres are left for 20 years to rot, fall down and be a disgraceful aspect when they could be put to far better use.</p></speech>

Many people are now being blocked at a pre-planning stage because of designations in the county development plans.  There are areas of intense urban pressure, stronger areas and weaker areas.  There could be a young man in an area under intense urban pressure who would not be considered for planning permission if he wanted to buy a house next door to where he is currently living.  That matter has to be addressed.  The planning guidelines are currently discriminating against many people, especially local people who wish to build a house for themselves.  In Europe, it has been found that such discrimination is unfair and illegal.  Will the Government address the planning guidelines?  It is acting illegally in terms of the planning guidelines which it has given the local authorities.  That matter has to be addressed.  It has been highlighted by many local media outlets in recent days.  When will the Government address it?</p></speech>

Since February 2013, I have raised with successive Ministers for Health, Senator James Reilly, Deputy Varadkar and Deputy Harris, the issue that the last Government and the current one are in breach of two Labour Court recommendations whereby these workers are due to be paid four and a half weeks pay per annum in lieu of pension entitlements.  These are low-paid workers who are owed money by the State.  I have raised the issue by way of parliamentary question on numerous occasions.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recently said that the Government is unable to come to an arrangement for this payment under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  These are the lowest paid workers in the health sector and they are owed a paltry sum of a few hundred euro.  However, that sum is very important to them.  I ask the Taoiseach, in his last weeks in office, to take the bull by the horns on this issue I have been raising for more than four years and to pay these low-paid, front-line home help workers in the health service money the State owes them in lieu of pension entitlements.</p><p>I ask the Government to take Labour Court recommendations 19297 and 19299 very seriously.  The previous Government and the current Government have been ignoring my calls for four years.  Now is the time to do something about it and pay these workers what they are due.  </p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il had a similar Bill on the same issue but we reached agreement with the Minister for Housing, Planning ,Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, that we would defer the Bills for consultation.  In the subsequent six months, there has been no consultation whatsoever.  I have read the policy papers of Deputies Varadkar and Coveney.  Deputy Varadkar's streets are full of frapp&eacute; cappuccinos and cupcakes but contain precious little information on who is going to be taking Ireland forward other than Leo.  Deputy Coveney similarly covers place-making and good green stuff but again, he does not provide the slightest indication as to what will be the political reform to make happen all this place-making, to bring us forward and get everyone into the cupcakes and frapp&eacute; cappuccino territory.</p>  <p>  Has the Government discussed the development of a directly elected mayor for Dublin and how do we progress this in a collaborative way?

It is also clear that certain companies are now giving the Government the two fingers and are beginning to charge for black bins over a certain weight in spite of the agreement in place.

It took long enough to negotiate the programme.  One of the greatest success stories in that regard has been the work of ConnectIreland, which works as part of the Succeed in Ireland programme.  However, the draft terms of reference for an independent review of Succeed in Ireland on the departmental website today are deeply unsatisfactory.  Why is the IDA and the Department so determined to undermine the huge success of ConnectIreland and its work in bringing jobs to rural Ireland?  Is there a vendetta?  Is it a battle for control with the IDA?  ConnectIreland has had excellent success rates.  The IDA should be reined in.  The website is disgraceful.</p></speech>

The theory was that people working abroad for different companies, which were considering investing in Europe, would ask that the companies consider investing in Ireland.  If they did decide to invest in Ireland there would be a reward fee for the director to the country here, provided that the jobs were sustainable and that they actually became a reality.  It has worked reasonably well in small areas that would not be the focus of the IDA.  While it might provide four, ten or 20 jobs in those areas, they had the potential to grow.  There were discussions between ConnectIreland and the IDA.  There was the question of re-tendering contracts.  I cannot provide the up-to-date detail as of today but I will find out.  The plan was worth following.  It has produced a number of jobs, perhaps not as many as expected, but nonetheless it was important for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

It was also in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto that if we got into power we would do this.  Is legislation in place for this and what is the timescale for the erection of these cameras?  We have two motorways going through my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the M9 and the M7, and organised gangs are coming from Dublin in particular and are targeting businesses and robbing them.  In one case two weeks ago in Urlingford, a small village in north Kilkenny, a gang came from Dublin and robbed the safe.  They took the lot and were in and out in 30 minutes.  They got back onto the motorway and back to Dublin.  What is the status of this legislation?  The Garda needs all the help it can get and I ask the Government to take this on board as per the commitment it gave in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

Both know the knowledge transfer system for farmers is in absolute chaos.  It was supposed to be up and running on 31 May.  I welcome the fact that it has been put back to 31 July.  The reality is that the system has crashed time and time again.  I also understand that the online system for booking meetings with the Department has also crashed.  This is not the first time that this has happened with a Department.  The Department of Social Protection had the same issue with maternity benefit some weeks ago.  I am not sure what the Taoiseach can do about it in his last two weeks or what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine can do about it but we must get to the bottom of this.  What can be done to stop this happening?  It is creating difficulty for the farming community at present.</p></speech>

There seemed to be a lot of information given and it was indicated that the payment would be rolled out in 2018 at a cost of &euro;60 million.  There was a public consultation process which only finished at the end of March.  There has been very little information since then.  Can the Taoiseach commit to the roll-out of the new working family payment in 2018?  Is it intended to use the payment as a replacement for the family income supplement, FIS?  Can the Taoiseach indicate clearly what stage of the process this measure has reached?</p></speech>

It could have been written by Dame Barbara Cartland such is the level of fiction it contains.  The programme commits the Government to implementing new procedures to ensure more efficient and timely recruitment of nurses.  To be fair, the Government has set itself a target of recruiting 100 nurses each month.  It is failing to reach that target, however, and is lucky to get 34 nurses a month.  We now have a competition to be our next Taoiseach between the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar and Coveney.  Neither candidate has given any indication that he has a plan.  In his last few weeks in the role, can the Taoiseach send a message to nurses and health care professionals in respect of recruitment?  Is he in a position to say that the Government is going to do something different?  Clearly, what it is doing is not working.  Nurses do not want to work in the health service as it is currently constituted.  Has the Taoiseach something to say to them about how it is going to be different?  The two lads who are vying for his job have precious little to say to them.</p></speech>

The opportunity is there for nurses to work in Irish hospitals and in the Irish health system.  Hopefully, they will do so.  As the Deputy is aware, discussions are now under way at official level - to be followed by ministerial discussions - on the extension of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  I hope that a conclusion can be brought to those discussions before the end of June.</p></speech>

Part of this is a process which all Deputies come across, namely Garda vetting, which individuals who work with children through employment, sports organisations or whatever have to undergo.  There are huge delays in Garda vetting.  I spoke to the people in the bureau who do it and one of the reasons for the delay is duplication.  A person who goes to a school to teach music has to get Garda vetting.   If he goes to another school to teach the same music to similar children, he has to be vetted again.  If he also goes to a GAA club to train children, he has to be vetted yet again.  This continuous duplication of the process is a complete mess.  The people in the bureau say there is not a complete system or database and that is what is needed.  Will the Taoiseach commit to getting this situation resolved?  It is very frustrating for people, particularly those who are trying to get employment in the sector.</p></speech>

I could never really understand why a passport system is not available for those who, as the Deputy says, train children in one club and coach in another.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach, fair play to him, was instrumental in ensuring that IDA Ireland developed new advanced factories in both Sligo and Mayo.

I hope the facilities that have been committed to from Tralee to the Athlone and in the western region will be marketed by IDA Ireland and will attract interest from direct investors into the country.  Approximately 1,500 jobs are being created each week.  As broadband capacity and the infrastructure opportunity are rolled out, it makes it much more attractive for jobs to be created outside the greater Dublin region.  As the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has pointed out on a number of occasions, the Government's decision has been to invest in creating the vast majority of jobs outside the greater Dublin region in terms of IDA Ireland.  That approach is backed up by Enterprise Ireland's being able to expand many of the firms that export at the moment.  Deputy McLoughlin's local facility in Sligo is being presented and promoted by IDA Ireland and I hope that process will be successful soon.</p></speech>

This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade and it provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, which share deep historic ties and enjoy strong trading relations.  Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants.  Today, over 4.5 half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population &ndash; claim direct Irish ancestry.</p>  <p>  During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto and met a number of existing and potential new IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies.  These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  While in Montreal, I met Prime Minister Trudeau.  We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment into Europe.  We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland.  The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process.  Members will be aware of the part played by John de Chastelain in decommissioning terrorist arms in that process.</p>  <p>  Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community at which I met potential and current investors in Ireland.  I also visited the school of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met with members of the Irish diaspora.</p>  <p>  In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event and an event hosted by the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me with opportunities to meet current and potential investors in Ireland.  I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial in Toronto, which is a magnificent site .  I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell.</p>  <p>  My programme concluded with a meeting with members of the board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish diaspora and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada. </p>  <p>  This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada.  I expect relations will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, from 30 May to 2 June.</p></reply>

First, he has acknowledged that he discussed with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which we now call CETA.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, answered a parliamentary question on 9 May about the parliamentary ratification of CETA.  She said that progress on ratification has commenced in 43 national parliaments and regional assemblies throughout the EU and that it would commence in Ireland shortly.  When will those of us in this House have a chance to debate fully and determine assent or otherwise to CETA?</p>  <p>  It is agreed at EU level that the agreement would have provisional application until such time as it is formally ratified.  That is not a position that I object to but it would be useful to have formal approval or at least a debate in the House on the provisional impact of CETA in advance of formal ratification.  I am keen to know whether the Taoiseach agrees that we should have useful discussions on the matter.</p>  <p>  During the Taoiseach's visit the Canadian Prime Minister warmly praised the accepting of Syrian refugees.  Canada has been very good at that.  Unfortunately, our record is not so sterling.  Let us consider the situation here.  Ireland committed to taking 700 asylum seekers from the resettlement camps in Italy last year and a further 459 from Greece.  I understand that the Greek migrants have been accepted but that none have come from Italy because of the ongoing difficulty relating to accepting the vetting systems from the Italian authorities.  The European Commission has urged Ireland to resolve this matter.  How close are we to resolving it?  How many of the 2,600 people that we pledged to take have actually arrived in the country to date?</p></speech>

Actually, as Deputy Howlin is aware, Canadian views are very much in line with Irish views on the benefits of trade agreements and the benefits of properly used globalisation for jobs.  They are keen to have the agreement operate in the interests of both countries.</p>  <p>  Some 50% of foreign direct investment from Canada goes directly to Britain.  Since the United Kingdom is moving out of the European Union and the Single Market, this is clearly an opportunity for this business to thrive.</p>  <p>  I gather there are now flights from Montreal, Toronto and St. John's to Ireland on a weekly, if not daily, basis.  I think four airlines are coming in.  They are keen on that.</p>  <p>  The agreements provide a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies in Canada in financial software, telecommunications, digital technology, agricultural machinery, life sciences and medical devices.</p>  <p>  CETA was signed on 30 October 2016 in Brussels by representatives from Canada, EU and member states.  The EU and Canada have also agreed a legally binding agreement, a joint interpretative instrument, which has been added to CETA to provide further assurances in respect of public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.</p>  <p>  A number of steps remain to be taken on both sides before this becomes fully operational.  Meanwhile, aspects of CETA will be provisionally applied by both sides beginning, I hope, this summer.  The provisional application of the trade agreement is a standard process in agreements of this sort.  It allows those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to come into force, including reductions in tariffs on our exports, which will apply to 99% of exports.  However, the provisions of CETA relating to investment protection will be excluded from provisional application.</p>  <p>  The European Parliament voted in favour of the provisional application of CETA in February.  The process of ratification is now commencing in member states.  Canada is now finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for ratification.  I understand that Canadian Senate approval was secured on 11 May and the Bill now awaits royal assent.</p>  <p>  I spoke to Canadians about beef, which was an issue here with the Irish Farmers Association.  Canada is allowed 15,000 tonnes under the original agreement.  Canada finds this difficult to meet because most beef from Canada goes the other way &ndash; it goes west to Asia.  CETA increases that but it will be difficult for Canadians to meet that level.</p></speech>

CETA has been condemned even before it has been debated here.</p>  <p>  I remember when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I opened an Enterprise Ireland office in Toronto.  Why did we open an office there?  It was to get access and provide information and networking for Irish companies to sell their goods and services.</p>  <p>  The economy of Ireland depends on selling its goods and services abroad.  There are people in this House who believe that we should stop all of that and cut it at the knees.  That is the view from the anti-austerity people.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a negative view of free trade agreements too.  We seldom hear positive affirmation of the idea of free trade in this House or of the idea that, as a small island economy, we need to sell our goods and services abroad, including food, intellectual property, project management services and so on.  We are fantastic at software.  Many countries throughout the world are keen to access our software.  The same applies to pharmaceutical technology and so on.  If we go down the road of protectionism and try to put up shutters, then we will ruin the Irish economy in future.  There must be some resistance or balance in the debate in this House.</p>  <p>  That is why I am critical of the fact that a debate has not been scheduled.  It need not be a debate for approval; it could simply be an open debate on the merits of a free trade agreement with Canada, which shares the same standards, by and large, environmentally and in the food industry.  Across the board Canada has the same type of liberal open democratic economy and society that we enjoy.  Of course there is toing and froing and give and take in such agreements.  For God's sake, we should be urging the conclusion of this agreement between the European Union and Canada.  It will be to the betterment of Irish companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, but we never hear that.</p></speech>

I have been there many times and I have family there.</p><p>There are very deep links with people here, particularly among people in the North and particularly those who live in Toronto.  However, notwithstanding the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's protestations, there are concerns about the implications of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, especially among farmers, workers and small and medium indigenous companies.  The Government has ignored those and there has been no debate on these issues.  This is the place where we should have had this debate and I have been asking for one for some time.  The only vote in these Houses was in the Seanad, which called on the Government not to ratify the deal.  The European Court of Justice, which took the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, FTA, as a test case determined that these new agreements can only been concluded by the EU and member states acting together and by the state parliaments having a vote on them.  </p> <p> There needs to be a debate. The Government has signed up to this provisional application of the deal at EU level without any deference to the D&aacute;il.  We have been given legal opinion to the effect that a referendum would be required before the Government can sign the final agreement on CETA.  Does the Government have advice?  Has it sought a legal opinion from the Attorney General and what is the Taoiseach's view of this issue?  </p></speech>

We will have a debate on free trade with Canada in respect of the Deputy's request.  I will see that it happens.  It is a very good thing.  For the Deputy's information, the provisional application is a standard part of trade agreements and allows those parts of the agreement on which the EU has competence to proceed.  CETA provides for provisional application, as the process for ratification across all member states may take a number of years.  In Ireland's case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision, which is not what the Deputy was talking about there but a debate on the benefits of free trade.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has observed many times that we export Irish agricultural products to over 180 countries and that is where our strength is built, the Deputy rightly points out.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation supports the provisional application as it allows for Irish medium-sized enterprises to export tariff-free to Canada.</p>  <p>  Finally, I point out that 38,000 emigrants from Ireland - immigrants to Canada - went to Toronto in 1847, when the population of that city was only 20,000.  They were welcomed with open arms.  I want to commend Robert Kearns and his people on the wonderful memorial they have built on the shores of the lake there to those Irish emigrants.  They are now moving to commemorate the medics who worked with people from the Irish community, many of whom died from diseases such as typhoid and cholera.  This is an important debate which we will have.</p></speech>

At the time of the launch a number of short-term measures were announced to help the community address some of the immediate challenges facing it and these are mostly completed, having been progressed by the responsible Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  This has resulted in &euro;1 million invested in sports and youth projects in the area, &euro;700,000 spent on local community projects targeting children and youth, including some drug projects.  A further &euro;3 million has been spent on improvement works to the area, including roads, housing areas, parks and lighting and refurbishment of the Sean McDermott swimming pool.  Further investment will take place in response to the publication of Kieran Mulvey's independent report in February and the Government's agreement to implement his recommendations in full.  The first step has been the establishment in the local area of the programme implementation office with staff assigned from Dublin City Council.  In addition, the Secretary General of my Department established an oversight group last month to oversee preparatory work across a number of Departments.  The next step is for the ministerial task force, which I chair, to appoint an independent executive chairperson who will lead the work and engage with community structures and local residents.  That person will be based in a premises and office in the north inner city.</p></reply>

There was a shooting in broad daylight in my local petrol station in Clonshaugh recently.  There were 70 people in that garage at that time.  In Clontarf, with which the Taoiseach will be familiar, there is a permanent armed checkpoint on Castle Avenue, I presume it is manned by the emergency response unit, which is very unnerving for local residents.  Can the Taoiseach assure Members the Garda is making progress in bringing the feud to an end?  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach visited Scoil U&iacute; Chonaill recently.  His commitment to this project is well known and the work done by Kieran Mulvey is recognised as having been very productive but what will happen now?  Who will drive this project?  The Taoiseach will step down from his role in the next few weeks and while I wish him well in his retirement as Taoiseach, we need to drive this project.  I am not sure that the proposed structures for the report's implementation are adequate.  The Taoiseach should consider the establishment of a north inner city authority to address the challenges and champion the north inner city's social and economic regeneration.  We have the report.  Some progress has been made but we need to drive it forward and my fear is that when the Taoiseach retires, that will not happen.</p></speech>

However, the report was launched on 16 February in the Sheriff Hall.  Three months have elapsed in the meantime and we have to ask what we have seen in that time?  We know that it is not only the current Government which is to blame; it is successive Governments and their indifference and neglect, not to mention the austerity budgets and their adverse effects.  It is also fair to state that without the murders, violence and resulting headlines, we would not have had a Mulvey report and the indifference and neglect would have continued.  There are glaring absences in the report, particularly with regard to housing, drugs, new communities and mental health issues.  The North Inner City Community Coalition has produced its own report and there is a need to look at both and see how they might merge together.  I am asking three things: first, when will the chairperson be announced?  The second, which I have already brought to the Taoiseach's attention, is the need for community representation at all levels, not just one member on the highest level of the implementation team and we need to see the implementation structures at all levels.  Money is welcome but we all made the point at the outset that there was no point in throwing money at the area in the short term but must consider long-term solutions.  This is not merely about the north inner city, because drugs and violence are not common there.  This is a question of national relevance and if we get it right in the north inner city, it can be rolled out elsewhere.</p></speech>

The ministerial task force was launched with great fanfare and there was a lot of hope among citizens there that finally a Government was about to take their needs and concerns seriously.  We all know, as the Taoiseach acknowledged in his remarks, that the north inner city, like other working class districts in Dublin and other urban areas, has been deliberately neglected by successive Governments and victimised over the last few decades by vicious criminal gangs.  The report compiled by Kieran Mulvey, Creating a Brighter Future, has been ready since February but there has been no substantial progress or investment and no evidence of any meaningful effort by the Government to establish viable local structures to oversee the changes we all wish to see.  The Taoiseach said last month that the Government would act on the advice of the report.  Does that include the refurbishment of Rutland Street school as a community centre?  In February, he stated he would shortly appoint an independent executive chair to head up a number of implementation bodies.  As it is almost June and that still has not been done, when will this appointment be made?  He also said he intended to visit the area again.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in response to Teachta McDonald, said the Taoiseach will meet with the North Inner City Community Coalition.  Will the Taoiseach meet with the North Inner City Community Coalition, which is the parent body that represents the people in the area?  Will the Taoiseach say when he will do it?  Will he bring with him some properly funded proposals for implementation?</p></speech>

I acknowledged at the time, and since the Taoiseach took the initiative in the summer of last year, that there was a consensus in the House that we could use a model over a number of D&aacute;ileanna to invest, improve and transform an area that needed that level of focus and maybe potentially use the model elsewhere if it worked.  When I was back in the north inner city with Joe Costello two weeks ago, I met many of the local groups.  One of the concerns they have, as I said to the Taoiseach, is that the Taoiseach moving out of the office of Taoiseach will mean the focus and momentum will be gone.  The Taoiseach indicated to me the independent executive chair would be appointed.  Are we very close to that now?  Will it happen before the Taoiseach vacates his office?  What role does he see for the Department of the Taoiseach in the future in ensuring the very detailed Mulvey recommendations are put into effect?  Is there a commitment there?  A number of local Deputies, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, have an interest in the issue and I presume the Minister will commit funding in the short term but in the longer term, can we have some device that ensures the entire programme is safeguarded against future change of Government or Minister and that we will achieve what the House wants, a model redevelopment in this part of our national capital?</p></speech>

The Mulvey recommendations said to set up a north inner city programme implementation board, a north inner city programme office, a new community consultative forum and a local programme working group.  The programme implementation office has been established in the area and has commenced work on a number of actions.  An independent executive chairperson, referred to by Deputy Howlin and others, will have the lead responsibility for the programme implementation board.  I expect that person to be appointed very shortly and hopefully we can do it before I leave this seat.</p></speech>

Once appointed, arrangements for the remaining board to include community representation will be finalised.  A meeting of the community consultative forum will convene following appointment of the chair to ensure there is ongoing wider community participation and feedback on various aspects of the programme.  The Secretary General of my Department has established an oversight group to support the work of the ministerial task force and to ensure these actions are monitored and implemented.  That group held its first meeting on 6 April and discussed progress and a list of actions from the Mulvey report.  It is expected to meet again today.</p>  <p>  Some of the things that have happened are &euro;1 million was invested in sports and youth projects, a multi-use games pitch in Sheriff Street community centre, a fit-out of the new premises for Ballybough boxing club, improvement works to pitches at Sheriff Street youth club and Larkin Community College.  Small grants and equipment were distributed to about 40 local youth groups and sports clubs and a local GAA and soccer coaching programme was supported.  I was glad to see the Deputies out at Scoil U&iacute; Chonaill in Clontarf the other day.  A full-time local sports co-ordinator was employed to make the most of the local facilities and get people involved.  There was &euro;700,000 spent on community projects targeting children, including the successful Bally Mac Sheriff Halloween festival, local library and school based projects targeting reading and digital skills, the Brighter Futures restorative practice projects across two age groups in the area and funding for third level access programmes.  There were 15 local drugs projects supported and grants to support local arts projects and men's sheds community garden project, which were all very successful.  There was &euro;3 million spent on the physical improvement of Ballybough House and Courtney Place, Ballybough and road resurfacing works at Sean McDermott Street, Railway Street, Cumberland Street North, James Joyce Street, Beaver Street and Buckingham Street Upper to improve the physical aspect of the place.  There were improvement works in Mountjoy Square and Portland Place park and internal and external refurbishing of the Sean McDermott Street pool.</p>  <p>  I congratulate former chief superintendent Leahy who was appointed by the independent Policing Authority to be assistant commissioner.  He was a superb policeman, really on top of his job and I hope his successor will do the same.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the issue of gangland crime and the checkpoint.  It is unnerving but necessary, given the situation that has applied there for some time.  The Garda Commissioner is overseeing the operation of the Garda special crime task force to enhance the response to organised crime.  The task force has been in operation since July 2016, has made serious inroads and has a big success rate.  Operation Hybrid was established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in the area and address public concerns about community safety.  Operations are reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain that kind of impetus.  The Government has approved an extra &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist in a number of initiatives including concentrated policing which targets gang-related crime.  Obviously we will look at the question of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station being opened.  It is an iconic building and there is work to be done there.</p>  <p>  I will go down there on Monday with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to look at many of these projects.  Joe Costello and others are all welcome to turn up in the afternoon.</p></speech>

Community involvement is very important.  We will see it happens.  Deputy Adams raised some of the issues I have read out.  I will visit the area next Monday.  Deputy Howlin mentioned local groups.  The Secretary General of my Department is<i>in situ</i>now to oversee and monitor the implementation of the full programme.  The point the Deputy makes is about where we should be here.  This template should be transferable to other locations in this city and any other city so we can have all the community leadership come forward with their views and a response from a Government that listens.  To make this point in the wider context, if the banlieues of Paris or other places were inhabited by people the Government had no interest in for 20 years, it could not expect model citizens to come out of them.  That is where Government has to listen to all voices, including discordant ones, and deal with them.  That is the way the centre can always and will always hold.</p><p>The points made by Deputy Haughey, O'Sullivan, Adams and Howlin are all valid in this case.</p></speech>

The disruption of Brexit will be profound and it is not yet clear what the scale of the response will be from the Government or the European Union in terms of the facilitation of solidarity mechanisms which might enable us to help industries under pressure or help industries to transition as a result of Brexit.  In monetary terms, Brexit could be very significant for the country.  The Taoiseach mentioned yesterday that an economic paper is being finalised.  I accept there is a balance here and the Government wants to promote the country and its well-being but we cannot understate the scale of the challenge.  There is no point in telling people not to be so negative about Brexit and not to talk down the economy.  The reality is Brexit is a fundamental change to our economic model.  It is a once in a generation change that changes how we have been operating for 50 years.  It obviously depends on the trade component of the Brexit deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  It is about damage limitation.  Can the Taoiseach indicate what the current estimate is of how much trade may be undermined by Brexit?  Will he confirm which sectors will be worst hit?  There is ongoing coverage of Ireland bidding for EU agencies to locate here.  Is there any update on these bids?  Are the reports today true that the State may have to cover rent to land EU agencies?  Will the Taoiseach outline where we are in terms of that competitive bid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400021#T01400"><p>We all recognise that Brexit is the greatest threat facing the economies of this island and particularly the imposition of an economic border.  There was confirmation by Revenue at last week's meeting of the joint Oireachtas committee on finance that there will be significant customs checks, which flatly contradicts the Taoiseach's denial that it will happen.  Revenue told the committee at least 8% of the 2 million heavy goods vehicle journeys between North and South each year will need to be checked, including physical inspections.</p><p>This means that approximately 160,000 heavy goods vehicles will be subject to customs checks each year.  Will the Taoiseach update the D&aacute;il on the work taking place to prepare for customs checks and, in light of his denials that Border checkpoints or customs checks were being planned, perhaps set the record straight?  How many customs officials is it anticipated will be needed?  Has the Government estimated the likely cost of implementing European Union law in respect of border customs security?</p> <p> At the same meeting, an official from the Department of the Taoiseach confirmed that the Government has never raised designated status for the North with the European Union.  I have been asking the Taoiseach questions on this matter for a long time and he has always avoided confirming this.  The D&aacute;il, Seanad and Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have all endorsed the need for special designated status for the North.  The vast majority of people in the North voted for this status, or at least they voted to remain in the EU, and the majority of MLAs support it.  The Taoiseach's responsibility should be to defend this vote.  Will he start to do so?  Will he indicate when the Government's additional paper on the economic implications of Brexit will be published?</p></speech>

It is my understanding that, in determining the fiscal space available to the State, the Government decided to disregard the 2015 figures on gross domestic product, GDP.  While we happily took the additional corporate taxes generated in this period from the relocation of corporate profits to the island of Ireland, for some very odd reason that I genuinely do not understand the Department of Finance decided not to take advantage of the 2015 growth rate.  I understand the European Commission was happy to accept the 2015 figure, which would have given the State an additional &euro;7 billion of fiscal space.  This money is needed to invest in infrastructure.  Why arbitrarily reduce by &euro;7 billion the fiscal space available between now and 2021 by ignoring the 2015 growth figure?  This was a political choice that will impact on our capacity to invest in infrastructure at a time when, as the Taoiseach noted, money is cheap and available.</p>  <p> The leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is pushing for more public private partnerships, PPPs.  I argue for a cap on PPPs because they are the most expensive approach.  When the State can borrow money at very low interest rates, it does not make sense to have PPPs rather than direct investment, although PPPs make sense in some areas.  We must have a debate on the infrastructural needs of the country and how they should be funded.  I am puzzled by the arbitrary political decision, despite the views of the Commission, to lessen the capacity of the State to invest in infrastructure.</p></speech>

There is no denying that as this is a totally new situation.  When Article 50 was written, no one envisaged that a country would decide to leave the European Union.  This has happened, however.  In addition, the British Government, in respecting the wish of the electorate, has decided to remove the UK from the Single Market.  A changed situation arises in respect of the trading negotiations.</p>  <p>  It is true that we export 90% of what we produce.  Some elements involved in addressing this will be to have a much stronger concentration on the eurozone and arrange trade missions to sell the agricultural and food products we produce.  The agriculture sector is already under pressure.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is aware, currency fluctuations mean we are down &euro;500 million in six months.  Our response has been to provide low interest, longer-term loans and increase the capacity of Enterprise Ireland to further assist exporting companies.</p></speech>

The matter will go through the normal process and will come before the European Council for final decision in the autumn.  There are major implications and opportunities for whichever location is chosen.  Ireland has made a case for hosting both organisations and we will compete with many other countries.</p><p>Deputy Adams referred to customs controls.  The official who spoke at the joint committee last week was referring to hypothetical scenarios.  We have an agreement politically that there will be no return to the Border of the past.  Nobody wants the to have a situation such as that which applied at the Killeen crossing and right along the Border for years and which brought with it, as Deputy Adams is aware, sectarian violence and militarisation.  As I stated previously, if, arising from the Brexit discussions, tariffs are not applied to goods moving between the Republic and Britain or Britain and the rest of Europe, we will still have two different jurisdictions and a way will have to be found to deal with that.  What we agreed with the British Government and Mr. Michel Barnier, who addressed the D&aacute;il only a short time ago while standing next to where Deputy Adams is seated, was that the solution will have to be creative and imaginative.  The independent members of the Revenue Commissioners will say that they may well have a job to do here and will look at the different options.  However, the committee also agreed that it is not clear what will be the outcome.  What is clear is that there is a political <i>imprimatur </i>of no return to what we had in the past.  Deputy Adams knows the importance of that as well as I do.</p><p>Designated status is an issue I have always referred to in the sense of our particular and unique circumstances, which were outlined to the House by the chief negotiator on behalf of the European Union when he referred to our citizens, economy, jobs and relations with the United Kingdom, the protection of the common travel area, our place in Europe and the fact that we do not want to return to what we had before.  We unreservedly condemn the latest atrocity in Manchester.  I was glad to hear the First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, express the hope the other day that an Executive would be formed.  While there are political differences, it is important that the Executive faces in the direction of the future and we will be able to have the North-South Ministerial Council, the cross-Border agencies and the development of infrastructure into the North, which are very important for the future. </p><p>I will have to revert to Deputy Howlin with some detail on the matter he raised.  I do not want to lead him astray but I think the issue is related to the arrival in Ireland of a great deal of intellectual property from corporate firms, which caused a spike in the figures.</p></speech>

In addition, the Ministers for Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform must give their consent to the contractual terms and conditions of the director.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council, in advance of the expiry of the five-year term of office of the director, communicated to my Department in December its intention to reappoint the incumbent director and sought my consent for the procedures it proposed to use to make the appointment.  The council later brought to the attention of my Department an issue regarding the contractual arrangements and at one point rescinded its original decision to reappoint the director due to perceived potential contractual difficulties.  However, I consented to the procedures and my Department clarified the contractual terms, which provide for a fixed-term contract in the context of the continuation of a secondment arrangement.  Following its meeting on 8 May, the council offered a new contract to the director, the terms of which were agreed by my Department with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the reappointment of a chief executive or director of a public body for a second term is consistent with Government policy applying to public bodies generally.</p></speech>

Many newly qualified teachers will find it very difficult to comprehend how such a highly paid role can be automatically renewed without any public competition.  Newly qualified teachers are put through a rigorous interview process, so how can this be right?  Is it one law for some and another for others?</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has been tasked with the carrying out of important initiatives, such as the implementation of the fitness to teach legislation.  It requires the confidence, support and respect of its members.  Surely an act like this undermines all of that.  The Minister stated that he had given his consent, but does he approve of the automatic reappointment without a public competition?</p></speech>

This individual was chosen following an open and fair competition process.  There was not an automatic reappointment.  The board of the Teaching Council decided that it was its preference that this individual would continue to do the work that he was undertaking, and for good reason.  The director has undertaken a great deal of reforming work that is in train.</p>  <p>  The board's concern related to a legal question as to whether the appointment for a second term would give rise to a contract of indefinite duration, in other words, the individual would become permanent for all time.  That issue was required to be resolved.  The individual has been appointed for a second term, but that does not contain a commitment to continue his service beyond that term.</p>  <p>  It is often the case that when the board of a State body has confidence in a particularly good individual, it will reappointment him or her for fear of losing the individual.  That is the situation in this case.  The board recommended and we resolved the issue.</p></speech>

Surely to God that is a serious enough issue for the Minister to take into consideration.  It is also my understanding that several members of the board wanted the appointment to be open to public competition, yet it was not.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any difficulty in terms of the CEO's performance, but the process that was followed was not fair.  It does not seem right that such a process was in place and that someone could be reappointed automatically.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister investigate this matter and ensure the position is subject to public competition in future?  The chair stepped down and several members of the board expressed concerns about this issue.</p></speech>

It must make up its own mind about any office.  The board recommended in December that this individual be reappointed.  The concern that was brought to my attention did not relate to the board's wish to have an open competition, but its fear that a legal question would arise whereby an individual who was given a second term could then have an indefinite contract.  That was the issue that was sought to be resolved.  Following its resolution by my Department using precedent from other circumstances and designing a contract that would protect against that eventuality, the Teaching Council decided in December to proceed with its original decision, namely, to reappoint the director.  That was entirely fair and in accordance with proper procedure.  It is not a requirement that every time a post comes up, a person in position would be required to enter a fresh competition.  This individual was selected by competition in 2012 and the board wished to reappoint him.  The issue that needed to be resolved was resolved and the board has confirmed that position.</p></speech>

Apprenticeships are badly needed, so we must open them up more than has been the case to date.</p></speech>

The programme for Government commits to providing 31,000 apprenticeship places by 2020, and the Action Plan for Education states that we will enrol 50,000 people on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes in the period to 2020.  This represents more than a doubling of the 2016 activity.</p><p>The Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new sectors of the economy.  Following its first call for proposals in 2015, the council has been working closely with consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships.  Last year, we saw the first of these new programmes with the insurance practitioner apprenticeship, which launched in September, and the industrial electrical engineer apprenticeship, which will get under way in November.  Three further new programmes are registering apprentices and will commence in May and June of this year, two in the medical devices area and one in polymer processing.  A further ten programmes are expected to get under way later this year in various sectors, including hospitality, financial services and accountancy.</p><p>As well as developments in new apprenticeships, registrations in the craft trades are increasing as the employment and economic situation improves.  In 2016, there were 3,742 registrations, representing a significant recovery since the crash.  The upward trend continues this year, with registrations at the end of April of 1,585, which is almost double the corresponding period in 2014.  Registrations in the craft trades are predicted to grow to 5,587 over the period to 2020.</p><p>In January, we published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland which sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how the commitments set out in the programme for Government and the Action Plan for Education will be met.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The plan sets out a clear ten-step critical path for the development of an apprenticeship and an overall timeline of 12 to 15 months.  One of the key commitments for this year was the issuing of a second call for proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call.  The second call issued earlier this month, and it is now open to industry and education and training providers to submit proposals for new apprenticeship programmes in their sectors.  In conjunction with the second call, an information handbook has been produced for consortia that sets out in detail the ten-step critical path for the development of a new apprenticeship and also the key resources available to consortia to support them in the development process.  The handbook, along with other supporting material, is available on the new apprenticeship website, , which will be a key source of information for apprentices, employers and industry looking at the apprenticeship model as a means of meeting their skill needs.</p><p>My Department, its agencies and the Apprenticeship Council are working in close collaboration with the combined aim of delivering these targets.  Next month, curricula for five programmes will be considered for validation by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The Apprenticeship Council continues to work with consortia from the first call on developing their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships.  Recently, development funding has been approved for a further four programmes in the areas of retail practice, property services, engineering and ICT.  A further ten proposals will shortly submit detailed development plans to the council and, subject to approval, will progress to development.  Additional resources have been made available to agencies to support them in the expansion programme.</p><p>Arising from the first call, we have five programmes that are operational, 19 programmes that are at various stages of development and a further ten programmes that are about to move to development.  Much has been learned in the expansion project and I am confident that we now have a clear process with strong governance to allow for the efficient development and approval of new apprenticeships.  This will enable us to develop apprenticeships as an attractive and valued option for school leavers and other learners.</p></speech>

They are not yet seen as an alternative to third level for people who might want to do them.  Clearly, the new insurance practitioner apprenticeship is an alternative, given that it is a level 8 qualification - a degree, but one done in a different way.</p>  <p>  I hope that the Minister of State will support a suggestion of mine.  I do not see why he would not and I have referred the suggestion to the Ceann Comhairle.  The House of Commons in London has a scheme under which it has developed new apprenticeship programmes, for example, in office administration or even political communications.</p><p>I have suggested in a letter to the Ceann Comhairle that the Oireachtas would look at that, and I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for referring it to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Not only would that help us here in the Oireachtas but it would also change the perception of apprenticeships as it shows it is the sort of education that we in the House would want to have available.  It would also send out a wider message to employers.  I hope the Minister of State will support this and add his weight to it.  I believe it is a good idea.  There is already a precedent for this in London and I believe it would definitely open doors for the whole programme, apart from opening doors for people into the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I regularly meet companies that are interested in apprenticeships.  If we look at the basic apprenticeships we usually would have spoken about, such as for plasterers, bricklayers, carpenters and so on, it is interesting that we are now moving into apprenticeships for industrial electrical engineers, manufacturing technicians, polymer processing manufacturing technicians, engineers up to level 7, OEM technicians, telecoms field technicians, ICT network engineers, HGV drivers and property services apprentices.  There is a whole list that runs from commis chef to sous chef, craft butcher, executive chef, accounting technician and so on.</p>  <p>  All the time we are looking for ideas and proposals, whether they come from Deputies in the House, whose opinions I value, or from outside bodies that have an interest in creating apprenticeships.  The Deputy's proposal is certainly worth considering and I would value a meeting with him, perhaps next week, to discuss it further.  If there is merit in it, which there appears to be, having listened to the Deputy, we may very well be able to take it on board.</p></speech>

As I said, the precedent is already there in the House of Commons, so it should be easily transferable.  The Oireachtas already has a relationship with DIT, which I believe is being developed separately by the Ceann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  I have one query.  All the Government's targets for apprenticeships are national targets and they require money.  Does the Minister of State believe he will have the money?  Can he say that these targets will be met because the funding will be available for them, or is some more radical option needed to try to divert some of the resources from the Higher Education Authority into training and apprenticeships and to move the student bodies around?  While I am not proposing that, it is an idea some people have and it is certainly a model of education in other countries in western Europe.</p></speech>

On the first question, there is already a new call out for apprenticeships and perhaps the valuable proposal the Deputy makes will come into that.  Given the previous position of apprenticeships, which had reduced in number to approximately 3,670, there has been phenomenal development across the spectrum in the past two to three years.  As to whether we will reach the target and whether the money is available, as I said, a call is out.  We have seen the value of investing in apprenticeships and the take-up has been phenomenal.  There is no reason we would not want that to continue.</p></speech>

Degrees have been changed so that the student is not just doing a primary degree to qualify as a pharmacist but, effectively, has to do the final year as a master's degree.  While it is laudable that people are as highly qualified as possible, what was previously done as part of a primary degree is now being done as part of a masters degree and there are fees associated with that.  The worry is that this is a way of generating extra income for the universities because of the severe crisis in third level funding.</p></reply>

The education and training of pharmacists to first registration is specified in EU legislation, at Article 44 of Directive 2005/36/EC, and consists of a five-year education and training programme which must include a minimum of six months' practical training under the supervision of a pharmacist.  In Ireland, the Pharmacy Act 2007 conferred responsibility on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the pharmacy regulator, with respect to pharmacy education and training.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is an independent statutory body and is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland.  This includes developing standards and policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.</p>  <p>  The changes in the degree programme structure arise from the recommendations of the pharmacy education and accreditation reviews project, and implementation has been overseen by the National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation, which includes representatives of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Department of Health, the Higher Education Authority, community, hospital and industry pharmacists, and patient, student and international expertise.</p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland rules were signed by the Minister for Health in 2014.  These rules underpin the implementation of the new five-year fully integrated masters degree programme in pharmacy, which evolved from significant review of the previous training pathway and international best practice assessment in this area.  They also gave effect to new accreditation standards that were developed by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and place the core competency framework for pharmacists on a statutory footing.  In that context, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the changes to the pharmacy programmes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400024#W00900"><p>Far be it for me to intervene in any way with pharmacy programmes, but the fact is a pharmacy degree was always five years, or it was when I was at college, and those who were studying it had to stay on longer than other students.  The worry is that this and other examples are being used as a back door way of getting more money into the system.  It is a severe worry because there is a severe shortage of money in the sector, although there are others who beg to differ and we look forward to watching RTE's "Prime Time Investigates" tomorrow night.</p>  <p>  This is certainly a way to get more money into the system and that is one objective.  However, is it acceptable to do that?  The five-year requirement in the European directive was already being complied with.  It is not as if there is an extra year.  It was always five years, or it certainly was at Trinity College.  Now, however, part of that is a masters year.  Is it an unsanctioned fee increase through the back door?  That is the question pharmacy students are asking us.  It is simply adding to the cost and the debt burden they have and, most worryingly, it may be putting people off going into pharmacy who are from backgrounds where they are turned off by the cost.  That is wrong and our education system should not be about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400024#W01000"><p>As the original reply explained, this was put together by a group which looked at international best practice and decided that the new programme structure should be different.  It has set out dispersed shadow placement in year two and a practice-based approach in years three, four and five, rather than a focus on the final year.  These are designed to be workplace-based learning experiences overseen by education providers through the mechanism of shared service facilities, the affiliation of pharmacy practice and experiential learning.  This is based on an assessment of what is best practice in training and developing qualified pharmacists by those who are best placed to deal with the issue.</p>  <p>  When the Deputy raised the question, I was surprised that, because of the limit of four years for free fees for the undergraduate piece, this five-year programme automatically resulted in a masters year.  However, it was not put together as an income earning mechanism but was put together in good faith by those who were regulating the sector.  I will ask my officials to look at the model whereby this particular type of qualification requires someone in their final year to pay fees.  It would obviously raise wider issues in terms of student support and so on.  I will ask my officials to examine it in view of the concern the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

I know there are a small minority of teaching qualifications where one can qualify as part of the primary degree, and the student both studies the subject and does the teacher training at the same time.  Most students traditionally did a higher diploma in education, although a masters degree is now required.  While it is great that our young professionals are very highly educated, the truth is that this is adding massively to the cost of their education at a time when their wages are likely to be lower than the wages their predecessors could earn when they graduated.  It is something we need to be conscious of because we are putting many burdens on the young people of this country and certain sectors are perhaps not willing to share the burden.  We need to be careful.  This is part of a wider debate on fees, student loans and so on, and we need to watch what burdens we are putting on young people.  In my view, we are adding a heavy burden and it is certainly worth looking at again.</p></speech>

However, we feel we need to have professional regulatory bodies looking at the standards that we all reach - the Teaching Council in the case of education and, obviously, this pharmaceutical body in the case of pharmacists.  When we get a recommendation from people in whose competence we place faith, we have to take that seriously.  I understand that there is this unintended consequence for people participating, but that is something we need to consider rather than saying that we try to dilute what is thought to be best practice in these areas.  We need to ensure that we are up to world practice.</p></speech>

These data are applied uniformly to all schools in a fair and objective way to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.</p>  <p>  An update of the DEIS identification process will take place later this year using 2016-2017 school data combined with small-area statistics based on the 2016 national census.</p>  <p>  A communication for issue to all schools is currently being prepared.  This will provide information on the identification model, with details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage, the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up-to-date school information to my Department.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p>  <p>  Ongoing development work provided for in the DEIS plan 2017 includes consideration of a more tailored system of resource allocation, where levels of disadvantage identified and resources allocated match the identified needs of individual schools.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about fairness; there is no element of fairness.  I called on the Minister to conduct an immediate review of the criteria under which schools are assessed for inclusion in DEIS.  I spoke after five schools in Tipperary town along with the Holy Trinity school in Fethard were ruled out.  The Minister said that there would be another scheme, but we have waited too long for this scheme to come.  The fact that there is no application or appeal process is a farce.  There must be some guidelines in that area.  We know the benefit.  The Minister has named the criteria and the schools in Tipperary town meet all of them.  The five schools came together, thinking they were doing the right thing, to make a joint approach not to discriminate one from the others and the whole lot were left out without any explanation.</p>  <p>  The Minister's recent announcement is the clearest indication yet that the criteria used to select schools for DEIS status are bordering on useless and the Department of Education and Skills itself has acknowledged this.  There is something very serious here.  The fact that there is no application process means they are left in limbo.  Will we have to wait another eight years for another review?  There is no clarity in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

A very detailed analysis of this was done before this system was introduced.  The indicators that are being used, demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates, are found to be very closely associated with educational disadvantage, which is why they were chosen.  They are also the objective criteria used by the CSO in drawing up the HP deprivation index.  This is a selection based on a robust analysis of how to identify schools with high concentrations of disadvantage.  They have been applied uniformly in all cases.</p>  <p>  I would be the first to acknowledge that many schools did not qualify on this occasion.  Only 79 schools qualified for an uplift on this occasion and 30 had their status changed, giving 109 in total.  That is out of 4,000 schools whose status we could change on this occasion.  It would be my ambition over time to extend this.  As I said in the reply, we are now reviewing all the schools using the new census data so that schools that might have seen a deterioration or a greater indication of deprivation will be reviewed later this year.  Through that review process we continually look at schools and assess their need for support in this way.</p></speech>

In Fethard the Holy Trinity national school has been left out.  However, in the same town with the same demographics and other indicators the Minister mentioned, the secondary school has it.  The feeder school with the young children does not.  Therefore, that does not stand up.  The five schools in Tipperary town came together.  On all the indicators the Minister mentioned, unemployment, social class, single parent rate, Traveller children - you name it - we ticked all the boxes and yet the whole lot of them were totally excluded.  I do not want to do down Tipperary town because it has very spirited people and great community activity.  However, it has no industry and very few services.  Successive Governments have forgotten about it.  We clearly made a very passionate case.</p>  <p>  How is the Minister saying this will continually be reviewed?  How will the five schools in Tipperary town participate in that review?  If there is no application process, how can they engage with the Department?  Any Department inspector who might come in there to carry out a review would accept that the schools are doing a good job under the circumstances, but they badly need DEIS status.  The same applies in Fethard where the secondary school has it and the only primary school in the town does not.  Something is clearly rotten with that system.  It is not functioning.</p></speech>

The reality is that 2% of schools were selected for DEIS categorisation, meaning that 98% were not selected.  Deputies can always point to some school in that 98% that could represent disadvantage and I have no doubt that they do so in good faith.  Only 2% of schools were uplifted, but these were selected on the highest level of disadvantage based on the objective criteria I read out earlier.  This was not a phoney operation; it was done very objectively-----</p></speech>

This is absolutely looking at the individual circumstances of each school.  Every child is looked at under this review.  Therefore, it is a fair and objective system.</p></speech>

My Department invests over &euro;300 million annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools, enabling: 63% of students to attend mainstream schools; 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary; and post-primary schools and 11% to attend special schools.</p>  <p>  Enrolment in an ASD special class is only considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he or she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day, even with appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  Students enrolling in ASD special classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals, including, for example, a psychologist, a speech and language therapist or a psychiatrist, stating that the child has autism and has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting.  The report should also set out the reasons this is the case.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible for establishing special classes to meet the needs of this cohort of students. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet demand.</p><p>Since 2012 the NCSE has increased the number of ASD special classes by more than 100% from 413 in 2012 to 888 currently.<br/><br/>The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish an additional 162 ASD special classes for the 2017-18 school year which will bring the total number available across the country to 1,050.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that there has been a significant increase in the number of ASD special classes since 2011 but the ratio of primary to secondary has remained fairly constant.  We know that when children transfer from primary to secondary school it can be quite a traumatic time as it is a difficult transition for many students to make.  In the case of students on the autism spectrum, it is all the harder for them, and if students are moving from a special class in primary school to a mainstream class in secondary school it is hugely challenging.  They are moving from a situation where there is a 6:1 ratio at primary level to perhaps 20:1 or greater than that at secondary level.  There is a real mismatch between primary and secondary and for that reason will the Minister insist on the provision of additional classes at secondary level so that students can make that transition?</p></speech>

I do not make the decision as to whether a special class is needed.  The figures show that the number of ASD units is growing more rapidly at second level than at primary level, albeit as the Deputy said that there are more units at primary level at present.  There will be 281 units this coming September at second level.  It is the NCSE that advises on the issue.  I am told by it that in general it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet demand.  As the Deputy is aware the NCSE has published a review of policy in relation to autism generally and it has drawn attention to practice at second level, which needs to be followed.  It is the advice of the NCSE that informs the choices that are made each year as to where and when ASD units are opened.</p></speech>

On the one hand the Minister is saying there is sufficient provision but on the other hand he is saying there will be an 18% increase next year.  Either there is sufficient provision or there is not.  It is quite clear that there is not at the moment.  While SENOs make recommendations, unfortunately, second level schools are not required to open ASD special classes.  It is a voluntary arrangement.  The Minister must tackle that problem because, for example, in Cork in the past two years every single secondary school was asked if it would consider opening an ASD special class and all bar one refused to do that.  There a need to have some kind of system in place that requires second level schools to open special classes.  It cannot be left as a voluntary arrangement because it is clear that students are then left with a situation where the provision is not adequate.  Will the Minister consider taking a new approach to the issue?</p></speech>

It reports that there is a good and improving range of placement options, including appropriate settings both at preschool, primary and second level.  The NCSE is looking at the need to evolve each year.  As the Deputy correctly said, it has recommended this year that 169 additional special classes would be provided.  Relatively speaking, one is seeing stability in the mainstream in that approximately 63% remain in mainstream classes but more children are being accommodated in special classes, which in previous times might have been in special schools.  The NCSE is seeing the evolution of a changed education environment and that is to be welcomed but it is for it to advise me not for me to decide that the solution is one thing or another.  The NCSE has the experts in the field.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall raised another issue as to whether the D&aacute;il should consider giving the NCSE additional legislative authority.  I am certainly open to considering that and it is an issue other Deputies have raised in the House, but that will have to be discussed at committee because there are issues around compulsion and the model has been based on working with schools.  Sometimes schools say they do not have the infrastructure or this or that and the NCSE works with them to resolve those issues.  We need to thrash that out at committee and I am happy to do so.</p></speech>

This building is a listed structure that requires extensive refurbishment to make its facilities fit for modern school purposes.  In that regard, a significant financial investment will be required and that has to be considered within the overall available capital envelope.  I am not, therefore, in a position at this stage to indicate when the refurbishment works will be undertaken.  My Department will be in further contact with the patron when any further update is available.</p>  <p>  In the interim period, my Department will be making arrangements to extend the school's current lease on its temporary premises until June 2018.</p></reply>

The school community is now facing into its fourth school year at the Glebe golf club on the Kildalkey Road, where it is currently housed, despite the divestment process having been concluded last year.  The parents were told the refurbishment would take 14 weeks but as the Minister outlined no work has been carried out and the board of management has exhausted all efforts in trying to seek clarification in respect of the situation.</p>  <p>  The parents understand that the section of the Department that approves the funding is now refusing to provide the money for the refurbishment as it believes it is too costly and it is in an internal disagreement with the section in the Department which sanctioned the old convent school building.  It would have made more sense to check the cost and feasibility of the location, which is beside three other schools, before sanctioning it as a new school.</p>  <p>  The current location is hindering enrolment numbers, which is restricting staff growth because the golf club is located on a country road, the Kildalkey Road, and there are no footpaths or infrastructure.  The situation is limiting the school choice for many parents in Trim, which as the Minister is aware is a growing town and people are looking for choices such as Educate Together.  The school will reach its full capacity by next year.  What the Minister has outlined is very disappointing given the context of what has been provided in information to the parents who were told it would be a 14-week refurbishment period.</p></speech>

I understand the Deputy's concern if the current location is not satisfactory for parents.  However, my Department will have to be satisfied that the investment represents the best value for money and is the best solution for parents and children in the longer term.  I will bring the concern raised by the Deputy to the attention of the officials in terms of the school's progress being hampered in its current location.  I know Trim well but I do not know the precise status of the individual buildings concerned and what the level of refurbishment is that is a cause of concern.  However, I will ask that the situation be reviewed in light of what the Deputy has said.</p></speech>

The school is in a golf club on the Kildalkey Road, which as he knows is a country road.  There are no footpaths and the school is located a couple of miles from the town.  The school will have 60 pupils this September.</p>  <p>  I am pleased the Minister will bring the matter to the attention of the officials because one of the biggest bugbears has been the lack of communication between the Department and Trim Educate Together national school about what has been happening, especially as we were advised that it would be a 14-week refurbishment period.</p>  <p>  My office was in contact with the principal, Karen Reilly, yesterday and she said that if a parent of a prospective pupil asks how long the school will be in the temporary accommodation and when it will be able to move into the new permanent school that she would not be able to answer the question.  The school was under the impression as well that funding would be provided through the redress scheme for the development of the school site.  The bottom line is that there is a campus available in the town that is ready to go and which provides the necessary campus facilities for a growing town centre.</p><p>That is where the people are, that is where the town centre is, and that is where Trim Educate Together wants to be.  Being out a country road a couple of miles in a golf club is not a satisfactory situation for the parents, the children and the staff who want to educate their children in the Trim Educate Together school.  There may be a bit of a misunderstanding with the redress scheme.  This was offered by a religious order as part of its contribution to the general redress scheme. It does not mean that a redress fund is available to upgrade the school.  It was a contribution by the order to meet some of the commitments it made to contribute to the cost of redress.  The works involved in this particular location appear to be more complex than was first envisaged.  I will, however, bring the concern to the attention of my officials and I can see the point the Deputy is making.</p></speech>

This compares with 16% in 2012-13.  That is a small improvement.</p><p>Below average progression rates continue in the fields of construction and related services, computer science and engineering, with variation between sectors and institutions.  There is, however, some improvement reported in progression rates for computer science, with rates increasing from 80% to 84%.  Institutes of technology rates have increased from 74% to 80% compared with universities from 85% to 88%.  This would indicate that the funding made available for retention measures is having a positive impact.</p><p>One of the key objectives my Department has set for higher education is to improve equity of access and student pathways.  The HEA works with the institutes to improve recruitment and to tackle early dropout.  There are a wide range of initiatives that can contribute to better recruitment and retention. These include access programmes, surveys of student experiences, extra tuition in areas of known difficulty, and improvements in first year experience.</p><p>The HEA is working to ensure good practice in this area is disseminated and implemented across all institutions and disciplines.  The HEA has produced a discussion paper on the factors that contribute to student success.  A working group has been established, which is chaired by the HEA, and it comprises representatives from across the higher education sector.  The intention is to identify the type of strategies and measures that have been shown to be successful in different institutional contexts.  The national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning is facilitating a focused scoping exercise to inform the activities of the working group.  The scoping exercise is being chaired by the Union of Students of Ireland.  This will ensure the student voice is central to this process.  It is expected that the working group will produce its report by the end of 2017.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The research shows that there are certain factors consistently associated with non-progression in courses.  These include prior educational attainment and parental occupation.  Colleges are encouraged to develop access and progress in their strategies.  A role can also be played by broadening the choice of education and training paths available to students, and my ambition is that 20% of pupils would have the option of apprenticeships or traineeships in the coming years.</p></reply>

It is important we address this issue as soon as possible.  The fact the non-progression rate stands at 15% is extremely worrying.  The Minister has pointed out that there was improvement in some courses, but there are courses such as construction and level 6 and level 7 courses that still have an unacceptably high rate of non-progression.  The Minister is aware that we have had meetings of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills where many academics from the institutes of technology clearly outlined the impact of the lack of funding in the sector.  Many of the academics spoke of how they were going out of their way to support students, disadvantaged students and students with disabilities and special needs and how they were finding it extremely difficult to do so.  This issue needs urgent action.  I would like to see concrete actions and timeframes.  The Minister has said there will be a range of measures introduced, but we need a timeframe.  Those academics are at the end of their tether in the institutes of technology and it is unfair to subject staff to that sort of pressure.</p></speech>

This is about looking at the individual students, asking why they drop out and seeing what has gone wrong.  Some of the access programmes have been very successful because they support students right through their transition and perhaps offer help with supplementary studies.  Sometimes mathematics might be a problem, for example, for students whose maths preparation was not adequate for their chosen course.</p>  <p>  It is not just a question of resources right across the sector; it is about policies being designed.  Obviously, each institution is independent and the HEA, as I outlined in the reply, is looking to see what the best practice is and is seeking to mainstream that.  From the overall framework we set targets for each institution, and reducing drop-out rates is a key target.  We review the performance of institutions on this measure.  This is why the HEA has taken this new initiative to try to improve the practice within each institution.  It is hoped this will be crowned with success.  It can be seen, across the various qualifications, that perhaps some people make mistakes in their choices.  This goes back to Deputy Thomas Byrne's comments earlier that some students may pick a science subject when they may have been better off choosing an apprenticeship route.  That scenario might have been better for all concerned rather than high placement rates.  We need to work across the spectrum to reduce the figures of non-progression.</p></speech>

Would the Minister not agree, however, that this is due to the cuts in guidance counsellors and the impact of that measure?  Those cuts were at second and third level.  The Minister has rightly pointed this out and I am glad he has acknowledged it.  That is the reason.</p>  <p>  I know the HEA is trying to improve practice, but I believe that the Action Plan for Education is quite ambiguous on the issue.  It commits to no more than establishing a working group and identifying measures for consideration.  Perhaps the Minister could give an update on the progress of the working group.  How many meetings has it had?  Will there be a report and - a key point - when will it be published?  It is not good enough to simply identify measures.  We need a clear commitment that action will be taken.  We all acknowledge that there are serious problems around non-progression.  It may be a good start to commit to the establishment of apprenticeships as identified by the Apprenticeship Council.  We know there are skills gaps, as the Joint Committee on Education and Skills heard last week.  It is my understanding that only three proposals have been implemented from the 85 proposals that were identified in 2015.  The Action Plan for Education promised us ten new apprenticeship programmes to commence at the end of 2016.  Clearly this is not the case.  Will the Minister commit to providing the funding that is so badly needed?  Will the Minister commit to ensuring the new apprenticeships come on stream for September 2017?</p></speech>

With regard to guidance counselling, 66% of the guidance provision will be back in place by this coming September.  It is hoped this will equip young people to make better choices.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has outlined the ambition to treble the number of places on apprenticeships and traineeships over the next four years.  This would represent about 20% of the cohort which would have the option of going to an apprenticeship or a traineeship.  This would be a dramatic change in the range of options available to young people.  Deputy Nolan is right that we also need to look at the role of industry as well as the role of the education sector, and this is why building links between education and industry is very important.  We could bring to bear much more information about what jobs are really like in modern enterprise sectors today and we could give young people access to that information during transition year and at other opportunities.  One of the things I am hoping to work through the regional fora is getting enterprise more actively involved in that practical guidance.</p></speech>

To deliver on my ambition to be the best, we have to improve information and complaint procedures for parents and students, particularly in relation to costs.</p>  <p>  I want to give parents a strong voice in ensuring costs are always kept to a minimum.  My Department recently published circular 32/2017, which details the measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs.  The publication of this circular was one of the actions outlined in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019.</p>  <p>  Schools have to do everything possible to keep costs down for parents, including the use of generic items, sew-on or iron-on crests and making sure that various elements of the uniform can be purchased in multiple stores.  In the Action Plan for Education I have committed to the restoration of capitation payments.  In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost-effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment.</p>  <p>  Full transparency in the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.</p><p>The parent and student charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how voluntary contributions are used.  This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the school admissions Bill, which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment and the commencement of fitness to teach, which, for the first time, will allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching Council.</p></reply>

I welcome that it is acknowledged.  However, I am concerned about the lack of detail in the circular.  I wonder whether the Minister's approach in this regard is the right one.  For example, capitation in schools has been already cut by 11% and it is wrong to link capitation to schools' efforts to reduce back-to-school costs.  It is critically important that capitation is restored to schools as soon as possible.  I was disappointed that provision was not made for this in the last budget.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that schools will have a different rate of capitation, which will cause confusion.  This will also introduce an element of inconsistency in the funding model for schools.  Will schools lose out on funding if school costs rise and what model will be used to allocate the funding?  There are a lot of unanswered questions in respect of this circular.  Can the Minister confirm that all schools will have their full capitation rates restored as a matter of priority - an issue I have also raised with the Minister on the education committee - and can he set out a timeframe for the restoration of capitation because schools are struggling to pay running costs?</p></speech>

Each year, the Irish League of Credit Unions outlines the pressure on parents in terms of school costs.  Surveys carried out by my Department have shown that the principles I have put into this keen cost approach are ones that parents generally support.  The type of issues we will be looking at in terms of whether a school is compliant include whether a school is providing for generic choice for school uniforms and other items; whether the items are available in various stores; whether the school operates a book rental scheme and whether, if it has an exclusive agreement with a provider, it is tendered regularly.  These are fairly clear issues on which we can make an assessment of whether a school is making a reasonable contribution towards keeping costs down for parents.  It is perfectly reasonable that schools that are making the effort would be given a premium in terms of support from the State.  It is a partnership and that approach is one that not only asks everyone to do this, which is important, but also provides an incentive for schools that make a real effort.</p></speech>

I welcome the acknowledgement that back-to-school costs is an issue but I do not agree with his approach to link it to school capitation.  I think that is very unfair.  Schools have managed to do more with less money and this is not the right approach.  I am still unclear as to how the Department will implement this proposal.  Will schools be expected to report to the Department on an annual basis in respect of school costs?  How will the Department collect data on school costs on an annual basis?  In my view, the type of approach being taken will only create problems.  What happens in cases where schools do not have the resources to implement a school book rental scheme, for example, due to cuts in middle management posts?  Will these schools be penalised further?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister accept that additional resources need to be provided to schools to enable them to meet the aspiration of a truly free education system and will he implement the full recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee report on tackling back-to-school costs, which was published in 2013 and remains sitting on a shelf?  Can the Minister set out a timeframe for the implementation of the Oireachtas report on tackling back-to-school costs?</p></speech>

We are also introducing a parent and student charter and we are giving parents more say in the decisions that schools make.  We are trying to reach a situation whereby everyone feels it is in the interests of the school and the parent group to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum in order that parents do not have this additional burden.  We have yet to work out the details of how we assess compliance, how we measure contribution and the impact on capitation but the principle that we need to bring down costs is broadly supported across the House.</p>  <p>  In regard to book rental, we provide support to schools in respect of book rental schemes.  Most schools operate a book rental scheme but we want to ensure that every school does so.  We are introducing practical measures that will bring about change.  This will take time to reach its full benefit but it is a move in the right direction.  I welcome the Deputy's support.  I will look at the Oireachtas report to see if contains any additional initiatives that we should be considering.</p></speech>

Under the terms of my Department's student grant scheme, grant assistance is available to eligible students attending approved third level courses in approved institutions.  An approved course is a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration or a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.  In addition, to qualify for grant assistance, an applicant must satisfy the prescribed conditions of the scheme, including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. </p>  <p>  Students from this State who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses at higher national diploma level or higher, which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of the student grant scheme.  The student grant scheme is not available to students from this State who are attending PLC equivalent courses outside of the State, such as the specific programme referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

This needs to be examined by the Department.  Approximately 2,400 students from Donegal are taking courses in the North West Regional College in Derry.  This access to third level education is important to them.  While students undertaking a higher national diploma at the North West Regional College can access the student grant scheme, students on the level 5 courses cannot.  The purpose of the question is to ask the Minister to put this matter on the Department's agenda, with a view to allowing students taking level 5 courses in the North West Regional College to access SUSI grant supports.</p></speech>

I understand that all countries adopt a similar approach.  Supports for higher education programmes, but not PLC-type programmes, is the consistent practice across most member states of the EU.  If one introduces a scheme that extends support to one EU country, one is under obligation to provide a similar level of support to other EU countries.  There are a number of problems in regard to what the Deputy is proposing, including what might be expected to be a small extension proving to be a much wider extension because the rules have to be applied consistently across all citizens who have the right to free movement and so on.  That is the type of practical obstacle that would arise.  Also, the range of PLC is pretty thoroughly covered within the colleges here such that there is a full range of choice available within this jurisdiction.</p></speech>

A different situation pertains in Ireland, taking into account the island of Ireland, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  It is not sufficient to say that a range of courses is provided in the South because if that were the case, there would not be 2,400 students taking equivalency courses in the North West Regional College.  These courses lead to QQI equivalency qualifications and there are particular circumstances pertaining to Border areas to which consideration should be given.  I ask that the Minister give serious consideration to this matter in light of the serious difficulties being experienced by students in Border areas in accessing third level education and getting a start on the educational attainment route, which is evident from the number of students travelling to Derry to access courses because they cannot do so in Donegal.</p></speech>

There is a <i>quid pro quo</i>for any extension in this respect and it is not as simple as deciding to pick a country or college and extending support to that place because of its geographic convenience.  This suggestion would need to be examined carefully before we could consider it as it would raise an expectation under free movement rules in the EU.  When one extends something to another national one does not exclude others.  I will, however, ask my officials to look at the matter afresh.</p></speech>

When this process has been completed, I receive a detailed memorandum with recommendations for the establishment of new schools.  Once I have approved the recommendations, an announcement is issued advising the details of where the new schools will be required.</p><p>In order to determine who will operate the school, a separate patronage process is subsequently commenced and I receive a memorandum advising on the details of the process, when it should commence and the closing date for applications.  Once approved, a ministerial announcement is issued inviting patron bodies and prospective patrons to apply.</p><p>When the assessment of patronage applications has been completed by the forward planning section, a report is then sent to the independent new schools establishment group, NSEG, with detailed analysis of each area.  The NSEG reviews the report and submits its observations and recommendations to me.  On this basis, I make the final decision on patronage of the new schools.  Depending on the issues to be addressed in the course of an overall process, I will seek updates or meet with the relevant section as required.</p><p>The process is similar for major building works.  The demographic need is established using the various CSO, departmental and local authority input on demographic trends and projects are chosen to achieve the best fit for emerging needs in an economic manner.  A list of major projects, covering a multi-annual programme, is then drawn up.</p></reply>

A concrete example of where there needs to be more oversight and communication between the Minister's office and the forward planning section is Ballinteer Educate Together national school, which was announced as a primary school in 2012.  A deal was negotiated between the Department and St. Tiernan's community school to house the school temporarily until it received planning permission for a permanent home.  St. Tiernan's agreed because it was promised a PE hall but, five years later, there is no permanent home for Ballinteer Educate Together and no PE hall for St. Tiernan's.</p>  <p>  It is the manner in which Ballinteer Educate Together school is learning about its future which is of the greatest concern.  In November last year the principal, staff and parents learned of the Department's plans to move the school to the Notre Dame campus via a tweet.  That is unacceptable.  Last month, parents from Ballinteer heard by word of mouth from other people that a Gaelscoil would now be moving into the junior school at Notre Dame.  Despite the fact that only 27 school days are left until the summer break and despite repeatedly requesting the layout of classrooms, Ballinteer Educate Together has not been guided through exactly how the move will work or whether it will happen in June, July or August, and it has not been afforded a visit to the new campus by the Department.  To compound the departmental communications fiasco, when the principal recently rang to seek clarity, she was told the forward planning section was under pressure planning for other schools.  It is not good enough and I appeal to the Minister to communicate with the forward planning section so that clarity can be provided.</p></speech>

It is very difficult for traditional parish schools because the budget for new school buildings for large primary schools with 1,000 pupils, or secondary schools with even more pupils, is between &euro;5 million and &euro;10 million.  The task of managing the budget falls to a voluntary part-time board and although I find the attitude of many officials positive there is enormous confusion in the Department, causing stress to school boards, principals and parents.  We are still recovering from the construction collapse because lots of schools have lost various technical teams or had to replace them.  The Department, particularly the Minister's own office, does not seem to be able to address these issues.</p></speech>

I am not fully briefed on Ballinteer but my recollection of previous discussions in the House is that the site chosen was refused planning permission by the local authority, which was confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Attempts to resolve it resulted in another refusal and an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There has been particular difficulty in getting resolution to an access problem on the chosen site.  I do not know why that occurred and any planning process can run into difficulties.</p>  <p>  For managing these projects we have a patronage model and individual patrons run schools and bring forward proposals, for which there is a process within my Department.  We are managing it pretty efficiently and we spend all the money we get.  We built 22,000 school places last year but, with a budget of that scale with up to &euro;20 million for individual projects, we have to plan our resources and release them in accordance with the budget schedules we have to meet with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There can be hold-ups in the system, which ensure the spending flow is in accordance with the available resources, and the building unit has developed its approach over time.  Nevertheless, I am open to looking at ways in which it can be improved.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to keep schools informed of progress.  Is he aware of the problems making progress with new builds?  Is this lack of communication happening throughout the country?  Is the forward planning department vastly underresourced and does the Minister need to prioritise funding for the section?  Dublin Rathdown is a constituency which will soon not have enough schools to meet its needs.  How is the Department planning for the future needs of schools and children?  The lack of vision in the Department is worrying.</p>  <p>  The issues also affect another school in my constituency, Our Lady's Grove, where a large portion of the land has been put up for sale.  I appreciate that the land is private land being sold by private organisations but the Department should seek to protect the lands at whatever cost, whether that be through purchase or seeking a long-term lease.  I ask the Minister to keep communication open with these schools and to do what he can to protect our schools, our open spaces and our children's education.</p></speech>

When a site unexpectedly becomes available the Department moves to acquire it, as happened in the case of Notre Dame, so that it would be in a position to facilitate schools in a new site.</p><p>The Department is seeking to respond flexibly to a very rapidly changing environment.  The construction of a school building does not automatically run on schedule every time, as Deputy Martin saw in regard to the Ballinteer Educate Together school.  I am happy to consider any suggestions on this issue.  The system is tried and tested and delivers high-quality buildings relatively cost-effectively.  It is impressive that it is meeting the huge demand caused by the pressure of new pupils on the system.  However, I am always open to improvements and will ask for an examination of the processes of the building unit to ascertain whether practical improvements can be made.</p></speech>

As part of the Action Plan for Education, &euro;36.5 million has been committed to the expansion of higher education in 2017 and there is a commitment to grow further in the years ahead.  The Department is also consulting on an employer-Exchequer mechanism to support the effort to meet skills gaps.  To promote lifelong learning in the workplace and provide for employee development, the further education and training authority, SOLAS, is preparing an employee development policy framework due to be published in 2017.</p>  <p>  The recently-published Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 sets out targets to increase new enrolments on apprenticeships and traineeships from the current level of fewer than 6,500 to 14,000 by 2020.  Following the first call for proposals, several new apprenticeships have begun and more are to be launched later in 2017.  The good news is that a second call for proposals for new apprenticeships was issued on 8 May 2017.</p>  <p>  The requirement to provide for Ireland's future skills needs is considered in the determination of funding allocations through the service level planning process in the further education and training sector and the system performance framework at higher education level.  I, along with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, this week launched Springboard 2017, which will provide 6,471 higher education places in areas of identified skills needs.  This year, the eligibility criteria have been expanded to include homemakers and those in employment who wish to upskill or reskill in specific high-demand skills areas such as biopharma and med tech.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy's question is very relevant.  We have identified relevant needs and meetings are taking place.  Appropriate structures are in place for 2017.</p></reply>

To what degree does he and his Department continue to identify the likely skills requirements over the next five years?  Which areas have been identified as most vulnerable in terms of our ability to meet employers' requirements for necessary skills?  I ask that the skills considered include computer technology, which is becoming ever more important.  The IT sector needs to be catered for in the area of skills likely to come available and in regard to job creation.  The job creation efforts of all Departments will encounter great difficulty unless the skills are available.  I seek clarification on those issues.</p></speech>

To help foster stronger links between employers and the education and training sector, the Department of Education and Skills has established a network of nine regional skills fora, each with a forum manager.  The fora have been established to align with wider Government policy initiatives on regional economic development, including the regional action plan for jobs.  Indications are that the RSF are having a positive impact at regional level by bringing together key stakeholders to develop swift responses to emerging needs and to gather better data of the needs of enterprise and employers in the region.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second question on computing skills, we have issued a second call for new apprenticeships.  In my earlier reply to Question No. 25 tabled by Deputy Thomas Byrne, I detailed some skills and apprenticeships that we have at present such as ICT network engineer and ICT software developer at level 6 and manufacturing and ICT engineering, which is level 7, as well as engineering service management accounting technicians.  There also is a level 6 apprenticeship in IFS financial services.</p></speech>

He is allocating 300 classroom hours, rising to 400, to the wellness programme at junior cycle.  However, this will replace many existing classes and will reduce the amount of time that can be devoted to science and languages.  People are concerned by that.  It was reported at Christmas time that these were to be hours devoted to mental health but the reality is somewhat different.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the time allocated for the well-being programme, which is a minimum of 300 hours over three years from 2017, increasing to 400 hours from 2020, will not negatively impact on the time available for other subjects such as science and languages.  This is because well-being is built on a number of pillars, which include the currently-offered subjects of civic, social and political education, CSPE, physical education, PE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE.  These three existing curriculum inputs contribute 275 hours of the 300 hours that schools will be required to allocate to well-being.  The extra 25 hours amounts to about 8 hours, or 12 40-minute classes, per year.  It is important to note that well-being is an area of learning, not a subject, and students will learn about it through a wide range of curricular subjects and through the provision of whole-school activities.  There therefore will be no requirement for schools to find an additional 100 hours from within the timetable.  Most schools will reduce the number of subjects undertaken by students to reduce curriculum overload, as advised in the junior cycle framework and in Departmental circulars.  This will also allow increased flexibility to schools with regard to time allocation.</p></speech>

Coding was a buzzword in 2016 and this year well-being is becoming a buzzword.  The follow-up is not being provided.  There has been extremely limited follow-up to coding provision.</p><p>The Minister is dressing up PE and the old civic, social and political education, CSPE, and taking hours from other academic subjects to provide these well-being classes.  They have never been more necessary.  However, there is something slightly underhand in this.  It is part of the solution to the severe mental health crisis that exists in society, but the Department is not being honest about it.  A report at Christmas of an interview given by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, described the classes as mental health hours.  That is not what it is.  PE is a large part of this, and the Minister needs to come clean and explain what schools are supposed to do and when they are to do it.</p></speech>

There will be a plan developed in each school.  Supports are being provided to principals to design this plan in an integrated way.  I have met people from a number of schools in various parts of the country and there is a great belief that this is a vitally important programme.  There is guidance on well-being workshops which will be delivered by guidance councillors.  They are going to be a part of this process.  There is the possibility of healthy eating weeks being provided in schools, which will be an integrated programme and involve not just those subject areas but perhaps home economics and other areas.  The assessment is that developing student resilience and their capacity to cope in areas where they are much more challenged is important, and this well-being programme is going beyond the existing subject areas to provide a whole-school support to pupils.  It is the right direction in which to go.</p></speech>

It brought in a first aid programme which is now going to be rolled out in the well-being programme.  That illustrated to me that there was nothing really there for well-being and that they were actively looking for good ideas.  They got a good idea in the first aid programme in St. Kieran's community school.</p>  <p>  There are officials in the Department of Education and Skills who are working really hard, but I worry that the direction is not coming from the Minister.  The direction changes with the wind.  We have had coding, we have well-being and we will probably hear about modern languages in a few weeks or there will be a science, technology and mathematics, STEM, plan as the latest big idea.  However, it is all being mashed into one because there is no extra space for this.  Something is going to suffer, and I do not believe the Minister has been open and clear about that.</p></speech>

This was developed after much thought.  Extensive consultation went into developing the well-being programme.  It was identified by the stakeholders as an important element.  Extensive planning has gone into this.  Not only are we restoring guidance counselling and guidance teachers, who will be very important to this, we are also expanding the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, programme and we have developed supports and materials that will be part of this programme.  There is continuing professional development, CPD, on well-being.  There are modules on mental health, gender and sexual orientation, child protection and anti-bullying.  Materials are being developed and workshops are being put in place in order that schools can integrate this into their whole-school approach.  No one doubts that young people need this level of support in school.  The school cannot solve all the problems, but having that level of support within schools is a positive and beneficial thing for education.  It impinges on all subjects.  We are going in the right direction.</p></speech>

Indeed, it was as a result of acting upon one of these that the particular issue of the foundations came to light.  These are now being integrated into the accounts of these institutions.  That is progressing, and many of the colleges have already done so and others are in the course of doing so.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department and the HEA's ongoing work to develop, in co-operation with the higher education sector, a robust system for good governance and accountability in the sector, it was agreed that a programme of rolling reviews would be set up which would cover specific elements of governance.  This process involved setting a centralised procurement framework to deliver the reviews, the aim of which is to evaluate the effectiveness of governance in organisations against stated policy, best practice and national and international standards.  My Department agreed with the HEA that the first rolling review of governance compliance would be on procurement.  This review was undertaken in 2016.  As a follow-up to the review and to increase awareness of the need to comply with national procurement guidelines, the HEA, together with Education Procurement Services, EPS, organised a higher education procurement summit.</p>  <p>  It has been agreed that the next rolling review will be carried out on non-compliance of payments, including any payments to staff at higher education institutions.  The process of tendering for this review is under way in the HEA.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s overall intention is to standardise its approach to governance compliance across the education sector, taking into account the diverse nature of education sectoral bodies and having regard to the core standards of governance as articulated in the 2016 code.  In developing this approach, the Department acknowledges governance codes do not override existing statutory requirements such as the Companies Act, ethics legislation and other obligations imposed by the specific statutory provisions relating to the body itself and any other relevant legislation.</p></speech>

The public are going to be genuinely scandalised when they find out the extent of what has been happening in terms of the money in these accounts, which are essentially off the balance sheets of their parent institution.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the question of salaries.  Will he tell us if it is true that in some institutions numbers of staff are being paid over and above their public salaries and that in some cases these payments run into tens of thousands?  It may be that the institutions have good arguments for this, but the fact is there is no accountability for it.  At a time when educational resources are scarce, everyone is pleased to see universities fund-raising.  However, they need to be accountable for the fund-raising.  The Minister is being quite evasive about this.</p></speech>

We have, as the Deputy knows, given institutions of education considerable autonomy.  They have to use that autonomy carefully.  They are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General who has, as he as done in other public institutions, revealed cases of bad practice.  Those are being addressed.  Going beyond that, we have outlined a specific programme of rolling reviews that are now in place to enhance the governance.  Besides the annual reviews of governance which we receive, we are undertaking cross-institution reviews and focusing on areas where there have been particular concerns.  Non-compliance of payments is a particular example where there is now a review in place.  We are taking a very proactive approach to this.</p>  <p>  On the specifics of the foundations and bringing them on balance sheet, we have been working with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Many of the institutions have now regularised their accounts and others are in the course of doing so to make sure these foundations are properly reported.  Many institutions have funding sources other than just the State.  That is how these developed.  They have been commendable sources of funding, but they do need to be accounted for in a proper way in order that we can see transparency.  This is an issue the Comptroller and Auditor General has identified and it is being addressed.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, was not available today or tomorrow.  There are to be meetings with the community and voluntary sectors in respect of their concerns about the new strategy, which have been brought to her attention.  As she is dealing with those concerns, it is opportune that I can highlight the issues today and put them on the D&aacute;il record.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne in this area.  There is a need for urgency on the part of the Government in respect of the new strategy.  It must show that it is really committed when it comes to addiction.  It was in Dublin Central, in the north inner city, that heroin appeared first in the late 1970s and the 1980s.  The late Tony Gregory played a central role in the community response to its emergence.  The north inner city led the way in taking an inter-agency approach to drugs through the local drugs task forces.  Under that approach, statutory representatives from justice, including probation services and the Garda, the HSE, education, social protection including F&Aacute;S and community employment schemes and the local authority were all at the same table as community and voluntary sector representatives.  The projects which work directly with those in addiction are in the voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  When it works, that model is the best approach.  It works when there is real commitment on the part of all the participants.  The problem is that recent years have seen a slow erosion of State support and interest.  For the new strategy, the Government must ensure that all the relevant Departments and agencies are active along with the voluntary and community sectors.  Progress is being made at present, for example, in respect of medically supervised injecting rooms, tablet regulation - although that took a long time - the work of the Garda in tracking the proceeds of crime at local gang level and in opening the debate on decriminalisation.  However, the new strategy has to prioritise actions targeting the communities most affected.  The evidence and statistics identify those communities; they are the communities of poverty, educational disadvantage and unemployment, which suffer serious drug intimidation.</p>  <p>  We need to re-examine the use of the terms "prevention" and "education".  I think the terms "intervention" and "awareness" are more relevant today, especially if the new strategy supports the programmes the community and youth organisations are carrying out in this area.  Those programmes could be expanded into schools and into Youthreach.  There is a need for programmes that will develop the critical thinking abilities of young people.</p>  <p>  The young people's facilities and services fund was a highly significant tool in the prevention and education arm of the strategy and it is illogical to discontinue it without a viable alternative.  Its focus was those young people most affected in areas of economic and social disadvantage.  For most of the years, the fund had regular monitoring to ensure the money went where it was supposed to go.</p>  <p>  The new strategy also needs a clear implementation structure, timeframes for the various aims and objectives and clear roles for all of the players, statutory, voluntary and community.  The necessary resources must be provided to really make a difference.  Timely access to treatment for those in addiction is needed.  The new strategy must also be clear and unequivocal in addressing alcohol.  There are agreed recommendations in the substance misuse strategy.  It needs to consider seriously specific communities such as the Traveller community, ethnic and new communities and the LGBT community.  The voices of drug users must also be included in improving and supporting services.</p>  <p>  Will the new strategy be brought to Cabinet before the summer recess?  With the change in Taoiseach and a possible Cabinet reshuffle, where will the strategy stand? </p></speech>

I agree that we need to treat the matter with absolute urgency and assure the Deputy of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne's commitment to it.  As the Deputy is aware, a steering committee chaired by John Carr, former secretary general of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, was established in December 2015 to provide advice and guidance on the development of a new national drugs strategy, to take effect from 2017.  The steering committee has spent almost 18 months developing the new policy.  The process involved an extensive and comprehensive public consultation; a rapid review of the 2009 to 2016 strategy; the development of strategic actions through four key focus groups and a systematic review of international evidence on drugs interventions by the Health Research Board.  I understand that a meeting to sign off on the final report of the steering committee will take place tomorrow, as the Deputy mentioned.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the steering committee to deal with any outstanding issues in the context of finalising the report.  However, I can outline in general terms the key issues which the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, believes will be addressed at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting.  Regarding alcohol, my understanding is that the new policy will provide an integrated public health approach to substance misuse, which includes alcohol and illegal drugs.  I am advised that the new policy will incorporate key actions from the national substance misuse strategy and provide a range of new actions, which will take account of other Government policies and strategies that address the risk factors for substance misuse.  It is also expected that the new strategy will build on work undertaken by drug and alcohol task forces to raise awareness of alcohol-related harm within the community.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the new strategy will contain a specific objective aimed at building the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem.  This objective will also focus on communities affected by gang-related crime and the menace of drug-related intimidation, which the Deputy has raised.  I am aware that some people living in these communities may be afraid to report drug-related intimidation due to fears of reprisals.  For this reason, encouraging people to report drug-related intimidation by strengthening the existing reporting frameworks will be an important aspect of the new strategy.</p>  <p>  Maintaining the focus on services for at-risk young people will also be important in order that they can avail of opportunities to participate constructively in community life.  Finally, robust national structures will be needed to provide leadership and direction to ensure the effective implementation of the new strategy.  All sectors will need to play their part in making the new structures successful, as no single Department or agency can solve these problems on its own.  Measuring the collective input of all concerned and improving the performance of the different partners over the lifetime of the strategy will be supported through a new performance measurement system.</p>  <p>  I understand the steering committee is expected to submit its final report on the new strategy to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, shortly.  The next stage will be to bring the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on the new drugs strategy to Government, with a view to launching the policy before the end of the summer.</p></speech>

I note the response is very general.  While we will need to see the specifics, the most important thing is that the community and voluntary sectors will be able to sign off on it tomorrow.  The community drug projects play a vital role with some really innovative programmes.  They respond to needs as they are presented and were not getting the role they should have been given in the strategy.  The evidence is that they are successful in supporting those continuing in addiction and those who are in recovery.  Many of those projects are delivering in very difficult circumstances and are being swamped by paperwork.  They are on the edge all the time when it comes to funding.  I would be interested to learn what are the specific actions in respect of drug-related intimidation because the new strategy needs substantial actions to address this problem.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the Recovery Academy of Ireland to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, previously.  It is innovative and encouraging and is keeping people in recovery.  Its latest move is pop-up recovery caf&eacute;s, which are a great idea.  I met One Step Clinic recently.  It is looking for a pilot programme into the naltrexone implant, which is non-addictive, cost effective and very useful in coping with addiction.</p>  <p>  I think more than 3,000 submissions were made on the new strategy.  I submitted one myself on prevention and education.  I do not think anybody even got an acknowledgement that his or her submission had been received.  I hope the submissions will be included in an annexe of the new strategy.  The fact that so many people made submissions shows the level of concern, and they should have been acknowledged.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, is working on the gambling aspect.  I stress that we need to look at addiction in a holistic way and in its entirety.  Alcohol had been left out of the drugs strategy for so long and the same is true of gambling.</p></speech>

I will check why they were not acknowledged.  In respect of the community groups and in particular the drug and alcohol task forces, I know myself how important they are.  In Meath and Louth we have a community group that works together and a drug and alcohol task force.  I know some of the members personally and am aware of the sheer commitment that is there.  They come from various strands of our society and that is why it works well.</p><p>I have spoken to the Minister of State with responsibility for this.  She is absolutely committed to ensuring that they are happy with the strategy, that they have their say and that there is no sign-off until everyone is satisfied.  The only way this strategy will work is if there is co-operation, if people work together and if everyone who has done the work to date is happy with how things move forward.</p> <p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has made several suggestions.  Work is ongoing and there will be a presentation tomorrow.  Everything will be taken on board by the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of the cost of private ambulances being used to transport public patients in the midlands area.  This is an issue of serious concern.  I will outline why I believe it should be investigated.</p>  <p>  When we look at our health service, we can see clearly that it is failing miserably.  Are we wasting resources in some areas?  That is the overarching point I want to make.  This issue has been brought to my attention and I am seeking clarity from the Minister of State.  Recently, I submitted several parliamentary questions to the Minister.  I have them before me.  I was shocked by the figures, which are most concerning.  They show that &euro;4 million was spent by the Dublin Midlands hospital group for transportation by private ambulance operators in 2016 alone.  The cost relating to the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, at &euro;1.91 million, accounts for almost half of the total amount paid in 2016.</p>  <p>  According to correspondence from the HSE, the requirement for private ambulance use arises from the transfer of non-urgent public patients for various clinical reasons.  The examples given include transfers between hospitals, transfers between residential and acute settings and transfers for diagnostic tests at other hospitals.  The figures show that over &euro;25 million has been spent on private ambulances to transport HSE patents since 2012.  That is a matter of concern.  For some reason, this figure increased dramatically during the period in question.  In 2012, the figure was under &euro;4 million, but it jumped to almost &euro;6.5 million in 2015 and 2016.  At a time when our health service is bursting at the seams, we need to question whether this is the best use of resources.  We need to challenge the options being used and deployed.</p>  <p>  Those of us who live in Offaly know only too well the impact of cuts to the health budget.  The full capacity protocol was implemented 230 times last year at the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  It is meant to be used only in cases of emergency.  This was the third highest figure in the State.  We continue to have ongoing problems with patients on trolleys and the cancellation of elective surgery as a result of the crisis in the accident and emergency department.  One patient on a trolley is one too many.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State explain why the figures for private ambulance operators have increased so significantly during the past four years?  Can she explain in particular why the hospital in Tullamore accounts for such a high proportion of the spend?  The figure is &euro;1.91 million for Tullamore, the highest in the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  Can the Minister of State outline any plans there are to reduce this spend and invest in the capacity of the public ambulance service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400033#FF00700"><p>I wish to pass on the apologies of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who cannot be here.  I thank Deputy Nolan for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to inform the House of the position relating to it.</p>  <p>  The main role of the National Ambulance Service is to respond to emergency 999 or 112 calls, as the Deputy knows.  On average, the National Ambulance Service responds to 21,500 emergency calls per month.  There is, of course, a significant requirement for transfers of non-urgent patients for various clinical reasons outlined, including transfers between hospitals, transfers between residential and acute settings and transfers for diagnostic tests at other hospitals.  The National Ambulance Service provides such inter-hospital transfers through the intermediate care service.  By providing this service for lower acuity hospital transfers, emergency ambulances are freed up for the more urgent calls.  On average, the National Ambulance Service undertakes 3,800 inter-hospital transfers per month.</p>  <p>  In the context of the continued increase in demand for emergency ambulance services in recent years, there is a need to avail of private ambulance services to secure additional capacity for such patient transfers where required.  To this end, the HSE has put in place arrangements under a framework agreement that provides for the utilisation of private ambulance providers.  In circumstances where providers included in the agreement are not in a position to provide the service required hospitals are permitted to seek patient transport services from other providers recognised by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  The reality is that there is ongoing need for hospitals to have the flexibility to be able to access private ambulance services where necessary and appropriate.  However, the Deputy may be interested to note that the HSE has commissioned a review of public and private ambulance service provision.  The purpose is to assess the costs of both services, ascertain the appropriate use of those services and clearly define the parameters for use of public and private providers.</p>  <p>  Intermediate care services for the north Leinster area, which encompasses the former midlands area, operate from the Mullingar, Cavan, Cherry Orchard, Castleblayney and Ardee bases.  On average, the service based at Mullingar undertakes 41 routine inter-hospital calls per month.  Emergency ambulances in the midlands area undertake a similar number of journeys monthly.  Where additional services are required, hospitals may directly request private ambulance services.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years.  This ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services and the National Ambulance Service capacity review, which was published last year.  The review examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.</p>  <p>  In 2017, an additional sum of &euro;3.6 million has been made available to the National Ambulance Service.  This includes &euro;1 million for new fund developments.  Development funding will be used to increase the number of paramedics and intermediate care operatives in line with the capacity review recommendations.</p>  <p>  There is always a need for the public and private sectors to work together to be able to cater for gaps in the system and improvements we are trying to make.  Again, the increased number of people accessing and in need of our services will automatically result in increased demand in the public and private sectors.  That is possibly another reason why the numbers are increasing.</p></speech>

I have a serious concern that the increased use of private ambulances for HSE patients is an outworking of the policy of dynamic deployment.  That policy is failing miserably and is putting ambulance staff under pressure and patients at risk.  Given the reduced availability of public ambulances, we are now in a position where we need to rely on the services of private ambulance operators.  There are serious concerns in respect of the dynamic deployment policy.  Ambulance drivers have outlined these clearly to me.  They are concerned that patients are being put at risk.  This is putting them in an awkward position and placing them under considerable stress.</p>  <p>  Is the use of private ambulances an outworking of this policy?  I believe it is.  The Minister of State referenced a review of the system.  When will this review of ambulance operations take place?  As someone who is concerned about my constituency, I am calling for the review to take place as soon as possible.  Will the Minister of State outline the procedure for tendering and procurement?  What measures are in place to ensure value for money when private ambulances are used?  That is the crucial point.  We could have a situation whereby money is being wasted and whereby it could be put into another sector of the health service where it is badly needed.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised some valid points.  Patient safety should be first and foremost in everything we are doing.  It is important to note the fact that the HSE has commissioned a review.  I am afraid I do not have the exact details of when it will begin but I can certainly get them for the Deputy.  It will look at the service provision, assess the costs of the services, examine the appropriate use of the services and clearly define the parameters for the use of public and private providers.  It will look at all the areas of concern raised by Deputy Nolan.  I will ask the Minister to come back to Deputy Nolan with the timeframe, an outline of when this will take place and how people can be part of it.</p></speech>

In the west, commonage comprises shares in the commonage, unlike the collops in the east, and part of this is on private land.  Let us accept one thing at the beginning and we need go no further on it.  Anyone who purposely burned their land is ineligible - end of story.  However, where a farmer is a shareholder in a commonage and someone else started a fire which damaged that farmer's land, does the farmer have to take it out of his payment scheme application, despite him having no hand, act or part in the burning and not acting illegally in any way?  If that farmer takes it out and then makes a case that he should have been allowed to leave it in, since it was a <i>force majeure </i>case, will the Department put it back in?  On the other hand, if a farmer leaves it in, the Department decides the land should not have been left in because it did not become green enough, fast enough, the Department comes after the farmer on the basis the land was not eligible, and the farmer claims <i>force majeure </i>on the basis that he had no hand, act or part in it and it was beyond his or her control that the land was burned, will the Department not penalise the farmer?<br/><br/>The regulation states to the effect that an exception may arise where a farmer can clearly show that they had nothing to do with the burning of the land in question.  It is generally much harder to prove that one did not do a thing than that one did do a thing, so it is very hard for a farmer to prove that he did not burn land or start a fire.  I am asking a straight question because I think we need straight answers.  In the event of a farmer submitting evidence to the Department that there is no ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into any allegation of him burning their land, that he has not been charged with such or convicted of such in the year 2017, is that sufficient evidence for the Department that, as stated in the regulation, the person had nothing to do with the burning of the land in question?<br/><br/>We need clarity because between now and whatever the last date is for amending maps, farmers are being asked to make an incredibly difficult decision in that they do not know how the Department will adjudicate this.  Do farmers take the land out of the application and make a case to put it back in again, which is very unlikely because if farmers do that, the Department will tell them they took it out, or do they leave it in and say they will fight the Department on the grounds that they had nothing to do with the burning and an exception to this may arise?  Since we are only talking about people who did not light fires, does it arise in these cases and are they cleared when they can show, by producing evidence, that they had nothing to do with starting the fire?  This is the clarity that farmers deserve because we cannot play hide-and-go-seek with them and leave them in a position where they do not know the correct decision to take.  Do they take the land out of their applications and try to put it back in, which is a nonsense because I know if the land is out, the Department will tell farmers they will not get it in again because they took it out, or do farmers leave the land in and fight the Department on the basis that, according to the Department's own words, it will make an exception if the farmers have nothing to do with setting the fire?  This is the burning questions in Connemara at the moment.</p></speech>

These fires have resulted in significant damage to substantial areas of agricultural and forestry land, and significant expenditure has been incurred by the various authorities in firefighting and control efforts.  I am deeply concerned about the impact of these illegal fires across a wide range of areas, including the damage to agricultural land and valuable forestry assets, the loss of important forestry and wildlife habitats, and the serious risk posed to life, homes and property.  We cannot not tolerate such irresponsible acts.  Under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 it is an offence to burn, from 1 March to 31 August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated.  Individuals who are found to have burned vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which deals with one of the specific questions.  My Department will provide any support required to these parties to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Act.</p>  <p>  As I have stated, the burning of agricultural and forestry land during the closed period is illegal.  This is clearly outlined in the terms and conditions for the basic payment scheme which issues to all applicants annually.  The Department has commenced a comprehensive investigation of the recent incidences of illegal burning using all available technology, including satellite imagery.  This investigation involves complex analysis of imagery from a range of resources worldwide to determine accurately the specific locations of lands subject to such illegal burning and also the extent of the area impacted by the burning.  Where necessary and to assist the investigation process, such burnt land may be inspected by officials from my Department.  The investigation is ongoing and will take some weeks to complete.  It would be premature at this stage to speculate as to the actual area involved or the specific number of applicants under the area-based schemes affected.  However, the House can be assured that the necessary resources within my Department will be deployed to complete this investigation as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  On the matter of illegally burnt agricultural and eligible forestry land being eligible under the basic payment scheme and other area-based schemes, the Department&rsquo;s guide to land eligibility clearly states that land which is burned is not eligible as it is not in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation and therefore not eligible for the basic payment and other area-based schemes.  The EU regulations governing these schemes prescribe that land being submitted for payment must be in an eligible state.  All applicants under the basic payment scheme and other area-based schemes who have submitted their 2017 applications to my Department should review their applications and identify if their application includes land which has been burned in the closed period and consider removing this land from their application. The withdrawal of such land from their application can be undertaken by using the Department's online facility or by downloading an amendment form from the Department&rsquo;s website and posting it to the Department&rsquo;s office in Portlaoise.  There are specific issues around GLAS and cross-compliance which I can return to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400034#GG01000"><p>We are going around in circles.  Unfortunately, most of the Minister of State's response could have been left out.  In my question, I discounted those who illegally burnt land.  They are ineligible; there is no question.  The Minister of State read from a script, the first page and a half of which was irrelevant.  The issue is where a farmer did not burn his land and had no hand, act or part in it, but where he is in a commonage, part of which was burnt.  Let us throw away the script for a while and make decisions here.  The Minister of State, as a hill farmer, knows that he has to make day-to-day practical decisions, and the kind of vague language here is not helping us.</p><p>The first question is if I take land out of the application now, do I take it that a case cannot be made to put it back in again because I have taken it out?  From the Minister of State's knowledge of how the Department operates, am I correct in thinking that if a farmer takes the land out, the Department is not going to put it back in again?  By going down that route, the farmer definitely loses.  Route two is that the farmer leaves it in.  If a farmer proves in the way I outlined earlier, through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the only people who can confirm his innocence, that the farmer is not in any way being investigated for any illegality and that he or she had no hand, act or part in the burning, will the Minister of State confirm if that is adequate proof, or will he suggest alternative adequate proof?</p><p>The second question is, if a farmer makes that case under <i>force majeure</i>,<i></i>will he be paid?  The third question is as follows.  The Minister of State knows that when hill land burns, it becomes green very fast.  If we give it a month or two in the summer, it could be green for a sufficient period to put stock on it.</p></speech>

There are three parts to my question.  We need &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answers because it is not fair to the farmers.  I know the Minister of State's heart is with us but it is time for him to take control of the Department instead of the Civil Service taking control of him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400035#HH00500"><p>I will be very frank.  Ongoing eligibility checks are carried out.  I had a RAPID field inspection last year.  One is just a random herd number and one is subjected to inspections on an ongoing basis.  The inspectors will be here and because the issue is so high profile, they will be all over it.</p>  <p>  In many ways, the Garda or the NPWS determine guilt or innocence in the first instance.  If an individual is subject to a follow-through and determined to not have been culpable, the first box is ticked and it is accepted that he or she was not responsible.  There is a lot of investigation involved.  In the context of the massive fire that occurred in the Deputy's part of the country, there is the question of where it started.  It is obvious that, as it blazed through, people had no control over whether it affected their property, commonage or anything else.  There were four houses under significant threat.</p>  <p>  On the question of eligibility and fast regrowth, 31 May is the date that has to be considered.  One must comfortably establish in one's own mind that one was not culpable in respect of starting the fire.  These are taken on a case-by-case basis.  Each individual must determine if it is green.  I know the uplands.  We are trying to put a vegetation management plan in place to manage uplands.  It will be controlled and managed and will incorporate controlled burning on a managed basis every year, not just in one year.  If a person is comfortable that the land will be eligible on 31 May, it might be subject to an on-site inspection.  It probably will be subject to such an inspection in any event.  If it is deemed to be grazing or forage land, it is taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  There was a third question.</p></speech>

This is a straightforward motion which arose organically from the upset, heartbreak and anger that survivors and survivors' groups brought to our attention following their interaction with Caranua.  That the Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposes to undermine the importance and impact of the motion by tabling an amendment that upholds the <i>status quo </i>is disingenuous to say the least.  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il not to proceed with the amendment and instead stand in solidarity with survivors who are, to a person, asking for our support in dealing with an organisation that is simply not fit for purpose.</p><p>By way of background, Caranua was established in 2013 pursuant to the 2012 Act with a specific purpose for a specific period, namely, to disburse &euro;110 million provided by a number of religious organisations for those who qualified for payments.  Applicants were required to provide simple proof that they had been to the redress board or received a court award or settlement and show they were in need.  The service provided by Caranua was intended to be straightforward and effective, with minimum bureaucracy.  In the words of its chief executive officer, its purpose &quot;was, and is, to put survivors at the heart of everything that we did&quot;.  She continued, &quot;Our application process is values-based, needs-led and person-centred.&quot;  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a classic example in the 21st century of an institution becoming more important than the people it is meant to serve.  Survivors have confirmed that Caranua's mode of service delivery has added to the abuse they have experienced.</p><p>The inaugural meeting of the Caranua board, which took place on 27 March 2013, was attended by a CEO-designate and the then Minister for Education and Skills.  The Minister committed to holding a review of Caranua within two years of its establishment.  Since then, we have had two more Ministers for Education and Skills and a review has still not been carried out of an organisation that has lurched from crisis to crisis.</p><p>Among the issues identified at the inaugural meeting was the need for smooth and uncomplicated access to the fund.  The first chairwoman of Caranua expressed a desire to have the fund depleted and spent within the four-year term of the board.  She also asked that a common-sense approach be taken.  At that point, the well-respected Institute of Public Administration made a presentation on governance, authority, decision-making and accountability.  The institute was never heard from or invited back again when Caranua opted to take the route of becoming a private company, an issue to which I will return.</p><p>The new board had nine months to get its house in order.  However, during that time a number of members resigned.  The chairwoman tendered her resignation towards the end of 2013 and two survivors also left.  This, in itself, should have raised alarm bells, even if the individuals in question ostensibly left for health reasons.</p><p>It is worth highlighting that the first chairwoman of the board placed a premium on good governance, openness, accountability and a transparent decision-making process.</p><p>At the meeting of 9 July 2013, she stressed the importance of any action outlined in the policy being capable of implementation and that the rule of "what a reasonable person would think and do" would be followed.  The board and the CEO have gone so far from that common rule that it is unbelievable.  After the situation worsened that year and the next, we had the most serious breach of legislation.  An apology was given after the Department made a complaint.  Significantly, that apology was only given by a majority of the board.</p> <p> In 2013, an insidious process of paying private companies out of the limited available funding began.  The second chairperson took up his position in March 2014 and had no hesitation in telling the Committee of Public Accounts that the organisation was a shambles.  Unfortunately, the shambles continued, worsened and intensified under his watch.  Ironically, this happened at the same time that a communications and engagement person was employed.</p> <p> Applications began arriving in January.  This organisation, which had nine months to prepare, was overwhelmed by just 2,134 applications even though it knew from the start that the potential number of people would be 15,500.  It is also worth highlighting that no appeals officer was appointed until March.</p> <p> There were delays and complaints throughout 2014 and more private companies were paid out of the fund.  Imagine a private company being paid for a corporate brand.  Imagine employing companies to tell Caranua about governance and financial issues, case management and staff recruitment, to conduct an external review and to run a bonding exercise for staff in Carlingford at a cost of &euro;1,967.</p> <p> We have minutes that, to say the least, do not inspire confidence in their being a true reflection of decisions and discussions.  The Minister might check an example - two sets of minutes for 22 April 2016 say different things.  There are no minutes at all for 17 September 2015.  In November of that year, a reference to a July meeting was seconded by a board member who was not even at the meeting.  The minutes of 18 February 2016 were seconded on the very day that the meeting took place.  To add to the mystery and confusion, there is a reference in those minutes to a special meeting on 17 December 2015, but there are no minutes of same because we were told on inquiring that it was a workshop.</p> <p> Throughout the various meetings were constant references to the high rate of expenditure.  Those references would be welcome if the expenditure in question was on the bonding exercises and private companies, but no.  They were references to the payout to the survivors who were coming forward.  The board was worried about the level of payout.  It was also worried about the stress that staff were experiencing because of the rate of phone calls, the very reason for Caranua's establishment.  Then there was the discussion on whether there would be money left to give to the children's hospital.</p> <p> A board member distanced himself repeatedly from appallingly punitive language in documents.  He has allowed me to say that, even though he reapplied to be on the board, he has not been accepted.  It is significant that, throughout the minutes, he stood with a number of other survivors in attempting to say that what was happening was wrong.</p> <p> Two years after the inaugural meeting, the minutes indicate that the case management system was still not complete and may contain inaccuracies.  Rather than deal with the delays in consultation with survivor groups, Caranua changed the goalposts numerous times in flagrant breach of the legislation.  It imposed a limit and a priority system.  It built in inequity, injustice and inconsistency.  It blamed survivors.  It sent letters telling them that their cases had been completed but failed to tell them that they could appeal the decisions.  In a Kafkaesque scenario, the appeals officer would not hear an appeal on the grounds that no determination had been made notwithstanding the fact that the survivor had received a letter asserting that the case had been completed.</p> <p> There was no provision for interview facilities.  There was a constant changing of staff.  There was a memorandum of understanding with the Towards Healing service.  In its own accounts, Towards Healing envisaged getting &euro;800,000 from Caranua.  To date, it has received &euro;100,000 on the basis of a memorandum of understanding about which the Minister has no idea and seemingly has not approved.</p> <p> Then there was the rent scenario.  The Minister told the House yesterday that he had no say in the matter, but his Secretary General stated that the Minister did have a say.  More importantly, under section 7(7) of the legislation, the Minister must give permission for a contract.  He has not done that.  At this point, &euro;60 million remains in the fund and there is no chance of it running out.  Will Members stand over this continuing abuse of survivors who have already been appallingly treated by the State?  Now is our opportunity.  We in this Chamber are the voice of the survivors.  I say to Fianna F&aacute;il, let us stand together and show solidarity.</p></speech>

It is important that we try to right some of the wrongs within the Caranua organisation.</p><p>We have a problem with the truth in this country, but we also have a problem with addressing the truth once it has been revealed.  That is obvious in the way we deal with victims of abuse, in this case those who suffered gravely under religious institutions.  From the outset, the Government's attempt to take responsibility for the abuse suffered by victims of institutions was woeful.  The work carried out by Caranua, established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012, has not only failed to deliver for survivors of abuse but has been the source of even more pain and abuse for them.  Among the legitimate complaints made against the organisation, victims have experienced disrespectful and poor treatment.  Of the total, 61% found their experiences with the organisation to be extremely negative while 21% had a negative experience.  This faceless body has made people feel that the State has abandoned them yet again and left them to pick up the pieces of the past while trying desperately to defend their cases for retribution.  These experiences resulted from the fact that so little attention was paid to the establishment of the organisation and how it could best represent and address victims of institutional abuse.</p><p>There was a litany of Government failures in the establishment of Caranua.  For example, an inadequate strategic plan has resulted in progressive deterioration of the services over time.  There is now a waiting time of more than seven months before new applicants to the scheme are allocated advisers.  There have been cases where some applicants have had their applications rejected or put on hold for indefinite periods, many for more than two years.  Applicants have had to go to court to force Caranua to make decisions on their cases.</p><p>There are no interview facilities, making it difficult for survivors to present their cases.  Many survivors have poor levels of literacy, are older and are not computer literate.  When interviews are carried out, some last for longer than three hours with no attention paid to preserving applicants' privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>Caranua's response to potential minor levels of fraud is an overreaction similarly seen in the so-called welfare cheats campaign of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar.  It compromises the integrity and dignity of all other applicants, as each is held under suspicion and must prove to the organisation that he or she is compliant rather than Caranua showing accountability in its decision making on applications.</p><p>It became apparent that Caranua was an organisation hell bent on protecting the funds at the expense of the survivors.  From 2015 on, Caranua refused to process outstanding applications.  This meant that hundreds of applicants were cut off from the fund overnight.  In July 2016, Caranua set the cap amount at &euro;15,000 per applicant, meaning that applicants who legitimately and urgently needed assistance above this limit were refused outright.  To add insult to injury, Caranua carried out this action without consulting survivor groups contrary to section 7(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Act and has refused to release a copy of the internal guidelines that it uses when making decisions.  We still have not seen the review of Caranua's operations that was due in April 2015.</p><p>If I was cynical about this, and sometimes I am, I would think there was a reason behind Caranua's tight grip on access to these funds.</p><p>Could it be that a cap was imposed so as to ensure that millions will be left behind by the time Caranua is wound down, which could then be diverted to the national children's hospital?  Given the apathy presented by the Government towards the needs of survivors so far, I think this is likely to be the reason.  However, it is completely hypocritical given the amount of funds put towards the salaries of agency staff.  More than &euro;2 million was spent on agency staff after the Government only appointed ten people to divide the &euro;110 million between tens of thousands of victims.  According to documents supplied to the Committee of Public Accounts, Caranua also gave &euro;94,000 from compensation paid by religious congregations to a counselling service run by the Catholic Church and unilaterally changed the terms under which people could apply for that funding.  It will also spend over &euro;10,000 a year from the fund on parking spaces for its staff.</p> <p> Deputies across the House have been in contact with a number of survivors and know all too well of the experience of elderly survivors with severe health problems being obliged to validate past abuse in front of the faceless body that is Caranua, only to be treated with contempt and suspicion.  This body has not become the needs-based organisation it was set up to be and has in fact compounded the already negative experience of survivors in a country that took nearly a century to accept responsibility for the abuse incurred by them.  I want to end on what a survivor said to me recently, when he wrote to my office.  He asked me to ask the Government today in the D&aacute;il: why is it provided for some but not for all?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400038#OO00200"><p>I must state that as my engagement and the engagement of my staff with the Caranua office was efficient and courteous, it was very disconcerting and disturbing to learn that was not the norm.  Thanks to Deputy Connolly, Members have the opportunity to address those concerns here.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on my engagement with a particular group, that is, the mixed race Irish and their involvement with Caranua.  They tell me a number of them were not even made aware of the redress scheme because they were excluded from Irish networks in the UK and as a result did not hear of the scheme.  A few of them consequently were denied access to Caranua.  There is a fixed cap of &pound;12,000 for UK survivors versus the &euro;15,000 cap for Irish survivors.  Allowance was never made for exchange rate to be built in so some of the UK survivors are at a disadvantage of more than &pound;900.</p>  <p>  On the cost of education, when Caranua was set up UK university fees were &pound;5,000 but the majority of UK universities are now charging &pound;9,000 in fees.  I am told that Caranua will not pay the increased fees because it states the legislation does not permit this.  The legislation was designed to be flexible to the needs of the survivors but it is being made difficult for survivors who want to pursue third level education.</p>  <p>  Some of the other comments were that survivors find it difficult to deal with the many different advisers because each adviser is giving different advice.  They found the organisation not consistent, particularly with regard to the category of outdoor work.  For example, one member reported that she had received approval for outdoor work and due to the fact the contractor decided he was not going to go ahead with it, the cheque was returned to Caranua.  When she contacted her adviser for a new cheque for a new contractor, she was told she might not get approval for the work again.  Her comment was, "I was upset as I didn't feel understood".  Agreed services were then postponed midway because of the changing priorities of Caranua.  Another lady said that, suddenly, she could not get her dental treatment completed because Caranua decided it was time to allow services for other new applicants.  Her comment was, "I am still waiting".</p>  <p>  There was also confusion as to when quotes from service providers were accepted.  There was a push to get quotes in to Caranua, only for people then to be told that because the backlog of applicants awaiting assessment calls from Caranua, it was likely that these quotes would be out of date.  That was very hard and embarrassing for those clients in terms of going back for the exact same quotes or having to justify the quotes in the first place.</p>  <p>  There was no knowledge of the UK business environment.   For example, small businesses in the UK with a gross income of &pound;83,000 do not have to be VAT registered.  These are the small businesses that are likely to do the small jobs around the house, such as installing occupational therapist-recommended showers.  However, Caranua insists that survivors get VAT-registered companies.  The requested work is too small for VAT-registered companies and Caranua will not accept small business companies.  Hence, the work is not done and the needs are unmet.</p>  <p>  Another lady told me she received only &pound;1,000 approximately from Caranua over two years.  This lady does not own anything and she cannot afford to buy a property or a car or have a holiday.  When she came back to Caranua on the second round application, she was told that somebody would get back to her but she is not a priority as she has already received money, although that was a paltry amount.  She has also been given different information from different people within Caranua.  This lady's educational attainment and language skills would be low, so accessing services and dealing with people is an issue.  It is horrifying to learn that Caranua appears to be taking advantage of her.</p>  <p>  These survivors have all found it very stressful to engage with Caranua.  They have the sense that getting services is a fight.  There is a feeling they are being treated like a 16-year-old leaving care, not as a grown adult.  Again, it is appalling to learn about them receiving a frosty reception to their inquiries and being treated as a nuisance rather than as a client.  These are people who have suffered psychological abuse already, so it is no wonder that some of them are turning to solicitors for help.  Maidir leis an ainm "Caranua", n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil na daoine at&aacute; ag obair i gCaranua r&oacute;chairdi&uacute;il in aon chor.  The point is that these clients have suffered enough already.  They should not be suffering still.</p></speech>

I know it is an issue of continuing concern and that Deputy Clare Daly recently had a Bill before the House.  There is no doubt the backdrop to how Caranua came to be established is the appalling experience of Irish citizens at the hands of residential institutions.  The findings of the Ryan tribunal are chilling when one re-reads them in regard to some of the experiences, in particular the sexual abuse that was endemic in some institutions, as well as the physical and emotional abuse and the failures of the Department of Education itself.  No one diminishes the hurt and damage that many people have experienced and which led to the establishment of Caranua.</p><p>That said, we have to recognise that Caranua was established by this House and the legislative framework under which it operates is one set by this House.  I think it has been pursuing in good faith the efforts under that mandate to support people who had been made awards under the residential institutions procedures.  That legislation obviously classified the areas within which services were to be provided, including mental health counselling, psychological support services, health and personal social services, educational services and housing support services.  There is an obligation on Caranua to ensure that applications comply with the purposes for which the legislation was established and that it uses its resources in a fair way to try to accommodate all those who may yet apply to it.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, some people may still not have applied and it is important the resources are used in such a way that it meets all of those needs as best it can.</p><p>I am the first to recognise there have been many bad experiences among people who have gone to Caranua.  When it was first established, there were a lot of teething problems given it was an organisation getting up and running.  While Deputy Catherine Connolly said the number of applications, which was 2,500, should not have created problems, it did undoubtedly create problems as Caranua was trying to get itself established and get a team in place that could deal with those applications in an effective way.  Nonetheless, while mistakes have been made, I think the board has continued to try to improve and it has tried to extend services.  There is an appeals mechanism in place and being used and 165 appeals were received in 2016.  That appeals mechanism has delivered good outcomes for some of those who made an appeal.  There is also redress to the Ombudsman for those who are not satisfied with the treatment they received.</p><p>Like other Deputies, I have met some of the victims involved and I have heard the complaints that have been set out.  In the process of deciding to have a review, we have had a response to the terms of reference and we will shortly initiate that review.</p><p>There are genuine concerns that need to be addressed.  We need to move to having a stronger charter.  The support available to people needs to be clearer and the procedures need to be the best that they can be.  Eligibility should be extended if that is deemed appropriate.  It is right to continually look at this organisation to ensure it steps up to good practice.</p> <p> The Deputies portrayed Caranua as if it was trying to protect its money for some selfish reason, to prevent money becoming available and to put obstacles in the way of people.  I do not think that represents what it was trying to do.  There have been individual experiences and undoubtedly the Deputies have heard of individual experiences where people came away very dissatisfied.  Deputies have acknowledged that some people may not have the ease of dealing with bureaucracy and as a result of their experience they feel they have been abused again by the way in which a bureaucracy deals.</p> <p> Nonetheless we have established requirements on how money is spent and that has to be observed by any board that is dealing with public money.  For example, one of the Deputies adverted to the requirement to use tax-registered providers.  That is a pretty general provision to ensure that where we are expending public money, those who would be providing the service would meet certain minimum requirements in terms of compliance with tax rules and so on.</p> <p> A number of Deputies raised the question of rent.  Yesterday in the House I made the point that Caranua's board is independent and has to arrange its own accommodation and it must meet the costs for that accommodation from its own resources.  That is in accordance with the legislation that was established.</p> <p> I apologise to Deputy Connolly if I inadvertently did not refer to the fact that if it enters into a contract, it will need ministerial approval.  That is the case.  Many people felt it was unfair that the board would meet its expenses for accommodation from within its own resources but that is what the House provided for.  That is how the board must conduct its affairs.  It has to provide that resource; it is not a separate resource.  That is under the legislation.</p> <p> A number of Deputies spoke about clients who applied from the UK.  While there may be issues in this regard, Caranua has published guidelines for former residents living in the UK.  It has had meetings and outreach events in the UK.  In 2016 it held an outreach event in Manchester and two meetings with Irish welfare organisations and survivor support groups there.  I recognise, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, that some groups may not have been reached.  If there are access points that we should bring to the attention of Caranua, I am sure it will pursue those opportunities.  I will draw Caranua's attention to the debate that we have had here and some of the issues that have been raised.  I think there is a genuine attempt to improve and respond to these needs.</p> <p> We opened applications for a new board back in January.  It was organised under the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  This week I received Government approval for the final appointment.  There were some delays.  Some of those offered positions did not accept them initially even though they had applied and that caused a delay.  I am now in a position to appoint a full board.  It is a mixture of people with experience on the board and new applicants who went through the PAS process, as Deputies would expect.</p> <p> Clearly the legislation places a cap on the money.  Based on the exchanges, it is clear that people felt it was unfair of Caranua to put a cap on amounts paid out to individuals at a stage when people had continuing needs.  However, at this stage more than &euro;60 million has been expended and more than 4,000 people have been supported.  That is from a total application number of 5,800.  There is an expectation that considerably more applications may yet come and will fall to be met from the funds.  Caranua is making an effort to ensure that people who apply later than others will not be disadvantaged in getting support.  That requires the board to try to balance the needs of those who have come forward already and made applications to it and those who may not yet have come forward to make their applications.  The review will need to be mindful of that.</p> <p> I thank the Deputies.  I acknowledge this is an issue of continuing concern and always will be.  The Deputies' motion, however, is unduly negative in its tone.  I accept there is need for improvement and I will be demanding such improvement from the organisation as it sets out its new strategic plan for the years ahead.  That is what will undoubtedly emerge from the review.  There have been bad experiences and mistakes have been made.  We want this organisation to support people.  It needs to be recognised that it is providing very valuable support to many people.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Connolly - despite her comments - for bringing this issue forward.  It is welcome and needed.  As the Minister said, it is being kept on the agenda by various Deputies.  He is right that Deputy Clare Daly introduced a Bill and we had a useful debate then.  Representatives of Caranua will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which is chaired by Deputy O'Loughlin, to discuss the review.  The issue is being addressed.  I hope representatives of Caranua are listening to the dissatisfaction expressed here.  Notwithstanding that we could not sign up to the Deputies' motion in its entirety, our amendment acknowledges there is dissatisfaction and calls on Caranua to address that and to deal with people fairly, expeditiously and efficiently.  Clearly, that has not been happening in a large number of cases.</p>  <p>  There are very serious issues, some of which are detailed in the text of the motion and have been outlined by speakers.  In a debate such as this, it is important to stand by facts.  Deputy Pringle's reference to money going to the national children's hospital is not helpful to the debate.  As he said himself, it is not something he cannot back up.  Sometimes in these debates there is a rush in to slag everybody off because it is seen as the right thing to do politically.</p>  <p>  There is a recognition across the House that there is immense dissatisfaction with Caranua.  We are all getting that from people dealing with that agency.  As I think nearly every speaker has acknowledged and remembered, these are not simply "customers" as described by Caranua; these are victims of serious abuse.  The system, the State and the church have failed them dramatically, devastatingly and disastrously over many years.  This is part of the response of the State - mainly - and the church to compensating people and to making right a wrong, which I do not think could ever really be possible.  Sometimes that is not the perception Caranua gives when dealing with people.  It is not the perception even when it is dealing with Oireachtas Members, as we often do with State bodies.  We do not get the perception from it that this is a different or a special type of organisation.</p>  <p>  The Independents 4 Change motion mentions getting free office space from the Office of Public Works, OPW.</p><p>I understand the intent behind that, which is obviously to preserve the fund for the residents, but there is no doubt that any fund of this type should be considered a project for a period to do a particular job given to it by the Oireachtas.  There will be administrative costs.  It is inevitable that there will be some administration.  I assume everybody accepts that is the case.  It is a question of, first, minimising those costs and, second, trying to make sure that the money is spent as expeditiously as possible.</p> <p> We are prepared to wait a little longer for the review.  We want to see it happen on schedule.  A number of items concerning the Department of Education and Skills have not happened on schedule but this must happen because we are dealing with victims and we must keep repeating that.  We are prepared to do that and to meet Caranua at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  Anyone can attend the committee; it is not just for the members.  We will examine the review when it comes before the committee and ensure that the recommendations of the Oireachtas are implemented and there is some scrutiny by the Department in that regard.  We are prepared to wait for July.  Our countermotion calls on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills to scrutinise the recommendations and engage with stakeholders including survivors.  Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin can speak for herself but she has put that on the agenda of the committee recently and arrangements are being made in that regard.  Our countermotion calls on Caranua to address the operational failures that have been identified in some of its service provision and administration.  We make an explicit commitment to facilitating the passage of any legislative changes that are required to implement changes to eligibility or Caranua functions that are recommended by the review and approved by the stakeholders.</p> <p> We want to be as constructive as possible in recognition of the suffering that has been caused.  The assumption is that, generally speaking, the people who work in State bodies want to do a good job and look after the citizens of the country.  A law should be introduced to ban the word "customer" from State bodies, local authorities and other such bodies.  The assumption is that when people are dealing with citizens that they will try to do a good job.  If they fail in that it is up to us to hold them to account.  That is what this motion should be about and that is what we should be doing while, first and foremost, remembering the victims and keeping their needs as the highest priority.</p> <p> I am sure the people in Caranua are listening to this debate.  They need to redouble their efforts to make sure the money is spent on the victims and to bring this project to an end when the money is spent.  As a secondary matter, Caranua must redouble its efforts when dealing with Members of the Oireachtas who may be representing victims who might not be in a position to represent themselves fully or ably due to their circumstances or for whatever reason.  Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to do that.  Our countermotion is not proposed out of any major disagreement with Independents 4 Change: we just felt that some of the emphasis in the motion was not supportable but we certainly welcome the opportunity to have the debate.</p></speech>

I say that despite the cynical comments of Deputy Connolly about my party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  I remind her and others that they do not have a monopoly on care and compassion.  Fianna F&aacute;il as a party is very compassionate and concerned about some of the unfolding stories in relation to Caranua.</p>  <p>  This motion again sheds a light on a very shameful part of this country&rsquo;s history.  The Ryan report of 2009 laid bare the full extent of the horrific treatment that was meted out to children who were placed in religious institutions.  We cannot and should not ever forget that.  The &euro;110 million that was given to Caranua by religious congregations was supposed to enhance the lives of abuse survivors.  The money was supposed to be spent on health and well-being, housing support, education, learning and development and in some small way to try to address the profound damage done to people who were placed in those institutions.  We know that some 5,000 survivors of the possible 15,000, one third of eligible applicants, have applied to the scheme since January 2014.</p>  <p>  I contend that issues became apparent as soon as clients began to make calls to avail of the support on offer.  I and other Members have heard of significant communication issues, namely, calls unanswered and not responded to, application forms delayed for months, non-allocation of case managers and case managers being changed frequently and a lack of clarity on entitlements.  They are just some of the issues of concern that have been raised.  It became apparent quite quickly that the organisation had commenced dealing with survivors without sufficient processes and procedures in place.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to many survivors and heard that old feelings were then triggered such as not having a voice, not being worthy, not being deserving of help and respect and feeling fearful and intimidated.  Caranua rightly provided counselling for survivors and one of the issues the counsellors are dealing with relate to the experiences of survivors with the agency that was established to support them.  It is shocking to think that the fund established to support individuals has in many cases resulted in further trauma to an already vulnerable group of individuals.</p>  <p>  Serious concerns have been raised regarding the administration of the fund.  We know that some people have been left waiting up to 18 months for cheques to be paid.  Survivors of institutional child abuse have rightfully queried why the administration costs are being paid out of the general compensation fund.  They feel that money set aside for them is being unnecessarily squandered on administration costs.  There are serious concerns that the increasing administrative costs will reduce the dwindling redress funds available to survivors.  The introduction of new, complicated and confusing guidelines for survivors and the seemingly arbitrary &euro;15,000 limit on payments have caused significant problems and that should be acknowledged.  Survivors describe themselves as being re-traumatised by the body because of the issues I have outlined and many survivors feel that Caranua has failed in its core duty to assist them in living full and dignified lives.</p>  <p>  Survivors have spoken to me about feeling intimidated, not respected, upset and traumatised.  One of my constituents, a man whom I know for many years, is a survivor of an industrial school.  He put his past behind him, worked hard and raised a family all the while keeping the trauma of his childhood to himself so as not to burden his family.  He phoned a helpline having watched a documentary on the redress scheme and now considers it the worst thing he ever did.  Engaging with the redress system felt like abuse all over again because of the manner in which he was treated and he felt re-traumatised by the whole experience.</p>  <p>  The ongoing review of eligibility and of approved services for Caranua needs to be completed and then considered by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which I chair, together with the views of stakeholders.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of getting the views of the stakeholders.  Full consultation with the survivors is required.  The review must address the operational failure in its service provision and administration.  Survivors should be consulted in a meaningful way and the process should be survivor-led and survivor-centred.  Only in that way can we help to restore the dignity of survivors in a fair, compassionate and respectful way.</p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, outlined, Fianna F&aacute;il's countermotion calls on the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to examine the recommendations of the review carefully and to engage with all stakeholders.  Caranua must fairly and efficiently provide support and services to all survivors of institutional abuse and acknowledge and address the dissatisfaction with some of its operations.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Eugene Murphy.</p></speech>

I am not going to go bashing anybody but this issue is discussed quite a lot by our party and we have dealt with people who have been victims of such abuse.  No Deputy in the House has a monopoly on these issues, so to portray Fianna F&aacute;il as a party that does not care about this issue or does not do any work in the area compared to others is just not fair.</p><p>While Fianna F&aacute;il has submitted an amendment on this motion we also have our own counter motion, as Deputies O'Loughlin and Byrne have said.  I believe there are elements of the motion that have real merit and there are many positives to it, especially the proposals to consider streamlining the process, to provide face-to-face appointments with applicants, to draw up a new survivor-led customer charter and to establish and clarify a system of appropriate oversight of the operations of Caranua.  All of these recommendations are welcome, but it is important that we await the review of Caranua's eligibility criteria.  This is ongoing and due in a very short time, hopefully in July.  Yes, there may be a need to expand the eligibility criteria for Caranua and its services but we should wait to hear the recommendations of the statutory review, in conjunction with the stakeholders' views, before supporting specific proposals to expand eligibility.</p><p>We all know that reviews cost money and we should at least wait to see the outcome of the current review process before establishing another overlapping, duplicative review.  It is very important in the process in which we are now engaged to get this right because there are situations and difficulties.  I recall a recent article in <i>The Irish Times </i>about Caranua.  The article specifically referred to what Caranua's guidelines said: &quot;We will listen to you ... we will treat you courteously [and] fairly ... and [will] apologise if we get something wrong and do our best to put it right.&quot;  These are the guidelines that are set out by Caranua.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il's counter motion makes an explicit commitment to facilitate the passage of any legislative changes required to implement any reforms to eligibility and Caranua functions, which may be recommended by the review or as part of the stakeholder engagement.  We must remember that the function of Caranua is to provide support to people who, as children, experienced abuse in residential institutions.  Those institutions, many of which were run by religious orders, were funded and regulated by the State.  Of the &euro;110 million that has been pledged to the scheme &euro;56 million has been expended in the support of more than 4,000 eligible former institution residents.  It is imperative that we do nothing that could jeopardise or impact the 4,000 former residents who are in receipt of funding or services, or to deplete the funding pool for the approximately 15,000 people who are eligible.</p><p>Let us not forget that we are talking about not just numbers and figures.  These are real people who have been left with a huge heartbroken void in their lives.  These are people who suffered horrific abuse by the very institutions that were supposed to protect, nurture and take care of them.  I would be fearful that some of the proposals in the motion today could have unintended consequences and need, therefore, to be scrutinised very, very carefully.  For example, one proposal seeks to expand eligibility for the fund to include former residents who have not previously sought a settlement.  The Department states that this amendment would mean that anybody who had attended a residential institution would, technically, be able to apply to the fund.  There is no way of knowing how many potential recipients this could include.  This could overload the scheme.  It could also deplete resources that are earmarked for existing survivors and services provided by Caranua.  Everybody agrees and accepts that something needs to be done, but whatever we do, we need to get it right. </p></speech>

I confirm that Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the motion proposed by Independents 4 Change and I commend them for raising this issue for debate.  It is an important issue that details the harrowing experiences of too many people in the State.</p>  <p>  I attended a briefing today.  One of the speakers was a co-founder of the Aislinn Centre and is a survivor of institutional abuse, Carmel McDonnell-Byrne.  She pointed out that regression was evident in the people after dealing with Caranua and very often many of these survivors reported that they felt suicidal.  Serious questions must be asked of Caranua, an organisation that is supposed to support these people, for what it has done to them.  We must challenge the wrongs and put them right.</p>  <p>  I am extremely disappointed that the review of the terms of eligibility for the redress scheme has been delayed.  This review was to take place within two years of the establishment of the fund and it is a crucially important issue for survivors.  Many survivors have been excluded from making a claim under the redress scheme as it stands.  I see absolutely no reason why categories of survivors are excluded.  These people have suffered shocking abuse and neglect from seeking this redress, which they should be able to seek.  This must be addressed immediately and the eligibility criteria broadened to include survivors of other institutions.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the calls for this review to be established and to report within a three month timeframe.</p>  <p>  We need to tackle the bureaucracy and red tape that is proving to be a barrier for many survivors in accessing supports under the fund.  The difficulties encountered by survivors in seeking redress cannot continue and need to be addressed urgently.  These brave, strong and courageous people have been failed by the State on too many occasions and it cannot continue.  They should not have to battle now to access redress under the scheme.</p>  <p>  I also echo the sentiments of colleagues on the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  While Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the development of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and hopes it will be completed without delay, we strongly believe that it should be funded by the State.  There should be no question of using survivors' funds to build the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  While it is likely that the fund will be exhausted, the provision that any remaining funds would be put towards the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital should be removed from the legislation, for the purposes of clarity.</p>  <p>  It was reported in this week's media that Caranua has allegedly used a significant sum to provide for office premises.  It is my understanding that the legislation requires the body to seek the approval of the Minister prior to entering into any contract.  We need clarity as to whether the Minister is aware of the details of any agreement and if he has given approval for such an agreement.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this motion, which seeks to ensure that funding for the day-to-day operations of Caranua will not be taken from redress funding for survivors.  Many survivors of residential institutional abuse have such difficulties in accessing redress funds to help them move on with their lives and it is an absolute insult for them to know that this money is being spent on operations for Caranua.  There is a clear need for oversight of the operation of this fund.  The fact that Caranua has been allowed to operate in the absence of a governing board is simply not good enough.  A new board must be appointed immediately and clear accountability arrangements put in place to ensure that the funding is being used for its intended purpose.  The abuse survivors who sit on the board should be listened to on this new board.</p><p>It is my understanding that this has not been happening to date.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and put in place the right supports to help survivors move on with their lives.  I hope this motion will send a clear message to survivors that they are not alone and that we will stand with them.  I encourage all Deputies to support this motion.</p></speech>

This is an important issue of concern to many of us.  As stated by Deputy Nolan, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the call for measures to include an immediate review of the operations of Caranua and for negotiations between the Department and the OPW on an appropriate solution that will not incur a cost to the survivors' fund, the latter being absolutely crucial.  It is important to emphasise that Caranua is an organisation set up to serve and address the needs of those affected by atrocious crimes and abuses in this State.  It exists to provide a service and to administer State funds and there should be no confusion about that.</p>  <p>  During my time as a councillor prior to my election to this House and during my time since as a Deputy, I have often questioned the role of Caranua.  My experience with the organisation on behalf of constituents has been extremely negative.  Frequently the response from the organisation is that survivors are not eligible for this or that.  Regardless of what a person is applying for he or she seems to fall outside the criteria.  No appeals process is evident and it is not possible to meet with anyone to discuss an issue.  Only last week, in response to representations on behalf of a constituent, I received a lengthy form to be completed by the constituent to confirm it was okay for me to deal with the matter on behalf of that constituent, with no consideration having been given to whether the person concerned had a difficulty with reading and writing.  I am delighted that Deputy Connolly has brought forward this motion.  It is time we started discussing this issue.  </p>  <p>  Given the manner in which people are being treated by the system, it is not appropriate to refer to it as part of a healing process.  The overall attitude of Caranua needs to change dramatically.  The tone and language used by the CEO in the past epitomises the ethos of the organisation.  The message that comes across is one of "get over it and move on", which, unfortunately, is the way we deal with everything in this country.  How many times have we debated mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries and so on in this House, all of us using words such as "terrible" and "horrible" in that regard yet we are allowing similar things to happen.  This is happening under our watch.  We need to ensure change is brought about.  This can be done if Deputies support this motion tonight.</p>  <p>  I fear that Caranua to date has become a self-regulating system with little accountability.  Unless the recommendations in this motion are acted on, the overall reputation and operations of Caranua will remain questionable.  I urge all Deputies to support this motion.</p></speech>

It has emerged in recent days that there are a few discrepancies in how this money has been spent, with funding allocated to provide services to survivors having been spent on rent of a premises by Caranua.  It is my understanding that the Committee of Public Accounts received a letter stating that Caranua had paid &euro;50,000 to the OPW in the past year towards rent for office space and that it owes a further &euro;56,000 in that regard.  Despite this, there have been claims that Caranua has spent nothing in the past year on rent for office space.  This has created some confusion.  I understand from reports that the CEO wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts on Monday of this week asking that the record of the Committee of Public Accounts meeting of 13 April last be corrected.  The CEO stated in that letter that she had stated Caranua had rent-free accommodation from 2013 to May of this year.  She noted this should have been stated as May of last year and was a mistake in her delivery of the information.  Members will make of that what they will but the Committee of Public Accounts was presented with false information.</p>  <p>  The CEO has clarified the conflicting remarks and has confirmed that Caranua has paid &euro;50,000 to date and arrears of &euro;56,000 are outstanding to the OPW.  We need clarity on this issue.  Will the Minister provide clarity on what was and was not paid from 2013 onwards, as this is central to the wider debate on why rent payments are made from the fund allocated to supporting survivors?  Does the Minister believe that he and his Department have been sufficiently robust in the oversight of the organisation or have they been asleep at the wheel?  Why is Caranua paying rent to the OPW?  It is wrong that the Departments are unable to work out a deal given the enormous estate they own in terms of properties.  The fund is specifically for survivors.  It is important to point out that Caranua is no ordinary public body.  Many public bodies provide essential services that are funded from resources provided to them by the State.  The fund about which we are speaking is intended for survivors and the manner in which it is being spent is wrong.  </p>  <p>  I note the amendment presented by the Minister contains a commitment to carry out a review of the eligibility criteria.  We need a timeline in that regard and clarity on whether further survivors are to be included.  I share many of the reservations and concerns expressed.  I have heard many stories from constituents on their frustration at the service they have received from Caranua, the arbitrary cap being a significant issue.  In common with the mother and baby home inquiry, there is a lack of opportunity for people to have their voices heard by Caranua.  It is wrong that survivors are being forced to deal with paper-only bureaucracy and that they do not have the opportunity to discuss their cases and needs.</p></speech>

I knew little about this organisation up to six months ago.  I now have a lot of information about it, including in relation to the recent briefing.  In my view, Caranua is not fit for purpose at this point in time.  The survivors for whom the organisation was set up to assist have been met with belligerence and confusion in terms of its operations.  Caranua was set up to financially compensate survivors for the grotesque violence meted out to them at a particular time and to give them justice but in my view, it is being run like a business.  The inner workings not of Caranua but the board are bizarre.  As stated by Deputy Funchion, the CEO of Caranua made an extraordinary statement recently that was very demeaning.  While she has since retracted that statement, it is indicative of the inner workings of Caranua.</p>  <p>  The survivors were systematically abused in the past and are now trying to get justice.  Hopefully they will get it.  I welcome this debate, which throws up many questions about the organisation.  Hopefully, people will get some sort of justice, as well as clarity on Caranua.</p></speech>

In regard to the &euro;110 million fund, what interest has built up on it in the intervening years since it was established and is that interest being added to the fund for the survivors?  If not, why not?  I would appreciate an answer to that question.</p><p>Why does Caranua not pay people a lump sum, similar to a pension?  As far as I am aware, a person has to jump through many hoops to qualify for a payment.</p><p>My understanding is that, in order for funds to be disbursed, they must be for health or well-being, housing support, education, learning or development and cannot be for something that has already been bought, for something which is not recommended by a professional or for ongoing costs such as rent, mortgages and so on.  There seems to be a presumption of irresponsibility and this is wrong.  There almost appears to be a presumption of criminality.  Why not give these people a lump sum?  Why not give an annual lump sum - something like a pension - payable twice a year?  We might not know how many people will be involved in the scheme but the scheme will only last for a number of years and the numbers should be easy to calculate - one could even err on the side of caution.  The criteria are very narrow and often rigidly applied.  For somebody who suffered in a Magdalen laundry, the act of washing clothes and putting them on the line brings back all kinds of memories.  It would be a positive thing to be able to buy a washing machine but it would not easy to do so under the rigid criteria that have been set out.</p> <p> Major questions have to be asked about the way survivors who apply are being treated.  Deputy Gino Kenny referred to the comments of the chief executive, who called them "these people" and said they were damaged and would never be happy.  I welcome the fact that those comments were withdrawn at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Her comment about funeral arrangements, however, was of more concern to me.  Caranua can apparently give up to &euro;5,000 to a funeral director to provide a decent burial for survivors when their time comes but it was revealed that some - very few - had approached funeral directors to ask for the &euro;5,000 to be released to them for weekly or monthly expenditure.  Why was that revealed?  Was there an attempt to make out that the survivors are feckless and undeserving?  It is completely understandable that survivors would have approached funeral directors in that way.  If people live in conditions of hardship and poverty it is entirely understandable and I cannot understand why the information was made public.  It was wrong to do so.  There is no privity of contract and I do not think that, if &euro;5,000 is given to a funeral director and the funeral director goes out of business, the family of a survivor who has passed away has a claim over the money.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</p> <p> I know of two survivors who did not have the skills of reading and writing and who went to another survivor who did have those skills.  The latter went to Caranua and asked to fill in the form on behalf of the former but he was laughed at, which is a disgrace.  I understand that a U-turn was announced at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting and that, in future, a third party will be able to fill in a form in this way.  I welcome that but it should not have happened in the first instance.</p> <p> Under section 10, the Government can instruct the board of Caranua as to things that should or should not be done.  Given everything that has happened, the idea that the new board, which I welcome, should report to a committee of the House is progressive and positive and serious consideration should be given to it.</p></speech>

The motion hits the nail on the head.  I have had personal experience of dealing with individuals who had made contact with this organisation.  I wondered if the bad experiences I had were just one-off instances or whether the reason I did not get on so well with my cases was down to me.  When I saw the motion, however, I realised that it is a real problem so I was very glad the Deputies brought it forward.</p>  <p>  An individual I knew in County Kerry made an application for funding for necessary works to a house, the condition of which was unimaginable.  I was contacted to deal with the matter and intervened but the obstacles I met were frightening.  The person in question was living in conditions in which one would not allow an animal to live.  I thought Caranua would be responsible, proactive and workmanlike.  All I want from people, whether a politician or someone in any other job, is that they work.  However, the people with whom I spoke on the other end of the telephone had a hopeless and pathetic work ethic.  If they were working for me, I would sack them and I would not pay them their wages for the following week.  We are all paid to do a job but I found myself waiting and waiting.  I tried dozens of times to get through to the relevant persons in Caranua but I often failed to do so.  As the motion points out, there was a significant turnover of staff.  In the case to which I refer and which upset me greatly, the person responsible for dealing with it changed on two or three occasions.  When there was a change of staff, I was back to square one and there was no such thing as a file at which they could look, to see the pictures and the case history that we had carefully provided.  We did our side of the job perfectly well and they just had to get off their backsides and deal with it.  Instead, there was obstacle after obstacle.  If my case is an exemplar of the general issues, then there is a serious problem with this organisation.</p>  <p>  The survivors went through enough hardship and they should not be faced with such poor delivery of service from an organisation that is there to assist them and bring some ease to their lives.  People who are vulnerable and have gone through these awful situations may have complicating factors in their lives.  It is similar to a car going off course.  When that happens, it is difficult to get it back on track.  These people had a very tough beginning and now they are being let down by the very organisation that was set up to help and support them.  I support the motion and I thank the Deputies for bringing it forward.</p></speech>

I, too, have had many constituents who were shabbily treated.</p><p>This redress process is intended to help people who suffered in the past.  This organisation, like so many other quangos in quangoland, has a chief executive and a plethora of offices.  It is renting new offices and suites of offices.  We have to stop this.  I discussed the issue of the different advocacy agencies and the CEOs and chairmen with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  We are sick and tired of this.  The redress process must be about the victims.  I fully support the motion.</p> <p> The Minister said earlier that he would pass on the comments, sentiments and emotions expressed to Caranua.  He should take charge and instruct it to spend the money on services for the unfortunate people who have suffered enough, rather than renting offices or setting up suites of offices or paying a CEO and so on.  This country is contaminated; it is like a disease.  There is an epidemic of CEOs and chairmen and boards and so on.  We need a bit of humanity to deliver a service to people who deserve it.  Funding for Caranua comes from many places, including the redress board, the Catholic Church and elsewhere.  Let it be given to the people.  People are in tears because they ring up and get a case officer and then the case officer cannot or will not take a call from them.  It is a bureaucratic jungle and it must be changed.  I want the Minister to take charge and wrest back control from these career people who are looking out for jobs to set up whatever new organisation or quango comes into being.  I am talking about the chiefs, not the ordinary people answering the phones or the dinner people.  They become chiefs overnight, get aloof, go for the fancy offices and think they are untouchable and can spend money whatever way they like.  They rent nice fancy offices with fancy furniture, they travel and they have meetings, conferences and so on.  It should be about the victims.  For too long, the victims have suffered.  We must get rid of this and stop it and get some kind of a mechanism to stop the spread of quangoland that has become an epidemic in this country.  This is one place it should not be.</p></speech>

I thank Independents 4 Change, and Deputy Connolly in particular, for bringing forward the motion and I commend them on it.  I fully support the motion, in particular the call for a root-and-branch review not just of the  criteria and policies of Caranua but also its operation.  Based on what we know of the conduct of Caranua and its interaction with survivors, that is absolutely required.</p>  <p>  The motion says that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recognises that "the statutory body Caranua has, to date, failed a large number of applicants in providing adequate access to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund" and "the high number of complaints and reports of dissatisfaction and negative experiences from applicants to that fund".  That is the nub of the issue.  Survivors with whom I have been in contact have had universally negative experiences in their contact with Caranua.  They have encountered a particular attitude, hostility and been subjected to confrontational questioning.  They feel that they are treated as a nuisance.  In many cases, their contact with Caranua has led to further trauma for them.  A significant number of complaints have been made, most of which relate to disrespectful behaviour, poor treatment and dissatisfactory communications with survivors.  A survey indicates that 61% of survivors have rated their experience with Caranua as extremely negative and 21% as negative.  One survivor commented that dealing with Caranua was like being back in an institution and that at least in the institution one knew who the enemy was, whereas with Caranua the enemy is faceless.  That is the type of reaction of survivors who have contacted me regarding their communication and contact with Caranua.  There have also been significant delays.  Survivors say that the level of service was always poor but has become more negative and stressful.  Communication with survivors has been less than adequate.  There has been a lack of confidentiality and privacy in that regard.  Survivors feel they have been re-abused through their contacts with Caranua.</p>  <p>  Clarification is needed on the issue of rent and whether it has been paid.  There was some confusion in that regard, although things were somewhat clarified when representatives from Caranua appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Was the Minister's approval sought in respect of the rental contract and the payment of that rent?  If approval was sought, was it granted?  What were the surrounding circumstances?</p>  <p>  There have been several serious and unacceptable breaches of the legislation.  That needs to be urgently reviewed.  The failure to review Caranua after two years of operation was a missed opportunity which survivors have paid for in recent years.  Survivors who contacted me regarding this issue gave the impression that there is attitude and hostility in dealing with survivors and also an element of chaos in the operation of Caranua.</p>  <p>  There is currently no board, oversight or governance of the organisation.  Even when the board was in existence, there was a lack of oversight and governance of the operation of Caranua.  The board is supposed to comprise nine members, four of whom are survivors.  In the context of the operation of an organisation of this nature and in light of the funds available to it, I am of the view that survivors should be in a majority on the board.</p>  <p>  I confirm my support for the motion.  I call for an urgent review of the operation of Caranua and the criteria relating to its governance.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation in respect of the rent payment and whether approval was sought and received for that rent.</p></speech>

It is quite incredible that Deputy Bruton is the third Minister for Education and Skills to whom we have had to highlight the shortcomings of Caranua.</p><p>The scheme as it presently operates is re-traumatising people.  We have to put a stop to this tonight.  When we raise issues and concerns in here, there should be corrective action as a result.  I find it shocking that when we discussed this in March when my Bill was before the House, everybody on every side - including the Minister - agreed that there were problems with the operation of the scheme and that the message had to go out loud and clear that this needed to be corrected.  What happened after that?  It was after this that the CEO of Caranua went on the airwaves and caused such trauma and offence to people, lacking empathy and displaying an incredibly negative attitude to survivors.  I reject the point made by other Deputies that the point was corrected afterwards.  It was not really retracted.  The views demonstrated the continued entrenchment of the poor attitudes that other Deputies have articulated so well.  <br/><br/>I am quite sure that Rhona in my office, who deals with many of these cases, would have great sympathy for the case outlined by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae because those types of stories are ones with which she deals on a regular basis.  There are long delays, people are denied access and there are issues with the offices, among other problems.  So bad is the operation of this scheme that there were reports in the media this week of William Gorry, who has said that he will take out a loan to repay the money he got from Caranua because he is so traumatised by the treatment he received and the public comments of the CEO.  William rang my office this morning.  He is very down.  His entire life has been adversely affected by the abuse he has suffered.  He has trust issues, and he says that his quality of life is so poor that he wonders why he is still alive.  Imagine picking up the phone and saying that to some stranger in an office?  He finished the phone call and took the opportunity to write down his story and asked me to inform the Minister about it here tonight.  He sent in an email after the chat this morning.  He said:</p><blockquote>I am a 51 year old gay man, visually impaired.  As a child in Mount Carmel Industrial School, Moate, County Westmeath, I suffered horrendous abuse, verbally, physically, sexually and emotionally.  The institution and the State failed me in not receiving love, care, nurture and education.  I wasn't equipped with the tools for the outside world.  As an adult on a blind pension I am restricted in having any type of a life.  On leaving care I have been through hell.  Carrying the horrendous abuse of my childhood, I have been plagued by the memories of what happened to me as a child and the humiliation of failures and lost opportunities in adulthood.  I haven't been able to live up to my full potential, to form or maintain friendships or relationships.  This has caused me huge sadness and embarrassment.  On leaving care I should have been able to enjoy happiness, good health, lots of friends, safe in the knowledge that there was a good path ahead of me - love, care, a good job, a partner, maybe a marriage - but this was sadly not to be.  I have been treated harshly, abruptly by Caranua, and the remarks of its CEO, Mary Higgins, have devastated and hurt me emotionally and caused me huge pain.  Minister, [William says] at this moment and for quite some time my life is lonely, miserable, restricted, fearful and painful.  I seem to carry and wear all my life sufferings, not being able to move forward.  It seems the State lives my life and not me.  The last while I really wonder is it best that I didn't exist at all.  I wish I never had to describe myself or my life like this.  Minister, maybe you could consider meeting me and allowing me to express how broken I am and how empty my life is.  William Gorry, survivor.</blockquote><p>We have had so many stories like that and so many people have called our office in tears, talking about their abuse and what happened to them when they contacted Caranua.  Comments such as &quot;Couldn't you have got a cheaper hoover?  You could build a mansion for that price.  This isn't a sweet shop, you know&quot;.  We have heard stories of people being physically questioned in department stores as to what institution they were in.  This was supposed to be a process that was a straightforward way of helping people who were hurt by our State and church.  It was supposed to be part of an acknowledgement and an apology for what was inflicted on them.  Let us remember that every time these people fill in a form or speak to a stranger on the phone or send letters or emails they have to relive and remember the abuse, the violence, the fear, their own lack of power, the lack of protection and how badly let down they felt.  They actually have no obligation to explain themselves to anybody and we should not be putting them in that position. <br/><br/>There are a couple of specific issues that I want to raise.  The problems in many cases are caused by the decision to limit face-to-face meetings.  The Government's amendment has partially addressed this but it is not enough.  The main method of communication, via phone and email, is hugely problematic.  It is very impersonal.  It keeps survivors at arm's length.  There are long periods when there is no communication at all and if one is not meeting another person, it is hard to read their body language or really get to know them and help them properly.  There is a better way of doing things, and I argue that at least 70% of Caranua's staff application advisers should be deployed on a face-to-face appointment basis four days a week, seeing on average four clients a day.  On the fifth day of the week could be a follow-up on paperwork.  The face-to-face visit could be a home visit or an appointment to an outreach surgery if the person was vulnerable.  If ten Caranua advisers were deployed in this way, 40 people a day and 160 per week would receive proper face-to-face support.  In ten weeks it could see 1,600 survivors, whose issues would have been dealt with via a serious level of contact on a level that the person could appreciate.  This would go a long way to breaking down communication barriers that are hindering the interactions with survivors and would in that way assist in the reconciliation process.  It would enable swift and clear responses and explanations being given directly to the survivors.  It would be an important point of contact where they could get advice and support on other services specific to their needs.  It would enable it to act as a gateway to other mainstream services.  It could allow families and other representatives of survivors to accompany them to the appointment, to help with the explanation and de-stress some of the experience.  It would certainly enable Caranua staff to develop an awareness and understanding of what some of these people have gone through.  In that sense, face to face is a key part of this motion, and it would compensate for the imbalance of power that survivors often experience when they communicate with professionals.  They are called professionals but in the real meaning of the word have not been professional at all.<br/><br/>Certain groups of people have raised particular concerns about the quality of information being provided by Caranua.  One of these is the deaf community.  The Irish Deaf Society feel that deaf people are at a disadvantage in this process.  The clinic held by Caranua at the Deaf Village in Dublin is held once a month on a weekday and during working hours.  This obviously limits the ability of people to interact.  It is inadequate in terms of its frequency.  They cannot pick up the phone and talk to somebody and get the information afterwards.  They require face-to-face meetings.  On balance that should have been addressed before now.  The Irish Deaf Society first made contact with Caranua in 2012 and stressed the importance of making Irish Sign Language translations available.  It has taken almost four years for the videos to appear online so that people can get the information.  That is four years were people have missed out on a chance to get involved.  As mentioned by other Deputies the group of survivors in the UK are also at a significant advantage.  It is worrying that less than 20% of applicants are from the UK when we know that over 32% of applications to the redress board were based in the UK.  <br/><br/>The scheme is three and a half years old.  There are people who applied in January 2014 who have received no payment.  That is utterly shocking.  It has a staffing bill that has risen to &euro;1.5 million per year.  Some &euro;2 million is being spent on agency staff.  God only knows what is going on.  The office has consultancy bills for Capita and Mazars for over &euro;180,000.  This is happening while survivors are struggling.  The review is long past its date and it needs to be carried out with absolute urgency.</p><p>A strong message needs to be sent on this issue.  It has gone on for far too long.</p></speech>

Many individuals suffered horrific abuse when, as children, they were placed in industrial schools and other residential settings.  Successive Governments have put in place strategies to support former residents through the provision of services including counselling and educational supports.  I have heard many of the contributions to this debate on the motion.  I appreciate the sincere and genuine interest of all contributors in the need to ensure those who suffered abuse as children in residential institutions receive the support that they require.</p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns regarding Caranua have been raised in the media and in this House.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has met survivors himself and I know he appreciates their concerns.  I believe it is vital that the State, in all its dealings with victims of abuse, ensures survivors are always dealt with in a sensitive, fair and compassionate manner.  While there have been difficulties which we all recognise, Caranua has got many things right.  It started virtually from scratch in 2013 and began to design a scheme that would support individuals who have complex needs and who live in every part of the country and overseas.  Caranua began to accept applications in early 2014 and has to date received more than 5,800 applications.  It has paid &euro;60 million in supports to more than 4,000 former residents.  Due to reasons of confidentiality, it was restricted in directly contacting eligible former residents and was required to rely on advertising and marketing, including through the good offices of many bodies and organisations.</p>  <p>  Caranua&rsquo;s aim is to provide a responsive, friendly and professional service.  It drew up criteria and guidelines and amended those in 2016 in the light of experience and feedback from applicants.  It expanded the range of approved services it could support last year to include funeral costs and certain other areas of support, indicating a willingness to take on board the views of applicants.  The organisation welcomes feedback and has addressed complaints through its customer service charter and its feedback and complaints policy which may be accessed via its website.  However, it would be helpful for Caranua to review its current customer charter, in consultation with survivors, ensuring that the principles of equity, consistency and transparency are at the heart of all its activities.</p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues available to individuals who are dissatisfied with the service they receive from Caranua, including a complaints and feedback process, an appeal to an independent appeals officer and review by the Ombudsman.  It is, of course, also important that Caranua seeks to improve the level of engagement with and service to those whom it is there to help.  The Minister has recently approved a proposal whereby two new appeals officers have been appointed to replace the outgoing appeals officer.  It is hoped that this will lead to speedier decisions and will clear the backlog of appeals that has built up.</p>  <p>  Caranua was set up as an independent body under law.  The 2012 Act sets out the respective powers and function of both Caranua itself and the Minister.  The motion appears to call on the Minister for Education and Skills to use Exchequer funds to meet costs associated with Caranua&rsquo;s office accommodation.  That is not allowed under the provisions of the 2012 Act.  The motion also seems to suggest that section 43 of the 2012 Act should be removed.  That provision has nothing to do with Caranua.  The 2012 Act caps Caranua&rsquo;s funding at &euro;110 million.  Section 43 provides that any additional contributions, that is, contributions other than those that form the &euro;110 million, will go towards the cost of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I understand there is at least one commitment by a congregation to make such a contribution and the Minister remains hopeful that other congregations will augment their cash contributions.  The retention of section 43 is therefore very important.  As I said, it has no bearing on the funding available for Caranua or for the survivors.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has also announced a consultation on proposed draft terms of reference for a review of eligibility for Caranua.  The outcome of that consultative process will be published shortly.  The review of eligibility will be completed this summer.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion represents a balanced approach.  It acknowledges the suffering of those who were abused and the steps taken already by the State to support them.  It acknowledges also that many former residents have ongoing needs.  It notes the progress being made by Caranua, including the support it has provided to survivors residing in the United Kingdom.  Various meetings and outreach events have been held in that respect.  Granted, the message has not reached everybody, so those efforts will continue.  It notes various developments in respect of Caranua, including the fact the range of approved services was extended in 2016 and that progress is being made in regard to the eligibility review.  It also notes that section 43 of the 2012 Act must be retained as it is an important provision that will facilitate additional contributions over and above the &euro;110 million earmarked for Caranua, going towards the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>  <p>  As the Government amendment to the motion states, it would also be helpful to survivors if Caranua could provide a greater level of face-to-face engagement with survivors and applicants, particularly after the organisation moves into the new office accommodation which will be more suitable for this kind of activity.  Caranua should continue to provide regular statistics to the Department of Education and Skills and the public on waiting times for processing and communicating decisions.  To date, &euro;97 million has been received into the fund.  I am informed that the balance of the &euro;110 million is expected to be received by 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government amendment to the motion is a fair statement of the current position in respect of Caranua and it addresses in an appropriate manner a number of important matters.  To touch on one or two issues that have been raised in respect of rent, the legislation is very clear that the administration costs must come from the fund.  The Minister will consider the rent agreement when it is submitted to him.  The policy regarding accommodation is, of course, a matter for the board and the new board will be announced later this week.  In respect of the review, the terms of reference have been published.  I know that Deputies Daly, Nolan, Byrne and many others have submitted comments on it.  The terms will be finalised shortly and the review will proceed without delay.</p>  <p>  I commend the Government amendment to this motion to the House.</p></speech>

I am glad that Independents 4 Change and other Deputies are supporting it.  The motion should probably have come sooner.  When these matters were being debated in 2012, there was disagreement about how the &euro;110 million should be utilised to support survivors who were subjected to abuse over the years in State and religious institutions.  There was a suggestion that the money should be administered directly to people rather than setting up a body that creates administration costs and that sets down criteria and makes people go through processes.  It was argued that it would have been much better just to pay the survivors directly out of that fund.  Deputy Barry has raised some of these issues.  However, the Government's view in its wisdom was that Caranua should be set up.</p>  <p>  About three people have come to me over recent years because of difficulties accessing services through Caranua.  While we supported them as much as we could, we were never really able to get to the bottom of it.  I spoke today to Carmel McDonnell-Byrne, the director of the Aislinn Education and Support Centre Dublin and herself a survivor of institutional abuse.  She said that people coming to her are traumatised by the process of applying for and accessing services, explaining about themselves, why they needed the services and so on, only to be told that they could not access them.  I also want to mention Fionna Fox, a solicitor and advocate for survivors since 2015.  She originally worked for the Aislinn centre.  Everyone should read the report she wrote on survivors' dealings with Caranua.</p>  <p>  From 2015, Caranua refused to process outstanding applications and overnight hundreds of applicants were cut off from the fund.  This policy is still in force.  Caranua had no legal right to authorise the board to refuse to process applications from eligible applicants.  Certain applications are being put on indefinite hold due to the prioritisation policy.  The board does not have the authority to refuse to process applications from eligible applicants as its primary function is to accept, process and determine applications by applying the criteria set out in the guidelines.  This is a clear example of Caranua exercising its discretion in an unlawful manner.  In respect of the cap, no reasons were given for the setting of the limit at &euro;15,000, nor was any more information provided as to the reasons for the internal audits concerned.</p><p>It is not clear if the internal auditor had read the legislation governing the operation of the scheme.  Otherwise, the auditor might not have made the recommendations that defeat the primary objective of the scheme and that are <i>ultra vires</i>.<br/><br/>It is understood that Caranua commissioned an actuarial report that placed the likely number of eligible survivors who are still alive at closer to 7,000 rather than 15,000.  The number of applicants to the fund has now reached 5,500.  Only 545 applied in 2016.  No limit is allowed in the Act even if a limit were to be considered necessary.  However, given the slowdown in awards and the deadline in the number of new applicants, it is not understood why this policy is being implemented aside from a general concern that the money would run out.  This fact was known since the inception of the scheme.  In a nutshell, Ms Fox has pointed out that once the money runs out, the scheme will close.  That is a fact.<br/><br/>A total of &euro;55 million has been handed out already.  A total of &euro;5 million has gone on administration costs, contracts and so on.  Will the Minister confirm whether he cleared the contract with Mazars and other private contractors as well as the rent?  That happened last March.  We need clarification on that.<br/><br/>A key point in our motion is that there needs to be face-to-face contact.  I note that the Minister referred to face-to-face engagement but he referred to a greater level of face-to-face engagement.  We are saying there has to be face-to-face engagement.  There is no other way around this.<br/><br/>I hope Members will support the motion.  It is important that our motion goes through because it really deals with the issue.</p></speech>

The Minister suggested this was an unduly negative motion.  My reaction is to point out that is a continuation of the terrible attitude that has always in applied in this country.  It is a patronising attitude that immediately seeks to isolate the group or person who have highlighted complaints.  I have endeavoured, as have my colleagues, to make this as positive as possible.  There were calls for the resignation of the chief executive.  We endeavoured not to go down that route for the moment and rather to make it as applicable to as many people in the D&aacute;il as we could.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has failed in this regard.  I have supported many Fianna F&aacute;il motions.  I do not think the Fianna F&aacute;il Members have read my motion or the Independents 4 Change motion, which is a general motion calling for a review not only of the criteria but of the operations of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The negativity attributed to me by the Minister does not arise from me.  It arises from complaints from the survivors who are enduring abuse in our name in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister referred to teething problems.  This organisation is old enough to have molars and it still cannot cope.  It has put a stop on processing of applications from 15.  Those involved cannot answer the telephone or meet clients directly.  The organisation is acting in contravention of the legislation.  Section 7 of the relevant Act puts an onus on the board to act in accordance with the principles of equity, consistency and transparency.  I have outlined in detail how the board is failing to do that.  The board has introduced contradictory schemes.  It is treating survivors in a manner that is discriminatory.  Some are confined to a limit while others are not.  Some are confined by way of priority while others are not.</p>  <p>  The Minister and his Department have been at the least disingenuous in their responses to questions on whether they have given permission for rent.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, who is sitting beside the Minister, has come to the House and backed up the Minster.  I do not want to go down the route of personalising anything but the Minister has an obligation under the legislation to give consent to every contract, including a lease.  Will the Minister confirm whether he has given it?  Will the Minister confirm whether he gave it for the extension of the lease entered into by the Office of Public Works?</p>  <p>  Caranua appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Arising from what I heard there and from what survivors told me, my colleagues and I tabled this motion.  The purpose was not to be negative but to ensure oversight of the board primarily on the part of the Minister and his Department.  We need a proper board.  I have pointed out that the most outspoken member of the board has not been reappointed.  Since then, it has been pointed out to me that the diversity of the board has not been considered and that a person of mixed race has not been re-appointed.</p>  <p>  Numerous issues have not been addressed by either the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, or the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  It appals me.  This is why we end up with inquiries.  The Minister has a responsibility.  He should assume that responsibility.  Deputy Mattie McGrath put it in a nutshell when he asked the Minister to take control.  Control amounts to having oversight and giving crystal clear answers.  Did the Minister give permission for all the contracts?  I know the Minister did not give permission for the fitting out of new premises.  They were fitted out without consent and paid for out of the funds.  Is the Minister standing over that situation?  The organisation is going into premises at a rent of &euro;272,000 approximately per year from a fund that is in place for survivors.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to a mix-up over the hospitals.  Deputy Byrne from Fianna F&aacute;il might read the legislation.  He might also read the minutes that noted the serious concern of the board in respect of whether money would be left for the hospital.  The matter was to be clarified by the Minister.  I am glad the Minister is clarifying today that the money will not be going to the hospital.  The amount will be anything up to &euro;110 million.  What has the Minister not clarified?  What about the interest that he was asked about by other Deputies?  Is that going into a fund for the hospital?  Will it go into this fund?  Even at this late stage, I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il Members to read the motion and withdraw their amendment.  For once, let us stand together for those who need our voice to be heard in this Chamber.</p></speech>

If the paragraph remains in the Bill, it would introduce a new power of arrest without warrant by the Garda if a member was of the opinion that someone on bail was about to contravene any of his or her bail conditions and if the garda considers arrest necessary to prevent harm to, interference with, or intimidation of the alleged victim, witness or other such persons. </p><p>My concern is that effectively we are giving the Garda powers of arrest for a future crime - offences that have not been committed yet, crimes that might not be crimes at all but just a thought in a garda's head.  The potential for abuse in those circumstances is considerable, should a garda choose to be of that mind.  We did discuss this on Committee Stage.  I do not see any merits as to how it would make the victim any safer.  Having discussed it at committee, I have changed my amendment since then.  I had opposed the whole subsection, but I have taken on board the points made by other Deputies, namely, the circumstances whereby for instance, if somebody accused of a sexual crime against a woman was approaching her in her front garden, it would be a help to the woman if the garda could arrest the accused to get him out of the way and protect her.  I do not believe my amendment puts a stop to that or prevents the garda from doing that in any way.  It is only about not extending new powers of arrest without warrant for breach of bail conditions, particularly in the absence of bail supports or services, which is an issue that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has raised, saying it is a short-term and simplistic solution to what is a complex problem.  It is in that sense that I am moving it.</p></speech>

However, consider the circumstances where a victim is in fear of violence from an accused person and that person is prohibited from contacting the victim as a condition of his or her bail.  If the accused person pulls up outside the victim's house or approaches the victim in any place, the victim should not have to wait for the accused person to make contact, which may be threatening or violent, before the Garda can intervene.  The power of arrest provided in this provision has been carefully considered.  It is very limited in nature.  A person may only be arrested without warrant where a garda reasonably suspects that the person is about to breach a condition of his or her bail and the immediate arrest is necessary to prevent harm to or interference with the victim, another witness or a person that the court has specifically tried to protect.</p>  <p>  I believe the provision is reasonable, and it is necessary to allow a member of the Garda to intervene in such circumstances and consequently, I am not accepting the amendment.  </p></speech>

My point is that it is far too vague.  If a garda was present and thought that a person was in danger, he or she would have powers under existing legislation to make an arrest.  For instance, were a garda to tell someone to run along and move it, that is, were the garda to give the person a reasonable instruction to leave under section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and were that person not to comply, then the garda could arrest that person anyway under existing provisions.  Similarly, if someone was threatening to cause bodily harm to a victim under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, it would not be necessary for him or her to actually hit or stab someone for a garda to have a power of arrest in those circumstances.  Therefore I do not believe that a victim's safety is being negatively impacted upon by my amendment.  What I am trying to do is get a better balance in terms of human rights.  It is very broad to state that a garda could think of a future in his or her head where the bail conditions were about to be breached.  That is a significant power and is a lot woollier that it ought to be.  The scenario the Deputies want to protect would be better served by removing that "about to" scenario.  It lays an unfortunate precedent and it is on that basis that I move this amendment.</p></speech>

A condition of bail is imposed on the accused person.  There are grounds to reasonably suspect that the person is about to breach that condition.  Immediate arrest is necessary to prevent harm to, or interference with a victim or a witness.  A condition is imposed in the first instance, there are grounds to suspect that the person is about to breach the condition and immediate arrest is necessary to prevent harm or interference with a victim or witness.  If all these circumstances do not exist then there is no power of arrest.</p>  <p>  I think an arrest without warrant in such circumstances, where it is necessary to prevent harm to someone, is absolutely reasonable and justified.  </p></speech>

In some ways they might be seen as somewhat technical and heavy going but they are important and touch on a number of boxes.  They deal with electronic monitoring, which is being put forward as an alternative to a person being incarcerated.  While we welcome that, it is very important that there are guidelines on the use of electronic monitoring.  That is not only my concern as the European courts and data protection issues require us to do that.  I accept that electronic monitoring is a useful tool in the criminal justice system.  In Demark, for example, 60% of custodial sentences under six months are converted to electronic monitoring and intense supervision.  In Belgium, any prison sentence of less than three years is automatically commuted to electronic tagging.  I see a role for it and do not suggest it should not be used but it needs to be controlled carefully.  The purpose of my amendments is to beef up the safeguards.  </p><p>The wording of paragraph (a) is largely taken from the Council of Europe's 2014 recommendations on electronic monitoring.  The Council of Europe advises that it is necessary that a decision to electronically tag somebody on bail takes into account the offence it is alleged that the person committed.  While I have no doubt that judges would use their discretion and would apply sanctions fairly, at the same time we must tighten up provisions around duration because if we do not, delays could mean someone being tagged for a very long time that would be disproportionate to the crime.  Let us face it, the people being tagged here are people who have not actually been convicted of any crime.  The points being made about data protection are very important.  My amendment proposes to cover a couple of things.  First, I want to ensure that all of the data gathered as part of electronic monitoring is stored and processed in accordance with Data Protection Acts, and second, that the data are only used for specific purposes, namely, monitoring the compliance of the conditions imposed as part of the electronic monitoring.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 provides that the monitoring of people wearing tags will henceforth be done on a non-commercial, not-for-profit basis.  That is to prevent private security firms getting in on the gig to try and make a killing out of it.  I was surprised that there were no specific explicit safeguards on data protection either in this Bill or in the Bail Act 1997 in this day and age and in particular given the uses to which data gathered can be put in cases where tags are attached.</p><p>It is particularly surprising we have not explicitly stated it when the Council of Europe recommendation on the implementation of electronic monitoring explicitly states the use of data collected through electronic monitoring should be regulated by law.  That is what I am seeking to do here.  We live in a world where data are big business and people pay big money for them.  A person's data, particularly in these private matters, should only be used for the purposes for which they have been gathered.  If we do not do this and include these provisions, we are likely to run into problems with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which gives strong protections to the fundamental right to privacy.  It says we need a sound framework of specific principles and standards protecting the rights of individuals.  I had hoped the amendment would be accepted.  I do not see it as being particularly controversial unless we are trying to leave the door open to private commercial operators to make big bucks from the data being collected.  I do not really get it.  </p> <p> On Committee Stage, Deputies from Fine Gael said my attempt to put electronic monitoring on a not-for-profit basis was ideological.  That is funny because it is exactly what the Council of Europe states the issue is.  In its Standards and Ethics in Electronic Monitoring handbook, it says "Government decisions to use commercial organisations to deliver [electronic monitoring] are as likely to be taken on ideological grounds as on practical grounds."  There have been some problems in other states where services were being provided privately but subsequently had to be brought in under the public domain.  I am trying to ensure from the start that there would not be anybody profiting from this type of procedure.  </p> <p> I spoke on Committee Stage about the German model, which is based on de-escalation and in so far as possible, helping offenders not to breach bail conditions.  That should be the direction in which we go.  In that sense, the monitoring of tagging should be done by professional people such as social workers and people who can go in and intervene to de-escalate, not to catch people out and have them whipped off to prison.  We are trying to achieve a position where that would not happen.  There is a greater danger of that happening if it was a private for-profit operator.  I see these amendments as quite important.  </p></speech>

Its intended effect is to encourage a person on bail to comply with the conditions the court has imposed.  There are a range of safeguards to ensure it is used appropriately already in the Bail Act.  The Act requires a person subject to electronic monitoring to consent to it and the provisions only apply to adults charged with serious offences.  It is also not possible to restrict the movements of a person on bail to such an extent they must remain in any specific place or residence at all times.  It is clear that most of the conditions this amendment seeks to impose are already provided for in the Bail Act.  Imposing additional conditions on the use of electronic monitoring will simply make it more difficult to impose and will result in people being refused bail where they may otherwise be granted bail subject to electronic monitoring.  That is the impact the Deputy's amendment will have.</p>  <p>  With regard to data protection, the Deputy quoted the Council of Europe but the Data Protection Acts set out the law governing all data in any form that can be processed.  All data gathered as a result of any provision of this Bill or the Bail Act are subject to the Data Protection Acts.  It is already subject to the Data Protection Acts.  One of the features of those Acts is that personal and sensitive data may only be processed in accordance with law.  Therefore, where specific provision is made in this Bill or in the Bail Act for data to be gathered, processed and used for certain purposes and in a certain way, it is the specific provision in this Bill or the Bail Act that will apply.  Gathering, storing and processing the relevant data under the provisions of the Bail Acts is of itself complying with the Data Protection Acts.  The Deputy's concerns are ill-founded.  The Data Protection Acts already do what the Deputy is trying to do by way of amendment.  It is not necessary.  </p>  <p>  Amendment No. 4 proposes to amend section 6D and to restrict the provision of electronic monitoring services to non-commercial or not-for-profit providers.  It would prevent current arrangements used for electronic monitoring by the Prison Service.  It would restrict the possible options for providing electronic monitoring.  I do not share the Deputy's concerns that a commercial operator cannot appropriately and effectively provide the electronic monitoring service.  Such a provider would be bound to operate the service in accordance with the statutory provisions and contractual obligations imposed by the State.  Limiting the provision to non-commercial operators would restrict the available operators and possibly lead to circumstances in which electronic monitoring services could not be implemented in some locations or perhaps not at all.  It would also be likely to increase costs.  I am not inclined to accept the amendment on that basis.  </p></speech>

The first is the conditions are too cumbersome and it will mean electronic monitoring will not be selected and therefore it defeats the purpose.  I do not accept that.  The Judiciary is more than capable of balancing the requirements and the conditions I have put forward.  In many ways, it could be argued the Judiciary takes many of these measures into account anyway.  That is probably an argument that could be made.  I do not accept the idea its members would not be capable of taking on board the list of requirements in the legislation.  They are more than qualified to take a balanced view.  I do not see a problem in outlining in legislation factors they would be required to take into account which in many instances they already do.  I see them as a safety precaution in instances where the odd member of the Judiciary might not do it.</p>  <p>  I will address the Minister's point about the protection being there in terms of data in existing data protection legislation rather than criminal justice and bail legislation.  If it is, there is no problem in reiterating it here.  It is not causing any problems.  It is a case of "to be sure, to be sure" and re-emphasising the situation.  I do not see it as a particular problem.  There are issues when we look at new forms of data, particularly areas like GPS trackers and so on.  The old electronic monitoring systems operated on radio frequency monitoring whereas the new systems have been very much upgraded.  There have been some court cases and legal action around some of these issues.  As a protection of data, the amendments I have proposed to protect privacy are particularly important so we do not leave the door open for profiteering.  </p>  <p>  I feel more strenuously about amendment No. 4 because I do not see any basis for a for-profit operator to exist in this area.  It should have no part in such an important public service that could be abused.  We should take a holistic approach and de-escalate situations.  I will definitely be pressing amendment No. 4.</p></speech>

That is in circumstances where the Garda believes it would be effective in preventing breaches of bail conditions.  It has to be with the consent of the person being monitored and it only applies to adults.  There are already sufficient safeguards in place to ensure electronic monitoring will only be used where it is essential and appropriate having regard to the individual offences and to the particular circumstances of the case.  I do not agree the additional conditions contained in the amendment are necessary or helpful.</p>  <p>  On a technical note, amendment No. 3 refers to section 6B of the Act.  It should refer to section 6B of the 1997 Act.  As such, it is not inserted into the Bail Act 1997 and could not be implemented in its current form.  That is just a technical point.  </p></speech>

While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Clare Daly regarding not-for-profit organisations, I do not know if such organisations would be up to the task.</p>  <p>  As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I believe electronic tagging must be used because, as garda&iacute; have informed me, we do not have sufficient resources to physically monitor people.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question the Minister informed me that electronic tagging had been in place since the Bail Act was introduced seven years ago and the prosecution in cases involving bail applications had never applied to have the system used.  I ask her to clarify this statement because I understood electronic tagging had been applied for in the past.  Bail is not granted lightly and, as the Minister stated, if electronic tagging is not permitted, bail applications will be refused and we will clog up prison spaces with people who are under suspicion and have not been convicted.</p>  <p>  I recently visited Roscrea and other places in Tipperary where obnoxious crimes had been committed involving people travelling long distances to invade homes and attack people before wandering off into the dead of night.  A 90 year old was left traumatised having been beaten over the head with a walking stick.  There must be some way of tracing individuals who visit this kind of carnage on elderly and defenceless people.  While I understand Deputy Clare Daly's point about involving social workers to de-escalate matters, de-escalation does not apply to some people, especially those who have a large number of convictions for the same kinds of crimes.  Some semblance of sense must prevail.</p>  <p>  I have seen electronic tagging used in other jurisdictions and it saves significant police resources as it allows persons wearing the tags to be monitored from a monitoring station.  Garda&iacute; would not have to travel by squad car to visit a person for five or ten minutes in his or her home.  The person could be anywhere for the next 24 hours.  The system is outdated.  I respect human rights and I do not like big brother watching people but we have to deal with circumstances in which people are frightened for their lives in their homes.  This is making them sick and feeble and causing strokes in some cases.  People end up in hospitals and nursing homes when they should be allowed to live in dignity in their homes.  They deserve respect having worked all their lives and should be allowed to live in their homes without being terrorised by marauding gangs of thugs.  We must strengthen legislation and support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's efforts to deal with these people and get them off the streets.  They do not need compassion and social workers because many of them abuse the system.  </p></speech>

This is not an outrageous proposal.  The United States is probably the best example of practice in other jurisdictions.  It is also a wonderful example of why elements of policing, security monitoring and so forth should not be allowed to become commercial because the industry has mushroomed out of control and become self-perpetuating.  The American approach makes it attractive to do as one sees fit to create the highest profit, rather than doing what should be done by right.</p>  <p>  The amendment does not preclude the State from hiring private contractors but provides that it should be able to monitor and control private contractors and pay them for their work without being able to make extra profit by doing A, B or C.  The prison system in the United States has spiralled out of control because it was privatised.  Companies that have invested in American prisons have come almost to rival arms manufacturers when it comes to lobbying.  They are keen for changes in legislation that will result in more prisons being built and more people being sent to prison.  More than 2.5 million people are locked up in the United States.  This is an incredible figure even in the context of the country's population.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-05-24a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400050#AAA00300"><p>I agree with one aspect of Deputy Wallace's contribution.  The last thing I want is the Irish Prison Service or aspects of our criminal justice system to be privatised.  The Deputy is correct in referring to the position in the United States where it has become profitable for large companies to ensure the prison population is increased and certain preventative measures are introduced in the penal system.  However, amendment No. 4 would require that any contracts for the performance of monitoring duties entered into by the Government with private providers "shall stipulate that such activities shall be performed on a non-commercial, not-for-profit basis."  No private provider would enter into a contract on the basis that it is not for profit.  The effect of this would be that the State would have to provide the monitoring service and we would have to ensure the State would be responsible for such a service.  I do not know if the State has the capacity to do that at present, although maybe it should seek to get involved in this area in due course.  However, if we want to allow and encourage monitoring, which would benefit the applicant who is seeking bail because the alternative is that he or she will not be granted bail, this amendment would prevent it from happening.  I oppose the amendment for this reason.</p></speech>

The Deputy has them convicted and hanged.  I also remind him that the cost of incarceration is a considerable burden on taxpayers.  If we can get this system working and keep people out of prison, we will all be better off, even financially.</p>  <p>  I warn Deputies that Ireland will find itself swimming against the tide in Europe if the amendment is not accepted.  I base my view on the Council of Europe's handbook, Standards and Ethics in Electronic Monitoring, which examines different systems.  It refers, for example, to the system in place in the Netherlands, which is delivered by the public sector and run by a private organisation.  It discusses countries that are considering electronic monitoring, such as Estonia, Latvia and Croatia, none of which has a problem with public not-for-profit delivery of electronic monitoring.  The report states that the Scandinavian-Dutch-Belgian public sector model of electronic monitoring service delivery has largely prevailed in the longer term over the Anglo-Welsh preference for a privatised model.  Put another way, if we do not accept the amendment, we will be out of step with the majority of countries in Europe. </p>  <p>  My amendment takes account of the fact that some contracts for electronic monitoring may be in place with private, for-profit providers.  Some of the provisions would not kick in until these contracts are renewed and the amendment would not, as Deputy O'Callaghan stated, prevent a private company from getting involved in electronic tagging.  The State could fix a price to have a private company provide a service.  The point of the amendment is to exclude the incentive of profit being linked to the scheme.  A private company could be employed as an outsourced provider.  This is an important amendment which I intend to press.  </p></speech>
