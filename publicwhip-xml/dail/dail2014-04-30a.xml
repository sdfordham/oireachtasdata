The Government subsequently appointed retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice John Cooke, to conduct an independent inquiry into this matter.  The terms of reference for the inquiry were agreed by the Government, with the advice of the Attorney General.  Mr. Justice Cooke was asked to report within eight weeks or as soon as may be thereafter.  On 27 February 2014, the Government appointed Mr. Sean Guerin, SC, to conduct an independent inquiry into certain allegations made by Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  The Government, again with the advice of the Attorney General, agreed the terms of reference for this independent inquiry.  Mr Guerin was asked to deliver a report within eight weeks or as soon as may be thereafter.  The reports of both Mr. Justice Cooke and Mr. Guerin are currently awaited.  Their finalisation is a matter exclusively for Mr. Justice Cooke and Mr. Guerin, but I expect that they will be received shortly. </p><p>  As Deputy Niall Collins is aware, the Government at its meeting of 25 March 2014 reiterated its commitment to the reform of Garda oversight and accountability, which will include the establishment of an independent Garda authority appropriate to Ireland&rsquo;s needs and which will maintain appropriate democratic accountability to the Oireachtas.  The Government will bring forward the full detail of its comprehensive reform proposals in the coming months following the completion of the current inquiries by Mr. Justice Cooke and Mr. Guerin, the forthcoming hearings by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the law relating to GSOC, and the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is currently under way under the Haddington Road agreement.  That process will be assisted by the new Cabinet committee on justice reform, which had its first meeting on Monday.</p></reply>

On a number of occasions the shocking case of Ms Cynthia Owen has been raised in the House.  The legal representative, Gerry Dunne, wrote to the Taoiseach on 24 February and I believe that correspondence has been referred to the Minister.  Having listened to some of the circumstances in detail it possibly merits its own independent inquiry.  Should Mr. Guerin recommend a commission of investigation, does the Minister believe the circumstances of the Cynthia Owen case could be examined under a broader independent inquiry under the commission of investigation, be it a separate one or one which emanates from the Guerin inquiry?</p><p>  Separately, I received the Minister's correspondence relating to Ms Lucie O'Farrell.  I put a note of thanks on the record in that regard.  I have noted his response stating that he will meet her later.</p></speech>

I cannot and will not prejudge the outcome of the inquiry being conducted.  The whole purpose was to refer the issues that were raised by Sergeant McCabe, about which the Deputy and his party leader made a variety of comment, for independent examination.  Mr. Guerin will conduct that independent examination.</p><p>  Regarding the very tragic background and circumstances of Ms Cynthia Owen, I believe that is the subject matter of a parliamentary question before me today.  If I am not correct in that, I know for certain it is the subject of a Topical Issue debate to be taken at approximately 4.15 p.m. or 4.20 p.m. this afternoon.  I will address that matter appropriately when it arises.</p></speech>

However, why did he not send a Minister of State or another Minister to engage with the Garda sergeants and inspectors who were present?  Why for the second year in a row did the Garda Representative Association not invite the Minister to attend its conference?</p></reply>

I was also scheduled to attend a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, 15 April regarding my duties as Minister for Defence.  My difficulties were explained to the general secretary of the AGSI and, while he was understandably disappointed, I believe he understood the position in which I found myself.  Officials from my Department attended and the question of arranging for a replacement speaker to make an address on my behalf did not arise.  I also wrote to the general secretary of the AGSI expressing my regret at not being able to attend and also recording my appreciation for the service that his members and indeed all garda&iacute; provide on a daily basis in countering crime and maintaining the security of the State.</p><p>  I greatly value continued engagement with the AGSI and the other Garda representative bodies on a wide range of policing issues.  In this context I have since received a very constructive letter from the general secretary of the AGSI on the case for the widest possible level of consultation on the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I will carefully consider his views. </p><p>  I did not receive an invitation to attend the GRA conference in Killarney this week.  I did not receive an invitation to attend its conference last year either.  It is of course entirely a matter for the GRA to decide whom it wishes to invite to its conference and how it should conduct its business, but again I want to make clear that I favour positive engagement with the Garda representative bodies on policing issues.  I would be more than happy to meet representatives of the GRA or the other Garda associations at any time.  We certainly should be able to have a frank, open and constructive discussion on policing matters, particularly at a time of significant policing reform, and I look forward to that engagement.</p><p>  It is a time for review and reform in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and pursuant to the Haddington Road agreement issues relating to the efficiency, effectiveness, structure organisation, staffing and deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are being addressed.  I look forward to the positive and constructive engagement of the Garda associations in that process.</p></speech>

Can he give me further information on how it did not arise?  When was he invited?  On what date did he receive the invite to attend the AGSI conference?  When did he become aware of a clash?  What arrangements could he have made to send another Minister?  Apparently, many years ago, the Minister of the day could not attend but another attended in his place.  Yesterday the GRA president made the point that what really got to its members was the spin where the Government announced it had put in place hundreds of new Garda vehicles, but what it did not say was that hundreds more had been taken off the road.  The GRA president spoke about the fact that there was no real consultation with its members.  Does the Minister agree that it is now at crisis point where not only has he not been invited to engage with the GRA for a second year in a row but when the ASGI invites him, he does not even send a replacement Minister?</p></speech>

His concern is very touching, but it is also hypocritical as he spent most of the first four months of the year denigrating members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this House.</p></speech>

He was clearly referencing Members opposite.  I said and say again that I welcome constructive engagement with various Garda associations.  Since becoming Minister, I have attended the 2012 and 2013 AGSI annual conferences.  I have attended all of the annual conferences of Garda superintendents and attended one GRA conference until in the midst of the issues of controversy that arose relating to Croke Park II, it determined not to invite me.  I regret that I was not invited this year.  However, I draw to the Deputy's attention that in August 2012 I invited the GRA to discuss issues of mutual interest, but this invitation was not taken up.  In January 2013 my Department asked by email if the GRA proposed to send a request for a meeting in advance of the annual delegate meeting, but the GRA did not respond to this e-mail and, subsequently, it determined not to invite me to the conference.  I met the AGSI in October 2012.  Earlier this year we received a request for a meeting from it which I hope will take place in the not too distant future; therefore, I am quite happy to engage with the Garda associations on a constructive basis.  </p><p>  I reiterate that we are in a time of political change and, when it comes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, reform and renewal.  It is of particular importance that there be direct engagement.  I am presuming the Garda associations will, as I know they will, all contribute to the review under the Haddington Road agreement.  I will write to them to ask them to furnish to the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with justice issues which is focusing particularly on the establishment of a police authority their submissions on the creation of a police authority, its structure and powers and appointments to it.  I look forward to constructive engagement in the coming months and hope each of the Garda associations will approach matters in a similar way.</p></speech>

It is everybody else's fault but his - everybody else is denigrating members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Nobody buys that.  Garda&iacute; at the coalface have lost confidence in the Minister.  They have listened to the spin around efficiency, modernisation and smart policing to justify all the cutbacks and failures to engage.  The situation has reached this point and still the Minister looks over at the Opposition benches to try to find blame.  The Minister should look in the mirror.  That is where the blame lies.  He should deal with that.</p></speech>

In the meantime, the Deputy stayed extraordinarily quiet when one of his colleagues, who sits behind him in this House, greeted some of those members with whom his party was associated upon their release for being involved in the death of Detective Garda McCabe.  The Deputy should make up his mind what the narrative is, whether he is critical on a daily basis of the garda&iacute;, supportive of them or just willing to spin whatever line he thinks will get him on the broadcast media or get a headline.  The reality is we need to take the politics out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If there is a problem with morale, it is because of the daily onslaught in this House by members of the Opposition on members of the Garda force where there have been difficulties within the force.  The Garda Inspectorate report set out those difficulties.  It was a report I sought, but when the report was published, Members opposite me sought to smear every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with having been engaged in wrongdoing, and then they accused me of behaving in a manner that impacts on the morale of the force.</p></speech>

From the outset I should clarify that as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no role in authorising surveillance under the provisions of the 2009 Act.  Under the Act, authorisations for surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances described in the Act.</p><p>  The Act provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a member of the Defence Forces or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners shall carry out surveillance only in accordance with a valid authorisation.  In that regard, an application for a valid authorisation must be made by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a judge of the District Court where the officer is of the opinion that, as part of an operation or investigation being conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning an arrestable offence, the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purposes of obtaining information as to whether the offence has been committed or as to the circumstances relating to the commission of the offence, or obtaining evidence for the purposes of proceedings in relation to the offence; the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission of arrestable offences; or the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State.</p><p>  Exceptionally in accordance with section 7 of the Act, an authorisation may be granted without recourse to the District Court in very limited circumstances described in the Act where grounds of urgency exist.  In this regard the designated judge appointed to oversee the operation of the Act under section 12 has noted, in his most recent report to the Taoiseach, that the specific procedures in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for dealing with section 7 concerning urgent applications provide that the use of that section should only be availed of where an authorisation cannot be obtained from a District Court judge.</p><p>The report of the designated judge, which must be submitted on an annual basis to the Taoiseach, is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> In the performance of his statutory role, the designated judge has unimpeded access to all documentation and personnel relevant to this legislation.  In his most recent report, he commented favourably on his experiences in his dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and particularly in respect of the standard of record keeping where these matters are concerned.  The designated judge concludes that the use of the legislation remains an important asset in the fight against criminal and terrorist activity.</p></speech>

He has not answered the questions that were tabled.  A judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in January 2014 in the case of DPP v. Idah gives us one worrying example of Garda abuse of this section 7 power to internally authorise itself to undertake covert surveillance.  As a result of an invalid approval provided by the garda in question in inappropriate circumstances, which were not urgent, the evidence obtained was deemed inadmissible and the conviction was quashed by the court.  Has the Minister any intention of introducing legislation to reform this area and, in particular, to provide for proper oversight and monitoring to ensure the rights of citizens under the Constitution and under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, are adequately protected?  Will he consider extending these covert surveillance powers to GSOC in order that it may be on an equal investigatory footing with the Garda?  The principle was set out as far back as 2001 in a British case, Jordan <i>v. </i>UK, taken in the European Court of Human Rights under which oversight bodies must have the same powers as those they are trying to investigate.</p><p>The big issue for the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in the context of covert surveillance is there is not sufficient external oversight of what garda&iacute; do.  They are a law unto themselves and the current legislation provides for this.  The system is open to abuse because it is not properly checked or monitored.  There is no external monitoring worth talking about.  The Minister needs to legislate to reform the present structure.</p></speech>

I have only referenced the role of the designated judge and the reports that are published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  He may also wish to note that in addition to independent judicial oversight by a designated judge of the High Court, a complaints mechanism is provided for in the legislation whereby any individual who believes he or she has been the victim of improper use of the legislation may have the complaint investigated by a complaints referee.   Finally, I wish to advise him in the context of the original question he raised that there are considerable sensitivities around the provision of technical information of the nature sought by him and that it is not the practice for obvious security reasons to reveal details of equipment in use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling serious crime and terrorism.</p><p>  Should there be in the light of the case law of our courts any need to amend the legislation in any respect, I have no difficulty, in the context of the legislation that will clearly be required in implementing any reforms arising out of the deliberations of the Cabinet committee on justice dealing with the police authority, the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality dealing with matters relating to GSOC and the deliberations being undertaken pursuant to the Haddington Road agreement on the structure and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, incorporating any required reforms in a new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill that may be published later this year.</p></speech>

We do not even know if that system works.  We asked how many complaints have been made under it.  People cannot complain unless they know they are being bugged and they do not have access to the information that the other side has.  The Minister cannot prove this system is functioning unless he gives us the statistics.  We are not looking for information that will expose the Garda.  The use of tracking devices under section 8 of the 2009 Act never requires external authorisation or judicial oversight.  I do not think e-mail surveillance is covered by the legislation.  Will the Minister confirm whether it is or not?  The IHRC has said gaps in the legislation relating to Garda covert surveillance have significant implications for the protection of the right to privacy.  Citizens do not know what garda&iacute; are allowed to do in the area of surveillance.</p><p> The Government has an obligation to provide legal clarity.  There is such a thing as providing legal certainty, foreseeability and accessibility for Irish citizens.  Does the Minister insist on keeping people in the dark and not having any oversight or monitoring of how the force works?  The force is going one way in terms of credibility with the public, which is downhill, and the Minister is not addressing the issues.</p></speech>

As I said to the Deputy, the Act provides for the appointment of the complaints referee to investigate applications from persons who believe they might be the subject of an authorisation under the legislation.  The Act does not require a person to know if he or she was in fact the subject of an authorisation but only that he or she might have been.</p><p>  The function of the complaints referee is to investigate, unless he or she believes the application is frivolous or vexatious, whether an authorisation was used and if so whether there was contravention of the Act.  Carrying out these functions the referee will have access to any relevant cases, authorisations or other documents.  If the referee finds there has been a contravention he or she will notify the applicant accordingly, report the findings to the Taoiseach and may quash the authorisation and recommend the payment of compensation.</p><p>  In the context of engaging in regular police work there are substantial provisions for oversight.  Let me extend an invitation to the Deputy.  If there are particular legislative changes he believes are required, in the context of the review now taking place and having a new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill before the House by the end of the year, I have no difficulty in inviting the Deputy to furnish to me the particular amendments he would like to see made to the legislation where he states it falls short of providing adequate oversight.</p><p>  It is of particular importance to remember in the context of dealing with organised crime, gangland crime, international crime and a range of areas in the context of subversion and terrorism that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available to it the best possible technical assistance to ensure those who engage in criminality and pose a serious threat to the community and to life and limb can be fully and properly investigated, appropriate preventative action can be taken and, where a crime has been committed, matters can be fully and properly investigated.</p><p>  The Deputy should never forget or lose sight of one particular issue, that ultimately one of the bastions of protection of citizens of the State are the provisions contained in the Constitution and the oversight exercised by our courts with regard to these matters.  Should the Garda fail to properly comply with powers conferred on it and violate people's constitutional rights the courts provide substantial oversight to ensure the protection of citizens in the country.  On occasions this has been lost sight of in the debates which have taken place.</p></speech>

Apart from the fact that those involved are taking each other out in broad daylight, often in front of children, it impacts along the food chain.  We see the activities taking place on O'Connell Street in Dublin, on the Luas and along the boardwalk, including drug dealing.  It goes down along the criminality food chain emanating from gangland.  In addition, we had another example in my constituency this week in Kildimo on the N69 in County Limerick, where a body was thrown from a car in broad daylight and unfortunately the car coming along behind it rolled over it.  Will the Minister comment on where we are going?</p></reply>

While any shooting incident, or an incident such as that the Deputy illustrated, is a cause of great concern, to speak of a surge is misleading and alarmist in the context of falling crime rates, which the Deputy chooses to ignore, and the ongoing impact the Garda is having on organised crime.  In particular, the organised criminal activity which gives rise to this violence is being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across a number of fronts, including through the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the serious and organised crime unit and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>While the challenges posed by gangland and organised crime remain clear to all, week in week out An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making arrests and bringing persons before the courts with substantial sentences handed down in many instances.  In recent weeks, there have been significant outcomes from a number of Garda operations against criminal gangs including a carefully planned and co-ordinated strike to dismantle a major drugs gang, which led to the arrest of nine persons and the seizure of drugs with an estimated value of more than &euro;5 million.</p><p> These law enforcement operations are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures that are being fully utilised by  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have, however, made it clear repeatedly that I will look positively at any legislative suggestions the Garda Commissioner may wish to make that would render the efforts more effective.  I also draw Members' attention to the legislation currently before the Oireachtas to provide for the establishment of a DNA database to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime.  This is an initiative of huge significance and will substantially assist the Garda in the investigation of a wide range of crimes, including homicide and firearms offences.</p><p> The crime figures show that those involved in criminal gangs are being opposed robustly. I am determined that these efforts will be vigorously maintained and the Government and I will continue to provide every possible support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to confront criminals and keep communities safe.</p></speech>

It must be kept as a priority and Members must keep a focus on it in this Chamber.  In his reply, the Minister made reference to the Garda Commissioner and he earlier referred to the fact that the new Cabinet sub-committee has met.  Leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in this area in particular, is most relevant and with regard to the recruitment process for the Garda Commissioner, it was announced in this Chamber that it would be an open competition.  The Minister should outline when it will commence.  The Minister also stated it would be worldwide.  Who will conduct the search and who will screen the applications?  Who will conduct the interviews and when will the appointment be made?  The leading person in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the fight against gangland crime and all crime obviously is the Garda Commissioner.  Can the Minister provide Members with information on the recruitment process?  In an allied issue I have raised with the Minister previously regarding the current vacancies at deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner level, that interviews were held in which the former Garda Commissioner was central.  Does this interview process still stand as valid?  In other words, will the recommendations of that interview process still hold or will it be conducted subsequent to the recruitment of a new Garda Commissioner?</p></speech>

The context of the question he has tabled to me deals with the issue of homicides.  While even one homicide is one too many and consequently, none of us ever should be complacent in those areas, it is interesting to consider the background reality, that is, the context of the alarmist presentation the Deputy makes.  As the Deputy is aware, in 12 out of the 14 crime categories, the level of crime has fallen on an annualised basis and is down on a year-on-year basis.  This applies equally in the context of homicides generally.  It is worth noting that in 2006, there were 138 homicides in the State while in the annual period ending 31 December 2013, there were 80 homicides in the State.  There has been a considerable reduction in the numbers of homicides.  This is not to state that any homicide or any murder of any individual is acceptable, even if it occurs in respect of individuals who are known to be engaged in criminality.  While the Garda investigates these matters to great effect, as the Deputy is aware there are considerable difficulties in the context of dealing with gangland crime.  There are gangs engaged in this State in the drug trade that are at war with one another.  There are subversive organisations that have fragmented and that are at war with one another and, as a consequence and tragically, life is being lost.  However, the Garda is committed to and dedicated to investigating each and every such event.  However, I implore the Deputy to please not be alarmist and opportunistic in this area for political reasons.</p></speech>

The reality is there has been an enormous reduction in homicides between 2006 and 2013.  Moreover, there has been a substantial reduction in every area of crime when it is examined in the context of the very statistics that are being produced.</p></speech>

The business community in this town has extended an invitation to the Minister to step out of his ivory tower, to walk down O'Connell Street and the side streets off O'Connell Street, to take a trip on the Luas, to walk along the boardwalk and to witness what is going on.  There is no point in being in denial about it and trying to throw it back at me by saying that I am being alarmist.  I am articulating what I have been told factually and I am not making it up.  The Minister may quote statistics and I agree they are trending in the right direction.  He should move away from trying to play politics with the issue.  He should come out of his ivory tower, step out of his Department and bring some of his officials with him, the guys who would not go down and talk to the GRA.  He should step out into the real world and take a look at it.  He might educate himself and he might come to realise that what we are saying is the case.  We are not playing politics with the issue and we are legitimately raising it here.</p><p>  My question to the Minister about the recruitment process for the Garda Commissioner is linked and is relevant.  I will ask him another related question about gangland behaviour because members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are targeted.  A bomb was laid at the door of a garda in Leitrim.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been assaulted.  The GRA has reported up to 1,000 assaults.  My party tabled a Bill to provide for a minimum mandatory sentence of five years for anyone who seriously assaults an emergency worker and the Government rejected the Bill.  The Minister said at the time that the Government intended to bring forward proposals.  What will the Minister do to protect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na against assaults by gangland people and figures and by those engaged in criminality?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, this has been an issue for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the force.  The criminal law includes specific legislation to deal with assaults or threats to assault emergency workers, including garda&iacute;, and this is contained in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Strong penalties are provided for these offences, including fines and prison terms of up to 12 months on summary conviction and up to seven years on indictment.  This is worth noting in the context of these provisions.</p><p>  The CSO figures for the number of recorded instances of offences under section 19 against all emergency workers was 330 in 2012 and 309 in 2011.  Not all such instances would be recorded as section 19 offences.  It is important that the risks faced by garda&iacute; are managed and mitigated through appropriate operational procedures and supported by training and effective equipment.  I assure the Deputy that these concerns are fully appreciated and subject to ongoing monitoring and development by the Garda Commissioner and her management team.  Specific operational arrangements are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance.</p></speech>

This assistance is usually sought and provided on a confidential basis, as any public comment relating to a request for assistance may prejudice or impair the investigation giving rise to the making of a request.  However, in this instance, given that a certain amount of information is already in the public domain, I think it appropriate to make some comment in the matter.  While the European arrest warrant proceedings were before the Supreme Court, on 25 October 2012, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the central authority of my Department enclosing a copy of an analysis prepared in the DPP's office of the evidence gathered in the investigation and directions in the matter from November 2001.</p><p>This matter was raised immediately with the Attorney General, who advised that copies of the documentation should be furnished to both the legal representatives of Mr. Ian Bailey and the French authorities, and this was done.  Separately, on 4 November, the Director of Public Prosecutions, at the request of the Attorney General, forwarded some other records to Mr. Bailey's legal representatives.  At the request of the DPP's office, the central authority forwarded this documentation to the French authorities.  I was subsequently informed that, prior to the completion of the European arrest warrant proceedings before the Supreme Court, the documentation in question had formed the basis of a complaint on Mr. Bailey's behalf to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  It was not necessary for me, therefore, to use my powers to refer the material to the commission on the conclusion of the Supreme Court case as it was my understanding that the matter was already before it. </p><p> I should also mention the issue of assistance being afforded to the French authorities in the investigation they are carrying out into the death of Ms du Plantier.  This has been provided on an ongoing basis in the light of Ireland's legal obligations, reflected in various international co-operation instruments and domestic legislation.  The French authorities have sought further assistance and this is under consideration at present.  Correspondence has been received from the legal representatives of a person regarding the continued provision of mutual legal assistance in this case.  The French authorities were informed in early April, including through correspondence between me and my French counterpart, that material - the tapes to which the Deputy referred - had emerged in the context of a related civil case.  Given these circumstances, legal advice has been sought on the request for further assistance.</p><p> I assure the House that should new evidence come to light in relation to the brutal and tragic killing of Ms du Plantier, it will be pursued fully.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda investigation into her death is part of the terms of reference in the commission of investigation to be conducted by Mr. Justice Fennelly.</p></speech>

On three subsequent occasions, the legal representatives of Mr. Ian Bailey corresponded with the Minister on the failure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to fully co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in respect of documentation.  As the Minister is aware, a similar issue arose the following year when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission expressed grave reservations in its public interest investigation into what became known as the Kieran Boylan affair.  The Minister subsequently pulled together the Garda Commissioner and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and introduced new protocols for co-operation.  Why did he not take similar action in the Ian Bailey case when Mr. Bailey's legal representatives raised these matters with him the previous year?  The Minister stated at that point that he would consult the Attorney General.  When the Attorney General learned of the tapes in the Ian Bailey case in November 2013, why did she not immediately inform the Minister about them?</p></speech>

I dealt with the matter as was appropriate and correct in the context of the legal position.  I will not reprise matters now that will be fully dealt with in the commission of inquiry that is being conducted.</p></speech>

According to media reports, the French authorities with an interest in the Bailey case have requested permission to visit Ireland again.  I understand the Minister has received correspondence from Mr. Bailey's legal representatives which sets out three grounds on which he should refuse the request.  They also ask that the Minister respond by outlining his position on the matter.  Is it not outrageous that a damning critique is available which tears apart the Garda investigation and shows no evidence that Mr. Ian Bailey was connected to the tragic murder of Ms du Plantier?  I refer to evidence from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and a decision by our highest court, the Supreme Court.  Despite this, the Department continues to defend a case and will not give an assurance that the request by the French authorities will be refused.</p><p>If this were permitted, it would show contemptible disrespect for our criminal justice system.  Will the Minister state categorically that he will not permit the French authorities to come into this jurisdiction, considering all that has emerged about this case and is in the public domain?</p></speech>

I have already explained to him that within days of the document from the DPP - that apparently was created in 2001 - becoming known to me and becoming available, it was furnished to both Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s lawyers and to the French authorities.  The French authorities are aware of the content of that document.  I explained to the Deputy in my initial response that the State has certain legal obligations with regard to matters that arise in the context of the form of investigation being conducted by the French authorities.  I have explained to the Deputy that, in light of developments that have taken place and in the context of correspondence I have received, legal advice is being sought.  I have to act as a Minister lawfully with accordance with legal advice that is furnished to me.</p><p>  I am also conscious, as the Deputy is aware, that matters relating to the manner in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dealt with issues concerning Mr. Bailey are before GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  There are also civil proceedings, taken by Mr. Bailey, currently before the courts.  Accordingly, I cannot say anything in this House that impacts or impinges on those proceedings.  I assure the Deputy that I am conscious of all the issues he has raised.  I have to act as Minister on legal advice that I obtain.  I have sought legal advice and am awaiting receipt of it with regard to the correspondence most recently received and referenced by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Archbishop Desmond Tutu does not share the Minister&rsquo;s opinion in this regard.  He, along with the former UN assistant secretary general Denis Halliday and Afri, have recently called again for an urgent and comprehensive independent inquiry into the policing of the Corrib gas project.  Will the Minister finally bow to political public pressure and order an independent GSOC inquiry under section 106 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 or will he wait until the matter escalates into another full-blown wholesale fiasco as he did with the penalty points and other issues?</p></reply>

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the western region into the Belmullet district.  It is deeply regrettable that so much Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location.  However, this is absolutely necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom, as I have said previously, are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder, as well as damage to property.  Indeed between 2011 and 2013, 38 defendants were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on garda&iacute;.  Such actions cannot be tolerated.  The aim of the policing measures in place is to prevent public order offences and to ensure people can go about their lawful business.</p><p>  Regarding my powers under section 106 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, I must point out that GSOC has investigated 124 complaints against members of the force arising from policing at this location and that other matters remain under investigation by it.  The Deputy may wish to note, however, that in excess of 100 of these complaints have either been found by GSOC to be inadmissible or not to have disclosed breaches of discipline on the part of the members complained of.  Those that did indicate a breach of discipline on the part of the Garda member concerned related to the behaviour of the individual member rather than practices, policies or procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given these circumstances, I do not see a necessity for an independent inquiry into the policing operation in north County Mayo.</p><p>  The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16 million.  This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have performed duties at the Corrib gas project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.</p></reply>

GSOC is currently involved in a section 98 investigation into the delivery of alcohol to Belmullet Garda station in 2007.  Section 106 was drafted to address the precise type of systemic policing issues relating to practices, policies and procedures that have arisen in Corrib.  Rank and file garda&iacute; would get due process and fair procedures under a section 106 investigation.  Individual garda&iacute; would not run the risk of being scapegoated for implementing the aggressive and targeted policing policy that is being pursued in Corrib.  The policy to which I refer was decided on at a much more senior level within the Garda and the political structure.  A section 106 investigation is the only type of investigation that has the potential to get to the bottom of this issue at all levels of the force.  There is no point in hanging the foot soldiers.  The decision makers who sent decent garda&iacute; to behave in a poor and aggressive manner need to be held to account.  Only a section 106 investigation will do that.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 sets out the various mechanisms that are available to examine or inquire into malpractice in the Garda.  As the Deputy knows, GSOC can initiate an investigation of a general nature if it considers it appropriate to do so.  As I have indicated to the Deputy previously, the Garda has passed the allegations relating to alcohol to GSOC, which is entirely independent in the context of investigating these matters.  It is not for me to express a view on the various public comments that have been made about policing in this area.  All I can say to the Deputy, who dismissively said that money does not matter, is that Garda expenditure of &euro;16 million on overtime matters considerably.</p><p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn spoke earlier about Garda resources.  In the three years prior to my appointment as Minister, the outgoing Government contributed &euro;5 million towards the purchase of Garda vehicles.  During the three years I have spent as Minister, we have made &euro;18 million available for the purchase of Garda vehicles.  We could purchase twice as many vehicles for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if it were not necessary to maintain a continuing Garda security operation at this location.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned complaints that have been made about misbehaviour or alleged misconduct by members of the Garda force.  As the Deputy knows from the information I have given, a substantial number of complaints have been considered by GSOC.  A great many of them have not been upheld.  If GSOC's investigation of a complaint validates the allegation of misconduct, I am sure GSOC will reach that conclusion.  More than any of us, GSOC has an insight into the nature of what is being alleged against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  GSOC could initiate a general inquiry under section 102 if it determined that such an inquiry was appropriate, but it has not sought to do that.</p><p>  I will conclude by mentioning that when the Deputy comes into this House, he constantly throws out a whole range of allegations.  The complaints that have been made substantially relate to the rank and file members of the force whom the Deputy pretends to wish to protect in this House.  The Deputy should substantiate or withdraw the wide-ranging allegation he has made against senior members of the Garda force with regard to the tactics being deployed at Corrib.</p></speech>

The Minister seems to love misquoting me.  I did not say &euro;16 million did not matter - I said it was "a separate issue".  The Minister has loved misquoting me for nearly two years now.  Can the Minister explain why GSOC asked to be allowed to investigate the Corrib issues under section 106?  Can he tell me why 111 complaints were received from one area?  He has said that most of them were inadmissible.  In how many of these cases did garda&iacute; investigate themselves?  All of this keeps going back to the lack of oversight and proper monitoring of any kind of external opinion.</p><p>While out of one side of his mouth the Minister says GSOC is wonderful, he keeps undermining and challenging it and refusing to allow it the extra power to use section 106 to investigate practices, policies and procedures.  The Minister is limiting GSOC.  It is he who cowed it into backing down on the bugging allegations with his outrageous misreporting.</p></speech>

It is typical that he has circled the wagons.  Although he said he did not want to comment on public order, that is precisely what he did.  His answer was completely one-sided on the protestors.  He said nothing about the alcohol situation.  Could the Minister address the fact that alcohol delivery by a business and Shell to garda&iacute; is being investigated now but has already been the subject of two internal Garda inquiries, which reported that there was no case to answer?  The only reason it is being investigated now, despite the fact that the evidence was given to the Department a long time ago, is that an English journalist has put the spotlight on the situation.  Again, external pressures are the lever to call the Minister and the Garda to account rather than a genuine question of reform.</p></speech>

Of these complaints, GSOC deemed 37 to be inadmissible.  That left 87 admissible cases of which 85 are closed.  The following is a breakdown of 57 complaints directly linked to the Shell to sea protest.  There were 33 allegations of assault; 17 cases of abuse of authority; three of discreditable conduct; two of discourtesy; and two of neglect of duty.  The remaining 30 complaints do not appear to relate directly to the protest, for example, a person driving home having participated in a protest at the Corrib gas site who was stopped by a garda and who subsequently made a complaint about the manner in which he or she was dealt with.  There were no adverse findings in these cases.  Some seven files out of the 124 were forwarded to the DPP for consideration, and the DPP directed no prosecution in all seven.  These are all GSOC investigations.  Disciplinary proceedings were recommended in 16 cases under section 95 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></speech>

Many of the people of Erris suffered during that period for standing up and confronting a profound injustice to the people of that community and this State in terms of the revenue that was attained from it.  The Minister is aware that the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, among many others, is part of an increasing call for an investigation into these matters.  GSOC found that the superintendent in charge should face disciplinary measures.  The Garda Commissioner failed to enact that, without any explanation.</p><p> We are considering GSOC powers and looking to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legislation, which is coming before the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, so does the Minister believe it appropriate for complaints to be investigated by officers who have served with other officers under investigation?

In the context of the review of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, there are a range of worthwhile reforms which could be made regarding statutory revisions in respect of GSOC.  It was created under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and we have almost nine years of experience of GSOC's operations.  I look forward with expectation to what the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality may propose.  One of the key issues is whether GSOC would conduct all the investigations that arise when it receives a complaint.  It is an issue that is not divorced from the matter of resources and the number of individuals who may be employed by the commission to investigate matters.  I invite the committee in its consideration to estimate the financial implications for resources of making such a proposal in light of financial circumstances in which the State remains.  In an ideal world I would agree with the Deputy, as it would be preferable for all investigations of complaints to be conducted by a body with oversight.  That is not what the statutory provision provides for, but ultimately it is for GSOC to determine which complaints it has received pursuant to the statutory provisions it should investigate and which complaints it should request to be investigated by a member of the force.</p></speech>

Such a prosecution is still taking place and it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment on matters which are the subject of proceedings, either civil or criminal, in another jurisdiction.  If the Deputy has any information regarding unlawful activity in this jurisdiction, the appropriate course of action is for her to furnish that information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which can then properly assess and act on it, as appropriate.</p><p>  With regard to future legislation, a criminal justice Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme which will transpose EU Directive 2013/40/EU on attacks against information systems.</p><p>The Bill will create a range of offences to protect information systems and data from illegal access and interference.  The definition of &lsquo;information system&rsquo; in the directive is extremely wide and will encompass modern communications systems.

He should be aware that shortly after he took office the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme furnished serious information which revealed, without any question or doubt, that substantial amounts of information were emanating from the Dublin offices of News International.  The office was presided over by a Ukrainian individual, Alex Marunchak, who had MI5 clearance and operated with MI6.  He was very close to Fianna F&aacute;il and the previous Government.</p><p>  This individual is now the subject of criminal charges of phone hacking in Britain.  The evidence is unequivocal that he has employed a network of hackers to gain information illegally to be presented in a slanted way, and, in the Irish context, a politically motivated way, targeting Mary McAleese and Peter Hain.  If the Minister does not think it is a matter for investigation that this news outlet operated in this city, around the corner from Leinster House, and had very close relationships with the previous Government, particularly Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s Administration, he needs to look more deeply into it because these matters involve massive breaches of privacy.  The Minister must contrast his non-response with the response of the British Government in that regard.</p></speech>

I am advised the Garda received no complaint regarding the matters the Deputy raises.</p><p>  I take with great seriousness the breach by any news media of individuals&rsquo; privacy, and any action that could detrimentally impact on the lives of individuals, particularly where the information is false or is obtained and contrived to be put into a narrative to do individuals down.  I take that with the greatest of seriousness, as I do, in particular, aspects of information that might impact on people&rsquo;s private family life, or tragedies that occur in their lives.</p><p>  In the context of matters being criminally prosecuted in Britain I will not say anything &ndash; and I ask the Deputy to be cautious in how she articulates these matters in this House &ndash; that could prejudice issues before the British courts, and which could be interpreted as so doing, to the benefit of individuals who are facing serious criminal charges.  I will not say anything in this House that could be so interpreted.</p><p>  If there are issues of illegality and if there is an investigation that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should  conduct in this context, a formal complaint needs to be made to the Garda.  If the English authorities are investigating issues effectively, with the result that appropriate individuals are being brought before the courts it is for the Garda to determine whether to leave these matters to the British police or if there are matters to be investigated separately in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  If the Deputy has information about News International or any media outlet in this State infiltrating the telecommunications systems, e-mail or telephone, of any individual in this State I ask her to furnish it to me and I will furnish it to the Garda and request that it consider the matter with a view to its investigation.</p></speech>

Very serious information has been given to the relevant authorities.</p><p>It is without dispute in my mind.  The Minister is deliberately confusing matters because we are saying without fear of contradiction this individual, who is before the courts in Britain, was a well-known figure in media circles in Dublin.  He was known to the Garda special branch and connected with senior politicians and alleged security journalists.  He had a string of informants who were also used by the Garda.  It is relevant to ask for an examination of News International's database here, including its payments records, for details of who was paid and who was hacked, and to establish the nature of the relationship between News International and its informants.  There is a crossover with Garda informants and it is relevant to ask whether or how the Garda was involved in this.</p><p> I am delighted that the Minister wants the information because he will get it, although I am surprised he asked because I think his Department already has the information.</p></speech>

We have seen in Britain, and rightly so, that an effective investigation into conduct that was outrageous produced a detailed report, with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar, in regard to the manner in which the privacy of public and private individuals was invaded.

I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the first half of this year, if possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  It has unfortunately not been possible to progress this legislation as quickly as I had hoped due to other legislative imperatives.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because in the eyes of the law a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.  Of particular importance is section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution and provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In exercising its jurisdiction under section 2 of the Act, a court is required to take into account any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.  In addition, section 6 of the Act provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences are committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  While the primary aim of the proposed bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I am taking the opportunity in this legislation to seek, as far as is possible within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.</p></speech>

Does he accept there is general concern about the adequacy of bail laws to do the job for which they were intended, particularly in the context of modern crime and the degree to which organised criminals appear to be able to circumnavigate the bail laws?  Is his Department concerned about the degree to which people who are on bail have managed to reoffend, in some cases more than twice?</p></speech>

I have concerns about the number of occasions on which some individuals find themselves before the courts while they are on bail pending the hearing of their cases.  There are individuals who commit a series of offences between the time they are first charged and granted bail and when they are finally prosecuted.  The courts have within their armoury mechanisms for dealing with that issue because it is also frequently the case that subsequent prosecutions are initiated against individuals who have offended while on bail prior to their first charge being determined.  The courts have within their armoury the possibility of imposing consecutive sentences rather than concurrent sentences.  This is a matter for judicial discretion.  The courts are independent in the manner in which they approach these issues.  Some people take the view that if the Judiciary used the option of consecutive sentencing more frequently where individuals commit offences while on bail, it might reduce the incentive for some individuals to continue to offend.  However, that is a matter for the courts and the Judiciary, which is independent in making these decisions.  It is a matter for judges to consider when dealing with individual cases involving a multiplicity of prosecutions against individuals who have committed alleged offences while in the community on bail.</p></speech>

The fact that someone has previously abused his or her position while on bail, as I understand it,  cannot under our constitutional system and the European Court of Human Rights lead a court automatically to the conclusion that he or she should be automatically denied bail if charged at a later stage because it is assumed he or she would again offend while on bail.  We are examining the bail laws with a view to deciding what we can do within the constitutional parameters and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights to ensure those who offend while on bail are not given an incentive at a later stage, should they be criminally prosecuted, to commit a series of offences on being granted bail a second time.  However, there are constitutional and human rights constraints in these areas and there is a narrow dividing line along which we can operate.  I hope we will be able to address some of these issues in a satisfactory way when the new Bill is published.</p></speech>

While I welcome that it was held, I am afraid I cannot welcome the results of the summit, which have been very disappointing.  In the two weeks since the summit was held, beef prices have barely increased.  O3 steers increased by 0.3% in the first week and last week only increased by one cent per kg.  With regard to R class, there was no change in the first week and there was a very minor change of 0.8% from &euro;3.75 per kg up to &euro;3.78 last week.</p><p>  The biggest problem facing agriculture in the country is that many farmers have significant numbers of young bulls on their hands largely because the beef factories encouraged farmers to accumulate them.  Again, the prices have increased by 0.6% in the first week and 1.7% in the second week.  However, at the moment the price for R-class animals is &euro;3.55 per kg, whereas last year it was &euro;4.11 per kg.  Farmers are facing considerable losses.</p><p>  When addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine recently, Mr. Paddy Gernon of the Irish Cattle Exporters Association outlined that there is a market for those young bulls in Libya and other places but said he could not get boats to take them there because of the licensing regime that pertains in this State.  I tabled a parliamentary question asking how many boats were licensed to take cattle to Libya and the Minister very proudly told me that there were two boats and that Ireland operates the strictest regime in Europe for the live export of animals.  I was told that EU Council regulation No. 1/2005 on animal transport provides for stricter rules to be applied by member states than those set down at EU level.  While that is true, that regulation also requires the adoption of rules in the field of transport of animals in order to eliminate technical barriers to trade in live animals and to allow market organisations to operate smoothly.  The Department seems to have entirely forgotten that objective of the regulation, because the only organisation that can classify boats as being fit is the International Association of Classification Societies.  That is an extremely restrictive practice not operated by any other state.  I find it hard to believe that states such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden do not take animal rights seriously and that we are the only state that does.  I question why we make it so hard to send cattle outside the State and particularly to third countries such as those in north Africa when Bord Bia advises that there is a market there.  The Irish Cattle Exporters Association has advised there is a market there but its members cannot get the boats.</p><p>  Another worrying development is the number of feeding lots being taken up by processors.  Last week the Limerick executive of the IFA passed a motion calling for any farmer who gives his or her feeding lots over to processors to fill to be expelled from the IFA.  The number of feeding lots that processors are taking up, particularly in Munster, enables them to manipulate the market at will.  If prices start to rise - clearly they have not risen in any way since the summit - they can release thousands of cattle into the market to drive the prices down.  At the moment we have a very serious issue with regard to our livestock and increasingly have competition issues.  I want to know what the Department is going to do about it.</p></speech>

The Deputy seeks to address the crisis in beef prices by facilitating live exports.  The trade, whether to other EU member states or to third countries, serves a dual purpose in stimulating price competition for domestic cattle and satisfying a real demand in overseas markets for specific types of animal.  It thus complements the processing beef trade by providing alternative market outlets, thereby underpinning the meat and livestock industry generally.  Currently, two ships have been approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine for live exports to third countries.  The facilitation of this trade by the Department is a key component of our strategy for the beef sector.</p><p>  To date this year, exports of live cattle are up by almost 21,000 head or 23%, principally on the back of large increases in the calf and finished cattle categories.  Shipments to Britain are up by 46% while live exports to Northern Ireland in the period amounted to 13,300 head compared with 11,335 animals for the same period in 2013 - an increase of 17% over the year.  Indications from live exporters are that the higher level of live exports will continue, and live export volumes were further boosted by a recent shipment of 2,500 animals to Libya.</p><p>  There are also acknowledged constraints in the trade of live cattle to Northern Ireland brought about by the marketing strategy operated by the UK retail chains regarding cattle born in the Republic but exported live for finishing and processing in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  The long-standing policy of those retailers that buy Irish beef is to market UK and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country - that is born, reared and slaughtered in the same country - thus decreasing the attractiveness of Irish-born cattle for Northern Ireland meat plants whose customers are large UK retailers.  In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch and packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.</p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised the issue of stocking beef from Irish-born cattle slaughtered in the UK with British retailers over the years, there are no indications that their marketing policy is likely to be reversed soon.  These are commercial decisions, of course.  Nevertheless, Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  This will include a new &euro;500,000 marketing initiative for Bord Bia to intensify its promotion of Irish beef in the UK and selected continental markets.</p><p>  Despite what the Deputy said, the recent beef round-table conference in Dublin Castle on 17 April represented a very useful and constructive engagement opportunity from all sides of the beef industry.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael Dowling, the chairman of the beef activation group, has been asked to review the implementation of that group's recommendations and consider some issues raised at the beef round-table conference.  It has been agreed that it will meet on a quarterly basis.  This reporting system will be dealt with at the next meeting.  There are several issues regarding rural development, the new plans that are coming in and many other issues that were addressed at that round-table conference.  I believe they were quite constructive.  Anyone who participated in it, particularly those representing the industry and the farming organisations, was quite satisfied with it.</p></speech>

Let us consider the figure: 0% increase; 0.3% reduction; 0.3% increase; 1% increase; 1% increase; 0.6% increase; 0.3% increase.  These are across the various classifications of steers and young bulls.</p><p>The figures speak for themselves.  They are not my figures or the IFA's but are the figures of the Department's agency, An Bord Bia.  There has not been an improvement.</p><p> The Minister of State seems to accept that it is okay that only two boats are licensed to ship to North Africa from an island nation.  He made much of the number of exports to Northern Ireland.  I am open to correction but I doubt very much livestock were exported to Northern Ireland in boats.  In the case of Britain, it is roll-on/roll-off.  There are even problems there but, as the Minister of States well knows, one does not require specific licensed boats to take cattle to Britain and that the only place we need them to go to is to third countries, such as Libya, but there are only two boats.</p><p> The issue is that the Minister of State's Department is proud of the fact it operates the most restrictive regime in Europe.  I would like to know why.  Is it really about animal safety or is it about subverting competition and protecting particular processors?  Will the Department do something about the fact feed lots across this State are being filled by processors which gives them the power to subvert competition and to hammer beef prices?  As soon as prices rise, they open those feed lots and release thousands of cattle to drive down the prices.  Will this anti-competitive practise be investigated because if it is not, many farmers who had cattle in sheds all winter and who have cattle in sheds now will be in trouble?  They are losing money on every head of cattle because, as I said, prices are way down on this time last year.  The Minister of State knows that, as do I.  The prices for store cattle at the marts are not down.  People are looking at losses unless something is done.  If nothing is done, the Minister of State can rename Agriculture House, Goodman House. </p></speech>

One does not send animals in boats in very poor condition.  That is important because animals can die.  As the Deputy knows, they have to travel a long way by sea and they have to be maintained.  I do not think the Department or anybody in this country would stand over a regime unless it was strict, which it has to be.</p><p>  The fact of the matter is that the figures have risen.  The Department is committed to allowing a free market.  It is important competition is the life of the trade, whether for the processors or the live industry.

What needs to happen is for us to produce an animal which the market demands.  As the Deputy knows, there is a changing trend, in particular in England, in regard to the type of animal needed.

The round table discussions, the reporting back by Mr. Michael Dowling and what he will put in place in the coming months will help the beef industry.  I accept people must be sure because a lot of money is being invested.  The Deputy made the point that the processors are buying the feed lots all over the country.  The reason for that is that some farmers cannot finance it.  It is very expensive to buy a lot of animals to fill a feed lot.  It is an issue which needs to be addressed over a period of time and I certainly hope the round table discussions will deal with that.</p></speech>

Farmers are suffering due to the beef prices.  Hopefully, the Department will put in place a scheme that can assist them in ascertaining what the market demands.</p><p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting my topic and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for coming to the House despite a very busy schedule.  I wish him well in the election.  I sincerely hope he is elected and that Europe's gain is this House's loss.</p><p>  The flood relief scheme in Arklow is the topic under debate.  It is more than ten years since I sat with Oireachtas Members and members of Arklow Town Council following the floods in the early part of the last decade.  The then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Mr. Martin Cullen, committed that if a scheme could be devised which could prevent flooding in the future, the funding would be provided for it.  We struggled on for a long number of years under the illusion that something was being done.  Several reports were done on the issue but nothing happened.</p><p>  Following the change in Government in 2011 and inquiring from the Minister's office as to what the situation was, I was dismayed to find that the file was lying in a cupboard and very little had been done.  I acknowledge the work the Minister has done over the past couple of years in providing funding to consultants to devise a scheme for Arklow which would prevent flooding, in particular in the lower part of the town, the Ferrybank area and the Sea Road where the Avoca River meets the Irish Sea.  Much preparatory work has been carried out and my understanding is that all reports are complete.  </p><p>  In 2012, &euro;42,000 was granted by the Department to build a flood protection wall along the edge of the Avoca River in the town and a small amount of money - &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 - was given to clear out the river.  Is the funding available for the scheme?  When will it be provided?  When can the council start to put the process in place?  This is very important.  The people of Arklow have waited several political generations, or 30 years to 40 years, for this funding.  Will the Minister of State outline when that funding will be provided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000019#R01000"><p>I thank Deputy Timmins for giving me the opportunity to address this matter.  I know he has taken a particular interest in the issue over many years.</p><p>  A flood relief scheme for the town of Arklow is being advanced by Arklow Town Council in partnership with the Office of Public Works and my Department, which is providing the funding.  The project is being overseen by a steering group which comprises representatives of Arklow Town Council, the council's consultants and the OPW.  The scheme is moving through all the required stages of design and development and has progressed to a stage where a feasibility report is nearing finalisation following detailed consultations between Arklow Town Council, the council's engineering consultants and the OPW.</p><p>  As the Deputy might be aware, I met with a delegation from Arklow Town Council in regard to the proposed scheme in November 2013 and I indicated at that meeting that there is an absolute commitment on all sides to progress and complete a flood relief scheme for Arklow to ensure that the people and businesses of the town are protected from the terrible flooding that devastated the town in previous years.  I want to restate that commitment to the House and to Deputy Timmins again today and to confirm that, on the basis that a viable, cost beneficial scheme is proposed to the OPW, then funding for this will be made available as required.  The Arklow scheme is provided for in the OPW's multi-annual capital expenditure profiles.</p><p>  As the Deputy said, the Arklow scheme has been a long time in preparation and I can understand the local frustration over the length of time it has taken to get to a point of construction.  It is, however, in the nature of flood defence schemes which involve complex civil engineering works within a river environment in an urban setting that the amount of planning and preparation required is necessarily very detailed and takes a long time to complete.  I might mention in this context, however, that the OPW provided funding to Wicklow County Council in 2012 under the minor flood mitigation works scheme to carry out interim flood relief works in Arklow.  These works, comprising the construction of a new flood protection wall, have been completed and offer protection to properties and businesses in the Riverwalk-town centre area of the town.</p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, a feasibility study to identify possible flood mitigation measures for Arklow town in nearing completion.  This Study was commissioned by Arklow Town Council but funded by the OPW.  In addition, environmental consultants were appointed by the OPW to carry out an environmental impact statement and to work in tandem with the engineering consultants in identifying environmentally acceptable measures.</p><p>It was also necessary to commission separate surveys of the quay walls and an assessment report on Arklow Bridge when it became evident that a number of potential flood alleviation measures might impact on the bridge.  All of these assessments have now been brought together in a draft final feasibility report on the scheme by Arklow Town Council's consultants.  The purpose of the report is to identify and assess using technical, environmental and economic criteria the viability of a range of flood relief measures for Arklow.  Based on this assessment, the report is to identify and recommend a preferred flood relief scheme and to prepare an outline design of the recommended scheme.</p><p> The OPW has been engaged over the past year or two in extensive consultation and discussions with our colleagues in Arklow Town Council and the consultants.  The latest draft of the feasibility report was submitted by Arklow Town Council to the OPW in late 2013.  The report has been examined in detail within the OPW and the OPW has very recently written to Arklow Town Council seeking clarification on a number of mainly technical issues.  I am confident that any remaining issues can be resolved without undue delay and that Arklow Town Council will be in a position to finalise the feasibility report for the scheme shortly.  When the report is finalised, and provided the preferred scheme is economically and environmentally viable, the OPW and Arklow Town Council, in conjunction with Wicklow County Council, will decide on the most effective means of progressing the project through the next stages of detailed design, planning and statutory consents and procurement of a works contractor.  Pending that, it is not possible to give a definite date or timescale.  However, I assure the Deputy that the OPW will work constructively with the local authority to ensure the scheme is progressed as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is ironic that we are talking about flood relief in Arklow when there has been a dramatic shortage of water in the greater north Wicklow area &ndash; Greystones, Enniskerry and Kilmacanogue - in recent days.  The area is supplied by the Vartry river, which also supplies a large part of Dublin city.  Ironically, Dublin city has not suffered but Wicklow has.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to pass on to his colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government my concerns on water shortages in north Wicklow and the ongoing problems with the reservoir, and to liaise with Irish Water to ensure the shortages are resolved.</p><p>  I would have liked to hear a definitive start date.  I note that the Minister for Finance is present in the Chamber.  I am sure he will have no difficulty providing the funding to the Minister of State shortly as, hopefully, a going-away present, so that he can make an announcement in the coming weeks.  I note the provision for the scheme in the capital profile of the Department.  A feasibility study has been completed; it has gone back to the OPW and it is currently with Arklow Town Council.  The Minister of State indicated in his response that he could not provide a timeframe, but could he take a stab at doing so?  Could he also indicate whether the outstanding technical issues are major or minor?</p></speech>

We are at a very advanced stage with the feasibility report.  We have gone back to Arklow Town Council for a number of observations and I expect the issue to be resolved by the summer.  Once the report is back with us we will know the preferred design and the cost-benefit ratio, which will clearly be strong, given that 600 properties are involved, of which 450 are houses and the rest are commercial premises.  Once we have the report back I am very confident that the OPW will be able to profile the work as part of its multi-annual plan.  One of the benefits of having a multi-annual envelope of funds available for this and other schemes is that we can get going on it in a relatively short time, because I understand the work will take years, with a lot of disruption to the town and the community.  We must undergo a planning process and a design process and we need the public to buy into it, because it will cause disruption to the commercial life of the town, as is the case in many parts of the country I visited recently, such as Fermoy and Mitchelstown.  It takes time to develop a scheme in all of those areas.  I reassure the Deputy that we are very aware of the importance of the scheme for Arklow and County Wicklow.  It is a priority for us and we have funds in place as part of the existing multi-annual financial framework.  As soon as we get the feasibility issues over the line, especially on the cost-benefit side, we can then get going on the design, planning and consultation stages with the community.</p><p>  I reassure Deputy Timmins that the funds are very much in place for the scheme.  It is a major priority for us.  We have a huge responsibility to the local area, which has been dramatically affected in the past two decades on more than six different occasions.  The life of the town has been badly affected by flood and storm damage.  The complication in this case is due to there being a problem with the sea and with the river.  A fluvial event with the sea coming in could mean a disaster for the town.  Providing a solution is hydrologically complex and we must get it right before we commit the funds, but I assure the Deputy that the funding is in place.</p></speech>

It availed of EU rules that allowed it to be regulated in another EU jurisdiction while operating solely in this jurisdiction.  I urge the Minister to address two concerns.  The first is the most pressing one that affects the 75,000 policyholders.  Many of them have contacted me.  It is clear that a large section of the client base for the insurance company was self-employed people, in particular small businesses with vans, such as those in the construction industry or other businesses requiring vans.  They seek clarity on the legal position, whether they are legally covered, what the situation is with the money they paid out a couple of weeks ago to renew their cover, why the State does not protect them, and whether they have any comeback.</p><p>  I was contacted by one person from County Monaghan who was informed by an insurance broker that he or she needed to continue to pay the premium for the rest of the year despite the fact that the person is now not insured, the reason being that the broker paid Setanta Insurance in full up front.  Questions arise in that regard also.  How do we ensure this does not happen in future at an EU level?</p><p>  I urge the Minister to address a couple of issues.  What role will be played by the insurance compensation fund?  Does the Government plan to take any offsetting measures, particularly given that many small and medium enterprises are being hard hit?</p></speech>

Those affected are predominantly self-employed people.  There is a question mark over the status of their insurance cover.  Questions also arise about those who still owe money and what the position is in that regard.</p><p>  I understand the liquidators are due to have a meeting this week.  Will the Government be represented at the meeting?  I have been contacted by a number of constituents about those who have outstanding claims with Setanta Insurance &ndash; people whose lives have been torn asunder because of road traffic accidents and injury at work who have been unable to work and who have sustained lifelong injuries and are currently awaiting payment.  Will the claims Setanta cannot pay be met by the compensation fund, given that the insurer is not regulated in this country?</p><p>I understand that the Irish Brokers Association has called for a complete overhaul of the insurance regulation following the liquidation of Setanta.  Mr. John Bissett, the association's president, said the system needs to be completely overhauled so that companies cannot simply pick the most lax jurisdictions.  It is our job as legislators, and as a Government, to protect consumers.  What we had was a company primarily owned by Irish people and principally based in Ireland selling exclusively to Irish citizens but regulated elsewhere.</p><p> I refer to the poignant case of a young woman who, along with her family, was hit by a drunk driver who was insured by Setanta.  There were two fatalities in the accident and even though no money will replace those lives, she will be unable to work again because of the injuries she sustained and both her and her young son are without her partner.  What will be done for these people?</p></speech>

The other Deputies have covered the main issues but I would like to lend my support to the 75,000 policyholders of Setanta Insurance Company Limited who have been at least inconvenienced and, in a great many cases, are out of pocket as a result of the collapse of the firm.  What assistance is available from the State to them in the context of the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF to deal with outstanding claims which were not concluded by the firm prior to going into liquidation?  What is the position of people who recently renewed their policies and who face the prospect of having to take out a new policy to ensure they have continuity of cover?  People who have a Setanta policy are legally covered under the Road Traffic Acts in the sense that they have insurance but the policy may not be of any value if an accident happens.</p><p>  This raises a broader question as to how many similar companies operate in Ireland but are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Many people have not drawn this distinction.  If they take out insurance in this country, they assume that the insurance provider is regulated by the Central Bank and is not merely regulated in another EU jurisdiction and regulated here for conduct of business purposes.  We need at least to scope the extent of this problem.</p><p>  What will be the impact of banking union and the single supervisory mechanism on the future regulation of the insurance sector on a pan-European basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000021#T00300"><p>I thank the three Members for raising this important issue and for their contributions to this exchange of views.</p><p>  Setanta Insurance Company Limited is a Maltese incorporated company, which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA.  While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland, as it has no role in that regard, the firm is supervised by the bank for conduct of business rules, that is, consumer protection obligations.  I understand that the Central Bank has been in ongoing contact with the MFSA in respect of Setanta in recent times.</p><p>  Under EU law governing non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home member state - its home regulator - that it intends to pursue business in another member state.  The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU solvency capital requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake.  The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>  Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law was, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November 2013, a new regime known as solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework.  The solvency II EU directive sets out new, stronger Union-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater co-operation between supervisors.</p><p>  On 16 April 2014, Setanta Insurance Company Limited determined that it was insolvent.  This means that Setanta did not have sufficient funds to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.  Policyholders can expect to be given two months' cancellation notification, in accordance with the Central Bank of Ireland's Consumer Protection Code 2012, during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served, it is important to be clear that the amounts due under claims may not be fully recoverable in all circumstances.  In this light, it is important to note that the Central Bank has advised all Setanta policyholders to arrange alternative cover without delay.</p><p>  At a creditors meeting held in Malta today, a liquidator, Mr. Paul Mercieca, was formally appointed by the creditors and was approved by the Maltese regulator.  The company has now, therefore, been formally placed into liquidation.  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, has indicated that it intends to accept all third party claims connected to Setanta policies.  MIBI is a non-profit-making organisation, which was established by agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland.  The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  First party claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  Claimants will be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser</p><p>  I am informed that Insurance Ireland made arrangements for its member insurance companies to be open over the Easter period to assist Setanta policyholders in arranging alternative cover.  In addition, the Insurance Ireland declined cases agreement was available to policyholders of Setanta.  The current declined cases agreement was drawn up in 1981 and is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland.  I am further informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if he or she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  I understand that Insurance Ireland is also making information available to those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in respect of this matter.</p><p>  The Central Bank is in ongoing contact with the MFSA regarding Setanta, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information, particularly in regard to claims.  The Central Bank has written to all brokers and has instructed them to write to all policyholders who hold a current Setanta motor insurance policy and inform them of the urgency of making alternative motor insurance arrangements.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank will review the circumstances relating to Setanta and will report to me on what lessons can be learned and how the regulatory framework can be strengthened.  The European Commission has also indicated that it will review whatever issues are raised relating to the regulatory framework which require action.</p></speech>

However, I am not concerned that "claimants will only be eligible for 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser".  The case I cited will involve a much greater sum.  What will be done to ensure such lax regulation, albeit under EU law, cannot continue?  This was a primarily Irish company selling to Irish consumers but it was regulated elsewhere.  This is the kind of practice we would like to banish to the past in order that consumers can be protected.  I refer not only to those who have suffered loss or injury in a car accident, but also those who are self-employed and trying to keep a business going given a significant number of Setanta's customers were self-employed.</p><p>What comfort can the Minister offer to these people who are so badly and desperately in need of good news?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000022#U00200"><p>I thank the Minister very much for his reply which clarifies that the premiums paid by policyholders to Setanta Insurance are gone and none of the funds open in respect of claims can deal with the issue of refunding premium payments which have been made.  The lesson for insurance consumers is to check immediately whether the company providing their insurance is regulated in Ireland.  It will come as news to a great many people they have an insurance policy in Ireland which is provided by a firm which is not regulated here and the Central Bank of Ireland has no role whatsoever in prudential supervision.  This is a risk and exposure.  While the new system of pan-European supervision and regulation gets up and running and becomes stronger consumers must deal with this risk.  If anything, greater awareness of the potential exposure faced by people having a policy provided by a company not regulated in Ireland is something we should all learn.</p></speech>

It is not clear yet from Malta, because the company only went into liquidation today, whether there are assets which partially support the outstanding claims of the company.  I am sure it will be clarified in due course.</p><p>  The insurance compensation scheme we operate here between the State and insurance companies is committed to covering 65% or something over &euro;800,000, which ever is the lesser amount.  While people are insured to drive for two months after the first announcement was made I strongly advise them to seek new insurance immediately because while they will be driving in accordance with the Road Traffic Act they will not necessarily be covered, or covered adequately, for any claims they may have to make themselves or claims which might be made by third parties.</p><p>  I take Deputy McGrath's point and I see this as the start of a wider debate.  The provision of insurance across State boundaries in the European Union is part of the single market in financial services.  It is something we all support.  We must be sure regulation is adequate and I have no evidence yet there was any inadequacy in the Maltese regulation.  It is a member of the eurozone as well as being a member of the European Union.  We will see, and I will communicate to the D&aacute;il in due course as further information comes to hand.</p></speech>

Evidence of the murder of the baby was lost and contaminated and the investigation into this most heinous of crimes was closed down after six weeks.  No one was ever brought to trial for it.  Cynthia alleges the abuse continued as did the abuse of her siblings, three of whom later took their own lives.</p><p>  The Minister is aware of all of this because he acted as solicitor for a period for Cynthia Owen.  A coroner's inquest confirmed the baby murdered was Cynthia Owen's baby meaning, and this is beyond doubt, a crime was committed.  She was raped as a child and her baby was murdered.  Incredibly, no one has ever been brought to justice for this.</p><p>  In recent weeks I asked the Minister, on foot of representations from Cynthia and her legal representative, Gerry Dunne, whether the Minister would meet with them to discuss reopening the investigation into this case.  He stated he would not do so because it might raise unrealistic expectations and he referred to the Gageby report on this matter, which was published in 2007.  This response is completely unacceptable because the Gageby report was a paper review.  Mr. Gageby refused to talk to Cynthia Owen even though she offered to give evidence.  Her solicitor reports that only a few weeks before being appointed to this position Mr. Gageby stated publicly, at a national prosecutors' conference, that he believed cases of rape and abuse more than 15 years old should not be investigated.  He stated counsellors and psychologists working in this area usually gave unreliable evidence.  This was a very biased position to take on an examination of such a serious issue.  The examination was a travesty.</p><p>  The Minister is well aware of the facts because he represented Ms Owen for a while.  Cynthia Owen is asking for an independent public sworn inquiry to reopen the case and examine how the investigation was conducted and get justice.  This is a very reasonable request.  She has written to the Minister and the Taoiseach-----</p></speech>

This is a matter with which I have an intimate knowledge because for a period of time I represented <i>de bono</i>Cynthia Owen in my law firm and tried to be of assistance to her.  I am aware of background information and I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of everything of which I am aware.  This is a case which greatly troubled me during the period of time I sought to be of assistance to her.  I emphasise I sought to be of assistance to her <i>de bono</i>and there was no question of being paid anything in case the Deputy wants to make some allegation about this.  This was an issue I took, and still take, with great seriousness.</p><p>I fully understand the detailed concerns that have been raised about the infant who died in such terrible circumstances and I am, of course, deeply conscious of the ongoing profound trauma and distress of the mother of the child concerned.  The House will be aware that concerns raised by myself and many others regarding this case led to the appointment in 2007 of an independent senior counsel, Mr. Patrick Gageby, by the then Minister, to conduct a thorough examination of the matters relating to this tragic death.  It is regrettable the Deputy would use this House to defame Mr. Gageby and he should withdraw the comments he made.</p><p>The Deputy should withdraw the comments he made.  Mr. Gageby is a well-respected senior counsel who was appointed by my predecessor to examine this matter.  It was a time when I was raising this issue from the Opposition benches as well as publicly.</p><p> Mr. Gageby's terms of reference provided for a comprehensive review of all of the relevant information concerning the death of the child in question, as well as the complaints made regarding the Garda investigations into the incident.  Mr. Gageby reported in September 2007 and, having considered the report's recommendations, the then Minister accepted its findings.  In keeping with those findings, he decided against establishing a further inquiry.  I am aware that a summary of Mr. Gageby's views was furnished to the individual's then solicitors and, ultimately, they were given access to the full report.  The request was made by my predecessor that the report be published and I understand the person concerned and her lawyer were not agreeable to the publication of Mr. Gageby's report.  I am not privy to the reason this was so, but simply am telling this to the Deputy because I would prefer there to be transparency to the extent of its being published.</p><p> Insofar as the question of a criminal investigation into the case is concerned, it is important to note that in addition to the original Garda investigation, a number of further Garda investigations have been carried out over the years in response to statements made to the Garda by the mother of the infant.  On foot of these investigations, files were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who on each occasion directed that no prosecution take place.  A further investigation file also was submitted to the DPP in the context of matters which came to light following the coroner's inquest in 2007 and again, no direction to prosecute was received.  Insofar as the question of any further criminal investigations into these distressing events is concerned, Members will appreciate that I have no function with regard to the initiation, management or direction of criminal investigations, which are a matter for the Garda authorities, nor in respect of the prosecution of offences, which is a matter for the DPP.  It of course remains at all times a matter for the Garda authorities to consider the question of any further criminal investigation.</p><p> I can also inform the House that I received a petition with a significant number of signatures on behalf of the mother of the child concerned on 4 April calling for an independent inquiry.  Further correspondence also was received from her legal representatives raising complex issues of concern.  On foot of this, I sought a full report from the Garda authorities on the issues raised and on the contact which I understand is taking place between local Garda management and the person's legal representatives, which contact preceded the petition received on 4 April.  In this regard, I am advised that senior local Garda management has met with the legal representative of the person in question to assess the issues of concern which have been raised and with a view to attempting to resolve these concerns.  I am advised that the most recent meeting took place on 31 March 2014.  I understand that some further inquiries have been conducted and the matter is presently ongoing.  As soon as I receive and consider the report I have sought, I will be in a position to communicate further with the person in question, including with respect to her call for a further inquiry into these matters.</p><p> I assure the Deputy that I take this matter with the greatest of seriousness and indeed took it so seriously that at an early stage following my appointment, I made inquiries within my Department with regard to it.  The Deputy does not need to convince me of the tragic background.  I emphasise to the Deputy that a range of allegations has been made, and I will not prejudge the truth of those allegations, but the background circumstances as described by the individual in question are troubling and tragic.  However, in the context of where matters stand so far, it certainly has been the view of the DPP that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the taking of a prosecution in the matter.  Should something now emerge as a result of the further inquiries that are being conducted, I will treat it with great care and seriousness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000023#V00200"><p>I accept that some matters are simply at the level of allegations, but some aspects are not allegations but facts.  The coroner's court established that the baby, Noleen, who was murdered, stabbed 44 times and left in a lane, was Cynthia Owen's.  As Cynthia Owen was 11 years old, therefore it follows directly that she was raped.  There is no question but that an absolutely heinous crime was committed against a child.  Nobody has been prosecuted for that, even though the victim of this crime has stated who she says committed that crime.  The fact she states it does not make it fact, but it certainly seems to me is the basis for requiring a proper investigation of that case.  It is absolutely extraordinary that the victim was not interviewed in a review of this case carried out in 2007, despite the fact that the victim and her representative contacted the senior counsel, Mr. Gageby, and said, please interview us.  How can that be constituted as a serious inquiry into this most heinous of crimes?  I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone, but I cannot fathom how in a situation such as this the victim would not have her request to be interviewed about the crimes committed against her acceded to by someone looking at the case.  She therefore begs for justice and for the allegations she has made and the crimes committed against her to be investigated properly.</p><p>  I am glad to see that in the last few weeks there seems to have been movement on this, and if the Minister said there is confusion about publishing reports and so on, that is a reason for him to meet them to clarify these matters if it would help to move this forward.  However, I do not understand why the Minister refuses to meet them.  Having spoken to Ms Cynthia Owen's solicitor this morning, they wish to know what is the timescale for the Garda to report back to the Minister about its investigations bearing in mind that the only garda&iacute; investigating this are garda&iacute; serving in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area where the crime was committed, albeit a new generation of garda&iacute;.  This is not to cast aspersions on them by any means, but this matter is so serious, and given that there is an allegation that garda&iacute; were involved in the abuse and the alleged cover-up, there must be a commitment to something more serious in respect of an investigation of these matters.  A sworn public inquiry is what Ms Cynthia Owen has asked for and what I believe any fair person looking at it would say she deserves.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett, with whom I frequently disagree, that this is an issue on which there is no disagreement between us.  If this issue can be advanced in a manner that would bring some closure to it and that would ensure that identifiable individuals who can be properly prosecuted will be prosecuted, that would be a desirable outcome.  The holding of a statutory inquiry will not achieve that outcome.  It may achieve the outcome of an investigation of the investigation but it will not automatically lead to any prosecution by the DPP.  This is an issue I raised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na well before the petition was received by me.  I wish to see what comes back to me.  While I cannot give the Deputy a timeframe, I hope that within the next couple of months I will have an insight as to whether there is finally something additional the Garda can produce that is of relevance to the possibility of a prosecution.</p><p>I am advised that in the past there has been extensive engagement with the woman concerned and with her current lawyer and I am told there has been recent engagement.  I am told the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understands all the allegations made and the history of this matter as it has been recounted to it.  It is a case of what evidence exists and whether there is a basis for taking a prosecution.  I would hope within the next two months to have a greater insight into that than I have now.  With regard to Mr. Gageby's report, he is a very eminent senior counsel who frequently acts in the courts defending individuals on a broad range of charges.  I do not know if he prosecutes on occasions as I am not that familiar with his legal practice but I know he regularly appears in the courts.  He is an expert in criminal matters.  I understand that in his review of the matter he concluded that there was not a basis for the holding of the type of inquiry being suggested.  There was no further that this could go, based on the information currently available.</p><p> Let me see what additional information comes available.  I ask Deputy Boyd Barrett to assume that for once we are on the same side on this issue, and that if I can take this forward in a way that is of benefit and of assistance to the woman concerned in bringing closure to her life on what is an alleged dreadful set of circumstances, I would be very pleased to be able to do so.</p></speech>

The details of that scheme and regime were released by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the following day, a day after the Taoiseach was questioned in the House on the same issue but about which he could give very little information.  However, the following day the print and broadcast media were full of significant details about the water tax regime, with the Minister, Deputy Hogan confirming that there would be a standing charge of &euro;50 which people would pay irrespective of ability to pay.  There was no ability to pay clause included in the regime nor any provision for low income earners.  Those whose houses would not have been metered by the time of the introduction of the charge would be given estimated bills.  In the aftermath of the revelations in the media, the Labour Party articulated some degree of shock, mainly at the angry reaction to the Minister's revelations to the media, and it called a halt.  Since then there has been a lot of spinning and counter-spinning between Fine Gael and the Labour Party as to who is to blame for the debacle and the fiasco.</p><p>  Before the Easter recess the T&aacute;naiste told the House that a number of issues remain to be addressed.  He said that he wished those issues had been addressed some months ago but they remain to be addressed.  It is clear he was being critical of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  The T&aacute;naiste said that three out of every four households would not be metered by the time the charge is introduced.  The T&aacute;naiste said he wanted a rebate system for those who have not been metered if their usage was lower than estimated.  He wanted an ability to pay clause implemented, the Labour Party being a relative newcomer and recently converted to the idea of ability to pay.  He was particularly concerned about old people, pensioners and people on low incomes.  The Labour Party has said now that it is opposed to the idea of a standing charge because it goes against the principle of conservation.</p><p>  The Cabinet met today.  Has the Government dealt conclusively with the issues outlined by the T&aacute;naiste?  Has a final decision been made about the water tax regime to be introduced under the aegis of Irish Water?  Will the Taoiseach confirm if there will be a standing charge?  What kind of ability to pay mechanism will be introduced?  Will a rebate system be available for those who have not been metered or will not be metered prior to the introduction of the charge?  Will there be a waiver system for pensioners or a means test?  In the words of the T&aacute;naiste, will these decisions be made quickly and will certainty and answers be provided to the people?</p></speech>

Genuinely, a number of issues related to the vulnerable sectors of society need to be teased out and made right. Many Deputies raised the issue of the progress of the water metering programme and how to make the charges fair, affordable and as equitable as possible.  The point that needs to be reiterated, irrespective of whichever party or none, is that the current system is completely unfit for purpose.  We cannot have a situation where 20,000 people are expected to live their lives with boil water notices every day, where 40% of the water in Dublin city leaks into the ground, and where &euro;1.2 billion is paid out every year for an inferior system.  We all want the country to be attractive for consumers, business and foreign investment.  Major industries require a high volume of pristine water and we are not in a position to deal with that requirement in the way we would like without having the facility of Irish Water to borrow and invest to fix all the leaks and provide a structure for the next 50 years.</p><p>  I confirm to Deputy Martin that the discussions about those issues are genuinely very constructive and we hope to have this matter concluded quickly in order that the people will have clarity and will know what exactly is involved.  We have refocused on those sectors which have been referred to by many people, so that the charges for them can be as fair and equitable and as affordable as possible in the interests of providing a system that will deal with the gross inadequacies and also provide a platform which the entire country can be assured will provide high quality water and an infrastructure that is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

It would have been nice if there had been a constructive debate in this House.  Before Christmas the Taoiseach railroaded the legislation for Irish Water through the House.

People are climbing aboard Irish Water every week, in addition to the existing county council delivery system.  There was no debate about the &euro;180 million spent on consultancies.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios ag an Taoiseach, agus &eacute; ag rith ar fud na h&aacute;ite, go bhfuil na daoine buartha faoi seo.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach informed the House that the water tax would cost householders an average of &euro;240 per annum.  While the Labour Party was clearly on board at that time, the T&aacute;naiste, panicked by the sheer weight of public anger on this issue, initiated a belated negotiation on the detail of the tax.  In the same period, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, provided details which the Taoiseach would not provide in the House and, in his usual off-hand manner, reassured everybody that the issue would be speedily resolved.  The T&aacute;naiste responded by stating the Labour Party would not be bound by any timetable.  There one has it.  It is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee and Government parties that are at odds with each other over an issue that was Fianna F&aacute;il Party policy.  At that time, it was opposed by the Labour Party and became one of the subjects of the party's Tesco advertisement during the general election campaign.  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, knows, this is the type of thing one does during an election campaign.  We must now conclude that the current shenanigans in the Cabinet are not about people's rights, conserving water, the provision of clean water or saving taxpayers' money but about trying to cobble together yet another pre-election stunt.  One thing that is clear from everything we have heard is that there will be a water tax because the Labour Party does not have the spine or gumption to say &quot;No&quot; to Fine Gael.  In the spirit of transparency, accountability and the openness he often professes, will the Taoiseach tell citizens and the Oireachtas how much the water tax will cost householders?</p></speech>

Other than that, there has been no real encouragement from the Government for those who take such courageous actions.  For anyone to step forward again, it would take an even greater act of bravery than before.</p><p>  In the past week, I was approached under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act by a serving member of the Garda with a serious allegation of corruption within the national drugs squad.  This morning, I brought the evidence I was presented with to GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, in the company of former garda, John Wilson.  However, the problem we have is that the garda who gave me the evidence is terrified that members of the Garda who are serving with GSOC could somehow leak this information and, as a result, evidence would be tampered with.  The garda in question may have no need to be afraid but that is beside the point.  The bigger issue is that so long as serving members of the Garda are working within GSOC, how can such distinguished people trust it.</p><p>  I understand the Government is reviewing the operation of GSOC but it is all taking too long.  In the meantime, however, those who wish to seek justice are left with nowhere to go, except for our offices.  The Taoiseach did have the opportunity last year in the House to act but, instead, he rubbished Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s policing Bill, dismissing it by stating there was no problem at all.</p><p>  It was a worrying ordeal for the garda in question to go to GSOC today, given his understandable concern about confidentiality.  However, this worry was significantly increased this morning when it became obvious that we were under surveillance by an unmarked Garda car while waiting in the now infamous Insomnia cafe adjacent to GSOC&rsquo;s premises.  John Wilson, who was there with me for support, left the cafe momentarily to establish what was going on.</p></speech>

An Oireachtas committee is looking at the terms of reference in respect of GSOC.  These are matters of the greatest importance.

Hopefully, we will have a proper and thorough response for him.</p><p>  It seems that anybody who has had any connection with a garda over the past 30 years wants to bring forward reports and comments.  We want to devise a system to be able to deal with these fairly and thoroughly in the interests of following through on allegations and, if they are true, dealing with them and, if not, addressing that aspect.</p><p>  I cannot comment on the Deputy&rsquo;s report to the House of being under surveillance and being followed or whatever.  If he wants to give me whatever documentation he has, I will treat it with the utmost confidence, unless he says otherwise, and attempt to have a follow-through made for him.</p><p>  With regard to the policing legislation introduced by Deputy Wallace last year, whenever the Guerin report is issued and whatever recommendations it makes will be followed through, as I have already said in the House.  There are a whole range of issues with regard to justice and the different systems that are now being analysed and investigated.  The House will have full sight of those for discussion and implementation of whatever recommendations come forward, including the Deputy.</p></speech>

Today, I was hoping the Taoiseach might give a little bit of encouragement.  The bigger issue is not the individual case but the fact that no one can have confidence in GSOC so long as serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are operating within it.  That was the issue I wanted to raise today.  However, the Taoiseach belittles and makes a joke out of being followed by an unmarked car with two obviously identifiable police officers.  When he is going to do something about this?</p><p>  The Taoiseach needs to deal with this quickly because people are losing faith in what they have to have faith in, namely the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Whether it is my wife or my children, if something happens we have to go to the Garda and trust it.  At the moment, that trust is not on the floor but below it.  The Taoiseach needs to deal with this seriously.  The one thing I was certain about today was that he would not answer my question because he has never answered a question since I came in here.  Can he try and make it a first?  Will he tell me and the people that he is going to do something about this issue?  After that incident today, the man in question was not terrified anymore, he was quivering.  He was on the verge of breaking down.  I bring it up here but you make a joke out of it.  You are a disgrace.</p></speech>

I note the comments of the interim Garda Commissioner about where there is room for dissenting voices in the force and the need to protect whistleblowers when they come forward.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has made a decision to have a statutory independent authority for the Garda.  I myself chair the new committee in respect of justice reform and the committee dealing with the statutory independent authority.  The latter committee had its first meeting this week.  The process is now being set in train for public consultation with hearings by the appropriate committee.

I have put it to him previously that there is a genuine crisis in general practice across the country.  GPs are meeting in huge numbers across the country.  We are all receiving communications from them.  Just two days ago, I received a communication from a GP who is emigrating because he or she finds it impossible to work productively, healthily or sustainably as a GP in this country's health service.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide Government time for a comprehensive debate on the state of general practice.</p><p>  Mass meetings are being held all over the country.  Morale has never been lower.  Young GPs in education are leaving and are not following through into this country.  They are emigrating because they see no future for them in general practice.  If the Taoiseach asks any of his own Deputies, or a Deputy from any other party in the House, they will confirm that there is a crisis among our GPs.  It is not good for our health service.  Regardless of whatever else one might say about our primary care system, at least it provides for people to get seen on the day they ask to be seen by a GP.  There is a great deal of disquiet out there.  It relates, for example, to the horrific contract that was put together by the Government to gag GPs and make life unbearable for them.  I would like Government time to be allocated - perhaps next week - for a debate in this House on general practice and the future of GPs in this country.</p><p>  I note that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has ruled out any inquiry into the murders that took place in Ballymurphy in 1971, or the establishment of an independent panel to look into the matter.  I met the Ballymurphy families many times when I served as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I was always of the view that an independent panel would at least create some basis to get an official position on the record in relation to these horrific deaths.  I am aware that the Taoiseach has been of a similar view.  I suggest that this House should be given an opportunity to take an all-party approach to the issue, as it has done on other issues, with a view to making it clear that the Oireachtas believes such an independent panel should be established.</p></speech>

I felt that the request from the Ballymurphy residents was very clear and reasonable.  For that reason, I supported it on behalf of the Government.  I will be happy to allow a debate on this when it is appropriate.  Obviously, the 40th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is coming up.</p></speech>

We will certainly have that discussed at the meeting of the Whips and approved where appropriate.</p><p>  I receive a great deal of correspondence about issues relating to general practitioners.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, spent two hours dealing with the doctors' questions to him.  It was a very good engagement.  This consultation is continuing to take place.  Significant progress has been and can be made here.  The doctors have brought a number of issues to my personal attention.  I have discussed some of them with the Minister of State.  I will bring to his attention other matters that have been referred to.  Obviously, the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip can raise this matter at the meeting of the Whips.  If it is appropriate, there might be an opportunity to have a discussion on it.  I genuinely want to say that the consultations which are taking place have made significant progress.  Obviously, the doctors will want to make their case trenchantly and strongly.  There has been quite a deal of good consultation here.  I think the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, has dealt with a number of the issues of concern to doctors and to the medical profession in general.  We will follow that through at the meeting of the Whips.</p></speech>

The man in question, Garda John Wilson, has done a great service to this State and is not involved in a "pantomime".  I think these issues should be taken seriously.</p><p>  On the Order of Business, the Government has today re-announced the establishment of the banking inquiry and informed us that a motion providing for it will be brought before the House next week.  I must say I am disappointed that there was no consultation with the Opposition on this announcement.  We heard about it through social media and the rest.  I welcome the establishment of the banking inquiry.  Sinn F&eacute;in has strongly pushed for an inquiry to take place.  Does the Government have a timeframe for the banking inquiry?  When will it start?  When will it finish?</p><p>  Following the conclusion of the Anglo Irish Bank trial, which will allow the banking inquiry to go ahead even if there is another trial to take place, has the Government considered overhauling the white collar crime legislation?  During the lifetime of this Government, hundreds of our citizens have gone to prison for not paying fines but not one banker has gone to prison yet.  Will a commission be asked to investigate or overhaul white collar crime?  Will some type of action be taken here?  No one was held accountable following the Moriarty tribunal.  No one has been held accountable in a real or meaningful way following the banking trials.  The inquiry that is being established will be unable to hold certain people to account in the way the public wants them to be held to account.  Does the Government intend to take some action in this regard, or merely to allow this to die away?</p></speech>

I respect absolutely the right of people to come forward with information about wrong-doing.  That is why the legislation is being treated with the respect it deserves.  I hope the Deputy understands that.</p><p>  Regarding the banking inquiry, the Deputy is aware that the inquiries legislation, which will give us an opportunity to do this, has gone through.  It was not a matter for the Government to put this in place, but the Government triggered the issue of having an inquiry and allowing for that to happen with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the relevant committees.  This will be a new special Oireachtas committee comprising Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The Whip will sit down with Opposition Members to discuss the structure, membership and nature of the committee.  It will be a matter for the committee to define its own terms of reference in what it needs to do here.  Obviously, comments have been made about three modules - the lead-up to the bank guarantee, the issue of the banks themselves and the State institutions.  It will be a matter for the committee, when it has been appointed by the House and by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to define what those are.  The Deputy asked when the banking inquiry committee will actually get down to business and start doing work.  He will be aware that there is a pretty serious amount of preparatory work to be done here.</p><p> I assume the banking inquiry, through the system, could be operational by the end of September or October.  It should be finished its preparatory analysis by then.  It is important for everybody to find out what happened, and the truth and the impact of light regulation by the previous Government.  The Whip will consult the Opposition and we hope to bring a motion before the D&aacute;il and Seanad next week and get on with the business.</p></speech>

Depending on the timescale the committee wishes to give it, it may wish to examine the lead-up to the bank guarantee.  It may wish to treat of the banks and institutions of the State and their responsibilities and roles individually or together.  That is a matter entirely for the committee and the members to define the terms of reference, with approval from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, and given the authority by the D&aacute;il.  We will follow that from the motions before the House next week.  As I said, I expect the committee could be up and running by late September or early October, having gone through detailed and complex preparatory analysis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000029#BB02000"><p>I have tabled these amendments, relating to a ban on the on the use of sunbeds for people with skin types I and II, based on Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, I thank the Irish Cancer Society for framing these proposed amendments, and I hope the Minister of State has had the opportunity in the intervening period to give the good sense behind the amendments her due consideration and, I hope, her support.  The amendments take the form of new sections as set out in the amendments, which are also tabled in the name of Deputy Kelleher.</p><p>  I hope the Minister of State has carefully examined the proposals and that she will be in a position to advise of their acceptance.  These amendments would prohibit those with the fairest skin types, types I and II, from using sunbeds in &quot;designated sunbed business settings&quot;.  The Bill can only directly refer to such settings, and one would hope that in any other setting, people would use their good sense and not use sunbeds at all.  The majority of Irish people are of skin type I or II, and that is just a fact of who we are and where we live.</p><p>  There are international comparisons.  In Australia, people with skin type I are prohibited from using sunbeds and I expect that also applies in related settings.  In proposing the inclusion of both these amendments, we want to ensure that the people most at risk are protected.  The Bill as drafted addresses the issue of young people but we also want to ensure the greatest protection for people of the fairest skin types.  Sadly, this requires small terms, including prohibition, if we are to achieve the necessary result.</p><p>  I have no doubt that the Minister of State knows that cancer incidence is projected to double by 2040.  That makes for disturbing reading, and the fastest-growing number of cancers are expected to be skin cancers.  As the Irish Cancer Society has indicated, sunbed use is as carcinogenic as smoking and plutonium.  Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in Ireland and in 2010, some 9,450 people were diagnosed with skin cancer in Ireland.  Of those, 896 people were diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.  There were 158 deaths from skin cancer in 2011, and as the Irish Cancer Society has stated, there is a very clear link between this rise in skin cancer and sunbeds.  The international agency for research on cancer in July 2009 placed sunbeds in the highest cancer risk category, indicating they are as carcinogenic as the use of tobacco and plutonium.</p><p>  Every year, up to 28,000 young people in Ireland put their lives at risk by using sunbeds.  Although I cannot extrapolate numbers for the broader use of sunbeds, if a majority of the population are of skin types I and II, more than 50% of adult use would be putting their lives at risk.</p><p>This is a huge issue which requires as stoic and determined an address as that shown by the Minister and Ministers of State regarding tobacco use.  I commend amendments Nos. 1 and 2 in my name and that of Deputy Kelleher.  I hope when the Minister responds she will indicate that she accepts them for the very good, sane and sensible reasons I have given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000030#CC00200"><p>I raised this issue on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is straightforward.  I understand the complexities and difficulties it poses in respect of over-18s, who have freedom of choice.  It is, however, important to table the amendments to highlight the need to address this issue.  If it cannot be addressed in legislation, it should be addressed by some form of regulation that would impose obligations on sunbed operators emphatically to inform people with skin types 1 and 2 that they are more likely to contract melanomas by the use of sunbeds.</p><p>  I know the Minister of State envisages this but the Irish Cancer Society has strongly urged us to highlight the issue because there may be a lack of awareness in the broad population of the dangers sunbeds pose to people, particularly those with skin types I and II.  I, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Irish Cancer Society and others who advocate awareness in the battle against various forms of skin cancer have made the point that there is still a lack of awareness among some cohorts of people of the dangers of excessive, or indeed any, use of sunbeds and from exposure to the sun.  People do not take precautions, as we see time and again in summertime, even in Ireland where people are surprised to find that ultraviolet rays are present when it is cloudy.  When we go abroad, we are obsessed with tanning to the point of endangering our health.  For all those reasons there is merit in the thrust of these amendments to highlight our concern, and that of the Minister of State and the makers of public health policy, to develop some system that imposes a clear obligation - not one in small print but one that is well-defined and publicised - on sunbed operators to inform those more prone to contract skin cancers of the danger of exposure to ultraviolet radiation, particularly through using sunbeds.  There should be an advertising campaign around this issue.  We are all at one in advocating and supporting policies that cut down on the threat of developing cancers.  We support the efforts made in public health policy on smoking, alcohol, where maybe more should be done, and sexually transmitted disease, and many other areas.  This issue, however, seems to need a higher awareness level.</p><p>  As we speak we are coming into a time when kids will be herded into tanning shops all over the country in preparation for first holy communion and confirmation.  The Minister of State is as aware of this as I am.  This Bill hopefully addresses the concern for those under age, putting inspection regimes in place with prosecutions for those who breach the legislation.  I accept that people over 18 are entitled, and have a right, to use sunbeds.  I tabled this amendment to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, given that the Minister said on Committee Stage he was very conscious of this and would take it on board in some way.  I am anxious to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000030#CC00300"><p>Who could disagree with these arguments?  We know and see the obsession not just in tanning shops, but on our beaches every year and when we go abroad, with coming back a different colour.  Unfortunately, in my case that will never happen.  I am probably skin type I or II, as are the majority in this country.  We have to realise that we should not be out in the sun.</p><p>  There is a clear need for an awareness campaign.  We all accept now that smoking is bad for us although it still happens, but hopefully at a reduced rate.  People still drink too much although there is a recognition that they should not.  We are only beginning to become aware of skin cancer, in respect of exposure to the sun, ultraviolet rays, tanning parlours and sunbeds.  There is value in these amendments on that issue.  Both Deputies, however, will understand that we cannot put them into legislation because we have to accept that people have a right to behave in a way that has consequences down the line.</p><p>  We accept the argument of the Irish Cancer Society.  Under EU legislation and our equality legislation, we cannot discriminate on the basis of skin type.  It seems self-evident that people of my skin type should not use sunbeds or go out in the sun but people feel they have a right to do so.  All we can do is protect those whom we are legally obliged to protect, those under 18.  There will be an obligation on the owners of tanning parlours to display notices outlining exactly the type of person who should not use sunbeds.  The customer will be asked does he or she understand the rules and to sign confirmation of this.  The operators must retain these documents for two years.  They will also have to display a notice of the effects and dangers of using sunbeds, and a health warning.  On top of this, they must comply with the regulations as written.  There will be inspections and significant on-the-spot fines and court appearances if they do not comply.</p><p>  The Deputy is quite right to point out that as we speak we are coming up to a time when children are being prepared for first holy communion and confirmation.  In the past few years, thankfully, they have moved to using artificial tan rather than sunbeds but it happens.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in knows this too.  This Bill will prohibit that use.</p><p>  These two amendments which, unfortunately, I cannot accept, for the reasons I have outlined, will draw to the attention of people who are over 18 the need to know their skin type and that they should not be out in the sun.  We have to accept that we must allow that type of freedom to people who are over 18.</p><p>  The Minister apologises for his absence.  He is in Greece on official business; otherwise he would be here.  I am sure he dealt with all of this on Committee Stage.  We cannot accept the amendments for all the reasons I have outlined but they are well worthwhile because they draw attention to the type of public awareness that people should have.</p><p>  The Fitzpatrick chart exists but we cannot discriminate on the basis of skin type.</p><p>We will be advising the operators of sunbed parlours about the skin types of which they should be aware.  We will also pursue a public awareness campaign along with the other agents involved in this area, including the Irish Cancer Society, the National Cancer Control Programme and the HSE.  Individual agencies and organisations have developed their own awareness campaigns but we will also make a co-ordinated effort to raise awareness.  However, we can only administer legally on behalf of those we are obliged to protect, namely, people under the age of 18 years.</p></speech>

We would achieve equality by banning them outright.</p></speech>

Discouragement and disseminating information are useful but, sadly, further measures are required in the context of public health.  If a measure has been successfully employed in another jurisdiction, it is not beyond our gift to undertake a similar approach.  A number of states in Australia require tanning shops to carry out skin type assessments prior to allowing a person to use a sunbed.  Interestingly, the scale employed is called the Fitzpatrick scale.  There must be an Irish connection.  Apparently the Fitzpatrick scale is universally recognised and can be easily employed in such settings, whether in Australia or in Ireland.</p><p>  The evidence shows that Ireland already has a significant problem with skin cancer and the projections and statistics suggest that the challenge will double by 2040.  I cannot contest that claim but those who make it are well informed of developing trends in public health and the Irish Cancer Society fully supports it.  Those at greater risk need higher levels of protection.  Cautions will not be sufficient.  We should be prepared to go the extra mile and people will appreciate that we are doing so in their collective interest.  Every person who avoids the process of treatment represents a significant saving in terms of public outlay on health costs.  Prevention is the way to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000031#DD00500"><p>The Minister of State referred to regulations and the obligation on proprietors of tanning shops to inform customers of the risks.  I assume the customer is also obliged to read and sign a disclaimer to show he or she understands not only the terms and conditions, but also the risks.  Sometimes it is said we have a lot of laws.  It is a question of enforcing them and, more important, educating people so that they understand and comply with the law.</p><p>  Although the climate in Australia is very different, the skin types are very similar due to our shared genetic background.  Australia operates strict regulations for children playing in school grounds which require them to wear hats and protect their shoulders and arms.  We do not need to be as extreme but we must be conscious that the vast majority of Irish people are unaware of the dangers of the Irish sun.  In Inchydoney during the first week of June, irrespective of whether it is fine or overcast, one can see people who are sunburnt because they do not understand the dangers of ultraviolet rays even on a cloudy day.  We need to develop a public health policy for awareness raising and an aggressive campaign to highlight the dangers.  I hope the Minister of State will take that on board by rolling out a campaign in a targeted way to children as well as adults.  It is often the case that children impart knowledge to their parents about these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000031#DD00600"><p>In regard to public awareness, I am often astonished not so much so see that adults are burning, but that they have removed protective clothing from their own children.  In regard to the lack of knowledge about preventative measures to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred, it is more likely that damage will be done to children under the age of 12 years because of the way in which their skin develops.  That is the age group we are considering seriously.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to Australia.  The obvious solution would be an outright ban but the difficulty is that we are close to other jurisdictions.  For example, there is nothing to stop someone in the Deputy's county from ordering a sunbed across the Border and having it delivered to his or her door.  That happens on a regular basis.  This Bill would require such an individual to operate the sunbed according to the laws of this country, even though the equipment came from a different jurisdictions.  We must also abide by the Constitution and EU legislation.</p><p>  Given my skin type, I am well aware of the dangers arising.  It is a question of public awareness and this legislation will begin that process.  Many people are aware of the dangers of ultraviolet rays but others are not.  The risks do not arise solely in this country.  There is a notion that people can go to Spain to throw themselves under the sun for two weeks.  Those two weeks do more damage than anything we can do in this country.  However, even though we do not have great summers or intense sunshine, we should none the less protect ourselves between April and September.  It is not as if we are immune just because we avoid sunbeds or do not travel abroad.  There is a process of education involved but the only people we can protect are those under the age of 18 years, and that is the purpose of this Bill.  I am not saying that we will never go further but for now this is as far as we are prepared to go.  I believe this is a significant Bill in the context of protecting children.</p></speech>

I will not labour the point.  It is clear that this is not something the Minister of State believes she can progress at this time.

I hope that good public sense would increasingly prevail and that this is an issue that would self-regulate by virtue of people staying away.  That is one way to bring it to a close.</p><p>  I have already indicated I support the legislation and will support its passage.

It is therefore proposed to delete the word entirely from the section.</p><p>However, as the Minister for Health explained on Committee Stage, to substitute &quot;safe&quot; with &quot;authorised&quot; might suggest that the legislation gives tacit approval or authorisation to the use of sunbeds which is clearly not the intention of the Bill.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000032#EE02100"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  The aim of the Children First Bill 2014 is to improve the care and protection of children by raising awareness of child abuse and neglect.  The Bill represents a national change and a quantum shift in child protection.  The Bill moves the issue from one where ignorance was bliss - except for suffering children - to a position where ignorance is no longer tolerated.  It moves the issue from one of good intentions to one of concrete obligations.  It moves the issue from vagueness to precision and it moves from a culture of &quot;should report&quot; to one of &quot;must report&quot;.</p><p>  This is a child-centred Bill which delivers on a key programme for Government commitment.  Children First, the National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, were first published in 1999.  For 12 years they operated as the overarching national guidelines for individuals and agencies that come into contact with children.  In 2011, following a national review of the guidelines, I launched the revised Children First: National Guidance.  The decision to place Children First on a statutory basis is a commitment in the programme for Government and arose from a recommendation in the 2009 Ryan report implementation plan.</p><p> The Children First Bill 2014 will, for the first time, provide for key elements of the Children First guidance to be put on a statutory basis.  I want to make it clear that the Bill will operate side by side with the existing non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  I also want to make it clear that the Bill forms part of a suite of legislation which should be considered together, including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.</p><p> The Bill has three key elements.  The first element obliges certain professionals and others working with children to report child protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency and to assist the agency in the assessment of a child protection risk, if requested to do so.  I can state with a confidence based on the best thinking, nationally and internationally, that the Bill strikes the right balance - the right balance between a high quality reporting system by mandated persons on the one hand, while not overwhelming the system with the over-reporting that has happened in other countries.  This balance I suggest is central to making Ireland a safer place for children.</p><p> The second key element of this Bill obliges providers of services to children to undertake an assessment of any potential for risk of harm to a child while that child is availing of their services and to prepare an appropriate child safeguarding statement in accordance with the Bill.  The third element provides statutory underpinning for the Children First inter-departmental implementation group which will promote and oversee cross-sectoral implementation and compliance with Children First.  This group, which includes a representative of each Government Department, will be required to keep the implementation of this legislation under review and to report on an annual basis to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This will ensure a continued focus on the implementation and compliance task until best practice becomes the absolute norm.  That is the objective - to move from the horrors of where we were 20 years ago to a situation where - let me repeat it - best practice is the absolute norm.</p><p> On the whole, this Bill represents an important addition to the child welfare and protection measures already in place and will help to ensure that child protection concerns are brought to the attention of the Child and Family Agency without delay.</p><p> This Bill reflects the outcome of significant consultations over the past two years, including hearings on the previous heads of Bill conducted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The Bill I am bringing forward has benefited considerably from the report of the joint committee's hearings and significant changes have been made to the earlier heads of Bill.</p><p> I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, provide for the Short Title and commencement, definitions - there are very important definitions in regard to abuse, neglect and harm to children which are spelled out very clearly - regulations and expenses.  Section 5 provides that the Minister may issue and publish guidelines for the purpose of providing practical guidance in respect of the protection and welfare of children and any such guidelines in force at the time of commencement of this section shall be deemed to be guidelines issued by the Minister under the Act.  Section 6 provides that the Child and Family Agency shall, in performing a function under the Act, regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.  It is absolutely appropriate that in legislation like this, the best interest of the child should be considered the paramount consideration.  </p><p> Section 7 provides for definitions of &quot;contract of employment&quot;, &quot;personal relationship&quot; and &quot;provider&quot; in Part 2 of the Bill.  Section 8 provides that Part 2 of the Bill, regarding child safeguarding statements, is not applicable to an individual who undertakes any work or activity in the course of a family relationship where the work or activity is undertaken solely for the benefit of his or her child or a family member or where the work or activity is undertaken in the course of a personal relationship or where assistance is given on an occasional basis for no consideration.  This is a practical arrangement given that many of the requirements of the child safeguarding statement have to do with the recruitment, selection, vetting and training of staff and the procedures in place for the reporting of harm by staff and the listing of mandated reporters.</p><p> Section 9 provides that a provider of relevant services is to ensure that, as far as practicable, a child, while availing of its services, is kept safe from harm.  &quot;Relevant services&quot; includes work or activities mainly involving access to or contact with children.  &quot;Harm&quot; in regard to a child means &quot;to assault, ill-treat, neglect or sexually abuse the child and may be caused by a single act, omission or circumstance or a series or combination of acts, omissions or circumstances or otherwise&quot;.</p><p> Section 10 provides that where a person proposes to operate as a provider of relevant services, he or she shall, within three months of the commencement of the service, carry out a risk assessment and prepare a child safeguarding statement.  A person operating as a provider of relevant services immediately prior to the commencement of the Act shall carry out a risk assessment and prepare a child safeguarding statement not later than three months from the date of commencement of the Act.</p><p> The section provides that a child safeguarding statement shall include a written assessment of risk, including an outline of the procedures in place to manage any risk identified and an outline of the procedures in respect of an employee who is the subject of investigation in respect of any act or omission with regard to a child.  The section also provides that a child safeguarding statement shall include an outline of procedures in place for reducing any identified risk, including procedures for the recruitment of staff, for the provision of information, instruction and training in regard to the identification of harm and for the reporting to the Child and Family Agency by an employee or by the provider.  The child safeguarding statement shall also include a list of persons in the relevant service who are mandated persons.</p><p> Section 10 also provides that a child safeguarding statement is to be made available to members of staff, to parents or guardians, to the Child and Family Agency and to members of the public and the child safeguarding statement or a review of the statement is to be displayed in a prominent place related to the relevant service.  The section also provides that the Minister may make regulations in regard to child safeguarding statements.</p><p> Section 11 provides that certain professionals and other persons in specified occupations, as listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill, are mandated persons for the purposes of the Act.  The persons who have been identified as mandated persons are those whose professional education, training, expertise, or the nature of their specific role in certain organisations prepares them to be aware of the risks to children and their responsibilities.  </p><p> This section sets out the circumstances whereby a mandated person is required to make a report to the Child and Family Agency.  The section provides that where a mandated person knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is being harmed, has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, he or she shall, as soon as practicable, report that belief or suspicion to the Child and Family Agency.  Where a child makes a disclosure to a mandated person that he or she believes that he or she is being harmed, has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, that mandated person shall, as soon as practicable, report that disclosure to the Child and Family Agency.  Mandated persons will not be required to assess the veracity or credibility of such disclosures.  Obviously, they will make a professional judgment.</p><p> A mandated person shall not be required to make a report to the Child and Family Agency where a young person aged 15 years or more, but less than 17 years, is engaged in sexual activity with a person who is not more than two years older than the young person and where the mandated person knows or believes that there is no material difference in capacity or maturity between the two parties, where the child has made known his or her view that a report should not be made to the Child and Family Agency and where the mandated person relied upon that view.  This section does not apply where the child has made a disclosure of harm to a mandated person.  Also, a mandated person is not required to make a report where the sole basis for his or her knowledge, belief or suspicion of harm is as a result of becoming aware that another mandated person has made a report to the Child and Family Agency in respect of the child concerned.</p><p> A mandated person is only required to make a report if he or she becomes aware of the information after the commencement of this section, irrespective of whether the harm occurred before or after the commencement of the section.  However, the Children First National Guidance will continue to apply in parallel to the legislation and under the guidance all reasonable concerns regarding harm to a child should be reported to the agency.</p><p> The report is to be made to the agency on a mandated report form.  It can be made by one mandated person or jointly with one or more mandated persons.</p><p> A report may be made other than on the mandated report form where a mandated person has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child may be at risk of immediate harm.  However, the mandated person must, within three days, provide a report to the Child and Family Agency on a mandated report form.  The Minister may make regulations regarding the procedures for the making of reports to the Child and Family Agency.</p><p> The section also provides that reporting obligations under the section are in addition to and not in substitution for any other obligations that the mandated person has to disclose information to the Child and Family Agency.  This does not give rise to a requirement to make more than one report, other than where there is considered to be a risk of immediate harm.  The section also provides that any other obligation a person has to disclose information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 or to any other person or under any other enactment or rule of law is not affected by the provisions in the section.</p><p> Section 12 provides that the chief executive officer of the Child and Family Agency shall authorise a member or members of staff for the purpose of receiving reports made by a mandated person.  The section also provides that an authorised person shall be deemed to be a designated officer within the meaning of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 for the purposes of that Act.</p><p> Section 13 provides that a mandated person may be requested to assist the Child and Family Agency and to give such information and assistance to the agency as is reasonably required by the agency and the section also provides that a mandated person shall comply with such a request.  Assistance to the agency by a mandated person includes the provision of verbal or written reports, attendance at meetings arranged by the agency and the production to the agency of any document.  That is very helpful in terms of assessment and inter-agency co-operation.</p><p> The section also provides that the Child and Family Agency may share information concerning a child who is the subject of a report with a mandated person who is assisting the agency but the sharing of that information shall be only as considered by the agency to be necessary and proportionate in the circumstances of the case.  The section provides that, for the purposes of carrying out its functions under this Part, the Child and Family Agency shall have the same powers as it has under the Child Care Act 1991 or under any other enactment in respect of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</p><p> Section 14 provides that information shared during the course of an assessment shall not be disclosed to a third party and it is an offence if the person does that.  Section 15, which is a very important section, provides that the Child and Family Agency is a specified body for the purposes of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, which has implications for employment.</p><p> Section 16 provides that section 9(4) of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 is amended to include a reference to the Children First Act 2014 to provide for the views of the child to be taken into account by the Child and Family Agency in performing its functions under the Children First Act.  Section 17 provides for the establishment of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group to perform functions assigned to it under the Bill.  Section 18 spells out the membership of the implementation group.</p><p> Section 19 provides that the functions of the implementation group are to ensure compliance with the legislation, that various Departments support the intention of the legislation, that there is a consistent approach and that reports to the Minister are made when requested on how the Act is being implemented.  This is a very important power to evaluate and monitor the implementation of the Act.  The Minister may give a direction to the interdepartmental group asking it to comply with a policy of the Government as specified in the direction.  The terms and conditions for appointment of membership are also spelled out, as are the details relating to the conduct of meetings and the provision of an annual report in sections 21, 22 and 23.</p><p> Section 24 is very important from the point of view of cross-departmental work in that it provides that each Minister of State shall publish a sectoral implementation plan concerning relevant services provided by the Department concerned and concerning relevant services provided by a body that is in receipt of funds from the Department.  It is clear that there are implications for funding if it is found that organisations are not compliant with the legislation.  The relevant Minister shall cause copies of his or her plan to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after the preparation of the plan.  That is very important as well in terms of monitoring and evaluating precisely what is being done by each Department.</p><p> I emphasise that the Bill forms part of a suite of child protection legislation, including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  By revising the heads of the Children First Bill in July 2013, my Department was able to take cognisance of the provisions of both of those pieces of legislation which were enacted in 2012 to ensure that all three interact in a complementary manner.  The previous heads of Bill provided that a mandated person who, without reasonable excuse, did not report a concern of harm was guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months and, in addition, that person was to be reported to his or her relevant regulatory body.  Although there was not a consensus on the issue, the Oireachtas joint committee in its report did express concerns that criminal sanctions could result in over-reporting, thereby potentially delaying the prioritisation of higher risk reports and placing the child welfare and protection system under undue pressure.  Consideration of international comparisons also suggested that this is an area where a careful balance must be struck.  There are diverse approaches to who is mandated, what they are mandated for, and what kinds of sanctions apply.</p><p> Finally, having regard to the other legal constitutional considerations, it was clear that there was a need for a reasonable and proportionate approach.  While it is envisaged that persons mandated to report will meet their statutory obligations without the necessity to impose criminal sanctions for non-reporting, there are criminal sanctions for withholding information from the Garda under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  In addition, there are a range of other potential penalties including passing of information to the national vetting bureau where following an inquiry a view is taken that a mandated person put a child at risk by not making a report to the agency under the Act; a complaint to the professional body, including regulatory bodies fitness to practice committees, for any regulated professional; and a report to an employer and resultant disciplinary measures.</p><p> The Bill will operate side by side with the Children First guidance which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns.  The guidance is being revised to provide clarity and to ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society.  Departments have already developed sectoral implementation plans to drive implementation across the relevant sectors and the work has been proceeding well.  Through the existing group, the Child and Family Agency has been working with the individual sectors to assist them in developing an information and training needs assessment process.  This work and the provision of information and training have been ongoing in many sectors recently in anticipation of the legislation.  I pay tribute to the many diverse organisations which have provided training for their members and volunteers.  There will be, just as there has always been, a requirement for information and training across sectors.  This will now be managed strategically by all sectors in the context of existing departmental sectoral plans with the advice and co-operation of the Child and Family Agency, which has already put a lot of work into training and support.</p><p> I wish to make one final point, namely, that we must never, ever - even with the best legislation and radically improved systems - think of child protection as something that happens &quot;over there&quot; and is dealt with only by mandated persons or experts.  Each and every one of us has a responsibility to safeguard children - to cherish more than our own sons and daughters.  That will never go away, and should never go away.  The Child and Family Agency is there to offer support to anyone with child protection concerns on how to deal with those concerns.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000034#GG00200"><p>Having consistently called for the Children First Bill to be published and introduced in this House over the past two years, I obviously welcome the fact that we are where we are this evening, that the Bill has been published and we have an opportunity to debate it.  I welcome elements of the Bill in so far as it goes.  However, that welcome is strongly tempered by disappointment and concern that the new Children First Bill does not include any sanctions for those who refuse to report child protection issues.</p><p>On assuming office, the Minister, together with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, promised that Children First was their number one priority but it has taken three years to bring forward what Emer O'Kelly rightly described in the<i>Sunday Independent</i>two weeks ago as &quot;a toothless Bill&quot;.</p><p>Before turning to the Bill, it is important once again to deal with the repeated efforts of the Minister to give the impression that children's rights were not taken as seriously before she and the Government took office three years ago.  No one can deny that the country had a less than admirable record regarding child protection and welfare during the 20th century.  However, attitudes have changed immensely over the past 20 years.  The Child Care Bill 1991, enacted by Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, introduced considerable changes in respect of children in care and improving the child care policy previously regulated by the Children Act 1908.  The then Minister pointed out how political and administrative structures had changed, how new values and attitudes had evolved and that there was more sensitive understanding of the psychology and needs of children.  In particular, he cited how there was a greater awareness of the rights of a child as an individual member of society.</p><p>Attitudes to children have changed considerably over generations.  There was an old saying that children should be seen and not heard but even when I was growing up, that was regarded as an old saying.  A clear focus on children and child-related issues has accelerated in this century and members of the public and previous governments have come to focus on children and child-related issues.  This change in focus has been incremental and substantial and not only in recent years as the Minister would have us believe.</p><p>In 2000, the then Government published the first national children's strategy while, in 2002, legislation was enacted to establish the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to provide an independent mechanism to vindicate the rights of children.  The establishment of such an office was in recognition of the need for an independent person to act as a powerful advocate for children and promote the welfare and rights of the child.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Office of Ombudsman for Children and Ms Emily Logan's appointment.  I congratulate her and her staff on their immense contribution over the past ten years.</p><p>In 2006, the Government appointed the first independent Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  This was also an important development and I welcome that the original appointee was reappointed by the Minister.  In 2005, the Minister of State with responsibility for children was given a place at Cabinet and, in 2008, the previous Government also established the first Office of the Minister of State for Children and Youth Affairs.  Obviously this was not a full Department but it put in place the infrastructure for such a Department under the current Government and we welcome the fact that the Minister for children is a full Minister now.</p><p>Much of the preparatory work for the referendum on children's rights was done by the previous Government and a cross-party Oireachtas committee on which the Minister and Deputy &Oacute;'Caol&aacute;in served.  I have previously complimented the Minister on ensuring a referendum was put to the country and the result was a significant achievement, which ensures the rights of children are enshrined in our Constitution.  However, she jeopardised the campaign by other actions and almost 18 months after its passage, the practical implementation of the result remains stalled.</p><p>I have provided brief background details to demonstrate that reforms and a change in attitude were not confined to the past two years.  This incremental and substantial process has been ongoing for the past decade and needs to continue for many years.  Let us consider where we are now and the reforms being brought forward by this Minister.  I want to be constructive but I am struggling to find something positive to say about this latest legislative initiative, which confirms a pattern of action under the Minister's tenure.  She seems to over promise and under deliver; great on rhetoric but poor on delivery.  The recent published Aftercare Bill is restrictive and discriminates against the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.  The legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency omitted two of the critical services recommended by the task force the Minister established to advise her.  Despite the &quot;Prime Time&quot; expos&eacute;, &quot;Breach of Trust&quot;, relating to child care settings, inspectors have still to be appointed in some regions.  The Minister amended the period within which inspections must be carried out.  Previously, they had to be carried out annually but this was extended to triennially recently and we ware still waiting on the new standards to be published almost 12 months on.</p><p>I am not surprised that the latest initiative from the Department is yet another U-turn on a solemn commitment made by the Minister and her Government colleagues.  To his credit, the Minister for Justice and Equality has carried through on what he promised and he has introduced the legislation that will enhance child protection, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, although we are still awaiting the commencement order for the latter.</p><p>I have consistently called for the legislation to be published over the past two years and I welcome the fact that we are debating it now.  The Minister will say others promised it as well but, for her part, she promised it on a number of occasions.  Sadly, the lack of sanctions in Bill represents a watering down of the robust legislation that was promised.  It is hard to believe that this is the best legislation the Minister could come up with three years on from her describing the legislation as her top priority.  The rhetoric of her reforming agenda lies in tatters with this inadequate legislation.  It was described by Emer O'Kelly in the article to which I referred as follows:<blockquote>We have been saying 'never again' for a very long time. And this ridiculous watered-down Bill doesn't even say that. It is merely a blanket to attempt to muffle the sounds of weeping, anguished children. Shame on us; and shame on our Government for our and their indifferent hearts and empty words.</blockquote>This Bill is supposed to end a culture of turning a blind eye to child abuse and other child protection issues.  While professionals working with children will be legally obliged to report concerns, there will be no legal penalties if they do not.  The legislation, therefore, lacks teeth.</p><p>This is a major U-turn by the Government.  The heads of the Bill, when published two years ago, included robust sanctions for failure to comply with the Children First legislation.  The guide to the heads of the Bill stated:<blockquote>Head 20 provides for offences under the Bill and for the liabilities attaching. A person is guilty of an offence if he or she is required to report concerns or allegations of abuse under the proposed Bill to the HSE and fails to do so. A person guilty of an offence will be liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</blockquote>This is absent from the legislation, which is disappointing.  Following two years of protracted delays and with no meaningful explanation, we appear to have ended up with a watered down version of the original Bill.  There will also be no sanctions against organisations that fail to have child safety statements in place.</p><p>Children have waited too long for these guidelines to be put into law.  There is no point in the Minister patting herself on the back claiming that she is finally doing something that was first promised 15 years ago if she will not back it up.  There is no room for tokenism or half-hearted efforts.  We need a bold step that ensures people are forced to speak up when children are vulnerable to abuse or neglect.  Surely what has led to the introduction of introduce this legislation is what is described in the Ryan report as the lack of consistent and uniform implementation of the Children First guidelines.  Will this legislation remedy this fundamental fault in our child protection system?  Together with many of the NGOs working at the coal face, I am concerned about the absence of sanctions for those who fail to comply with the provisions in this Bill.</p><p>This is not just partisan political posturing; there is widespread concern among many organisations and stakeholders about what is not in the Bill.  Following the Bill's publication, the Saving Childhood Group, comprising Barnardos, CARI, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Empowering People in Care, EPIC, the ISPCC and One in Four, issued a statement welcoming the Bill but also highlighting concerns.  They drew attention to the fact that no sanctions are in place for those who fail to comply with the requirements set out in the Bill.  They also pointed out the list of mandated professionals should include those working in organisations focused on child protection, welfare and rights services  They went on to mention there is no reference in the Bill to retrospective allegations.  The Saving Childhood Group also drew attention to the fact that the level of resources required to ensure all stakeholders, in particular parents, are informed and can act in an informed way is not outlined.</p><p> The CEO of the ISPCC highlighted his concern that the list of mandated professionals does not cover national organisations whose main purpose is working with children and families.  He stated: &quot;while so many organisations and services are doing great work and already adhering to best practice, many large service providers including my own organisation, the ISPCC are not explicitly mandated to comply with the protocols set out in the Children First Bill.&quot;  He also rightly pointed out that it is imperative all organisations providing services to children, whether statutory or non-statutory, are obliged to take a consistent approach to ensure the best possible responses for children.</p><p> The CEO of One in Four emphasised the sanctions issue, making a compelling case that such a long-awaited Bill, which seeks to provide for the reporting of child protection concerns and to ensure statutory and non-State funded bodies are legally obliged to follow protocols in reporting any concerns regarding the safety and welfare of a child, does not include clear sanctions for failure to comply and without this it is hard to see how a completely consistent approach from all will result.</p><p> I do not believe the Bill can be described as providing for mandatory reporting, as promised by the Minister and her colleagues.  This is because a key ingredient of a mandatory reporting system is a requirement to report child abuse on a reasonable suspicion and on threat of a penalty or sanction.  I am struggling to understand the Government's U-turn on this, given the provisions of head 20 of the draft Bill published more than two years ago.  This provided for a term of imprisonment of up to five years and would have represented a strong deterrent to those who fail to be vigilant with regard to child protection.  Head 20 also envisaged the imposition of a significant monetary penalty.  The Minister seemed to suggest this was international practice and cited New South Wales as an example.</p><p> I have examined the provisions of other common law jurisdictions with regard to failure to follow child protection guidelines.  In Canada, which is often referred to as the most progressive jurisdiction for child protection legislation, the fine which can be imposed ranges from $2,000 to $50,000.  Most Canadian provinces impose a prison term of six months, with a term of two years in Ontario.  Prior to 2008, Ontario did not impose a prison sentence but is now doing so.  The evidence, with the exception of New Zealand, seems to suggest a penalty is the most effective way of ensuring compliance with child protection.  Another example is Florida in the United States, which introduced a similar penalty to that introduced in the original heads.  Some states, such as California, provide for greater penalties for second offenders.</p><p> This legislation is about safety of children.  Let us consider other safety legislation.  The crucial difference between this legislation and health and safety legislation is the fact that health and safety legislation imposes prohibitive penalties.  Why do organisations which fail to provide a health and safety statement face penalties while organisations which fail to provide child safety statements do not?  What signal does this send out?  What does it say about our commitment to child protection?</p><p> My greatest fear was confirmed by the Minister's statement at a recent Oireachtas committee meeting that she did not wish to overburden the system.  As with so many of her decisions, quality legislation is being sacrificed in the interest of securing savings, a far cry from &quot;never again&quot; in the aftermath of the reports published in recent times.  We should not be limited in how we respond to child protection concerns by questions of administration.</p><p> At an Oireachtas committee meeting before Easter, the Minister spoke of a suite of legislation already in place, but the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act deals with a much higher threshold.  It caters for people who deliberately and recklessly conceal information, not those who might have suspicions of abuse or neglect and fail to report them.  The Minister also publicly stated this issue was dealt with by professional bodies under misconduct procedures.  This is simply not the case as no professional body can impose a penalty in excess of that provided for by law.</p><p> My concern is the real reason the Minister does not wish to overburden the system is a resource issue.  Let us face it: the Bill does not only need the power of sanction to be effective, it also needs resources.  I am concerned that no additional resources are being provided to implement the measures in the Bill.  The introduction of reporting of allegations of child abuse must be backed up with adequate resources to handle all cases of suspected abuse.  There cannot be a properly functioning child protection structure in the State if our system cannot handle allegations that are reported to the authorities.  It is crucial that the Child and Family Agency is sufficiently resourced to assist parents and professionals understand and support the implementation of the law.  This concern is shared outside the House.  Tanya Ward of the Children's Rights Alliance pointed out the legislation would be more robust if greater resources were made available.  The fact is we will fail vulnerable children throughout the county if we allow this legislation to pass into law without a robust regime to back it up.  Mandatory reporting can only achieve its objective of protecting vulnerable children if there are enough trained workers to handle suspected abuse cases.</p><p> When mandatory reporting was introduced in the Australian state of New South Wales, there was a sixfold increase in the number of reports made.  We cannot end up in a situation whereby additional reports clog up an already overburdened social work system, leaving vulnerable children at risk.  The Minister must outline what additional resources she plans to deliver to ensure that every single allegation is thoroughly investigated and that every single suspected victim gets the care he or she needs.  She must also commit to HIQA inspections to ensure full compliance.</p><p> There is much in the Bill which I endorse, such as the best interests of the child being the paramount consideration.  No one can disagree with the requirement of all organisations providing services to children to have a child safeguarding statement which details policy and procedures on child protection.  The Children First interdepartmental group to promote compliance and monitor implementation by a variety of Departments is welcome, as is the obligation on the authorised person in the Child and Family Agency to respond in writing to all reports made.</p><p>I reiterate that provisions without enforcement are meaningless and note that under the proposed Bill, specific individuals have a legal duty to report child protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency.  However, what happens if they fail to so do?  Nothing.  Does the Minister agree that all children, regardless of their early education or child care setting, should have the same protection provided by this legislation?</p><p> The Bill includes early years services as defined by the Child Care Act 1991 and includes any work or activity which consists of the provision of care or the supervision of children.  Schedule 2 includes both providers and the staff members in preschool services as defined by the Child Care Act 1991.  However, for as long as most childminders remain outside the scope of the aforementioned Act, the Children First Bill cannot be applied to them.  This is problematic, as children in home-based child care, that is with childminders, should receive the same protection as those in centre-based child care.  Childminders may care for children for long hours, often all day, in the childminder's home, typically with little supervision or support.  There are major child protection concerns regarding the lack of regulation and the absence of requirements for Garda vetting or child protection training for most childminders.  At the same time, as individuals who have close and frequent contact with young children and their families and who play a large and active role in children's daily lives, childminders are well placed to identify concerns in respect of children's welfare at home.  To ensure all children have the same level of protection, regardless of the child care setting, would the Minister consider amending the list of mandated persons in Schedule 2 in order that it explicitly includes paid childminders who are not relatives?</p><p> I will bring forward amendments to try to improve and strengthen the legislation and hope the Minister will consider them positively.  Chief among them will be the reintroduction of meaningful sanctions for those who fail to comply.  Moreover, the Minister is on notice that unless she accepts sanctions, she and her Government colleagues will be obliged to vote against penalising those who fail to comply.  When this law was first envisaged, it was designed as a line in the sand - that is, something that would end a culture of turning a blind eye to child abuse and other child protection issues.  The Minister has stated that she would undo the neglect of previous years and Administrations with this Bill but she has under-delivered.  I acknowledge that she has been meeting the NGOs and various interested parties, from some of which I quoted earlier.  Hopefully she will listen to them and will use Committee and Report Stages of the Bill to provide what was promised.  I certainly will provide her with the opportunity to so do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="19:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000037#KK00200"><p>I welcome both the publication of this important and long-awaited legislation and the opportunity to address it.  The topic of the mandatory reporting of knowledge or suspicions of the harm or abuse of children has been an issue in Ireland since the early 1990s.  It was first recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 1990 and later by the Kilkenny incest inquiry in 1993, slightly more than 20 years ago.  In 1999, the Department of Health introduced the Children First guidelines, which aimed to help in identifying and reporting child abuse and to improve professional practice in State and voluntary agencies that support children and their families.  The duty to report abuse was identified as a societal one that is owed by all who work with children, including members of the Garda, HSE personnel, public agencies, voluntary and community organisations and individuals.  However, the guidelines did not place a statutory duty on these people - on all of us - to report suspicions of abuse or harm.  I emphasise the latter point, which is that it is the duty of all.</p><p>  The implementation and operation of Children First were reviewed several times during the years after its introduction, most recently by the  Office of the Minister for Health and Children in 2008.  The revised guidelines published in 2011 took into account a number of recommendations in the Ryan report.  One of those recommendations was that Children First should be placed on a statutory basis.  This is something I fully supported at the time and have urged on the Minister.  Moreover, I have supported her in her efforts to bring it about in the period since then.  The Bill before Members sets out to make further and better provision for the protection of children and places the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing.  As the Minister indicated in her opening remarks, it is part of a child protection framework that includes the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  It will require certain persons or service providers to carry out specific functions including the making of reports to the Child and Family Agency in respect of children in certain circumstances and assisting the Child and Family Agency in certain circumstances.  It also will require them to carry out risk assessments regarding potential harm to children and to prepare child safeguarding statements.  Provisions of the Bill also establish the Children First interdepartmental implementation group and provide for the preparation of sectoral implementation plans by Departments.</p><p>  As for the distinct provisions of the Bill, I note that a number of stakeholders particularly welcomed aspects thereof, including the statement of the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, the requirement for all organisations providing services to children to have a child safeguarding statement that outlines policy and procedures with regard to child protection, the establishment of a Children First interdepartmental implementation group on a legislative basis, the purpose of which will be to promote compliance and monitor implementation by various Departments, and the requirement for the authorised person within the Child and Family Agency to respond in writing to all reports made.  At this juncture, I also wish to record my welcome of the inclusion of these measures.</p><p>  Part 3 of the Bill deals with reporting and sets out in detail who is obliged to make a report and in what circumstances.  There are a number of distinct elements making up the obligation to report and each must be present for the obligation to exist.  I note the list of mandated persons and the degree to which there has been comment that the definition of mandated persons is not sufficiently wide to cover those working in organisations focused on child protection, welfare, rights or services.  Some concern exists that already has been alluded to, not least that stated by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, to the effect that the list of mandated professionals does not cover national organisations working with children and families as their main purpose.  While so many organisations and services are doing great work and already are adhering to best practice, many large service providers, including the ISPCC itself, are not explicitly mandated to comply with the protocols set out in the Children First Bill.  It is my personal view that it is imperative that all organisations providing services to children, whether statutory or non-statutory, be required to take a consistent approach to ensure the best possible responses for children.  The only way to ensure such consistency is for the same requirements to apply across the board.  I urge the Minister to consider extending that list to include those organisations and service providers to which I have referred.</p><p>I note that the specific definitions used in the Bill differ significantly from those in the Children First guidelines of 2011 and the general scheme of the Bill from 2012.  There is potential that this may lead to confusion about what type of harm or abuse should be reported.  I urge absolute clarity in this regard.</p><p>On a separate point, I welcome the provision in section 11(3) which clarifies the situation discussed in detail during the joint committee debate on the heads of the Bill regarding the distinction between consensual sexual activity and abuse.  Many of my committee colleagues and I expressed concerns about lack of clarity as to when peer sexual activity between teenagers is or is not consensual in the eyes of the law.  There was general but not unanimous support for the view that the Bill should not require reporting of consensual peer sexual activity between teenagers, as that could inhibit recourse to sexual health and advice services that seek to reduce teen pregnancies and underage sexual activity and to promote sexual health.</p><p>I note that it is not an offence under the Bill to fail to report suspicions of harm to children and there are no sanctions for failing to do so.  This is in direct contrast to the heads of the Bill.  During our deliberations on the heads of the Bill in the Joint Committee on Health and Children, only a minority of contributors were of the view that criminal sanctions were not appropriate.  That is my recollection.  I understand that there are differing opinions in relation to sanctions, with many arguing that the threat of sanctions may lead to a complete bombardment of false reports on an already under-pressure system.  Indeed, it has been brought to my attention that evidence of the effectiveness of criminalisation in other countries is unconvincing at best, and the reversal of the legislation in New South Wales provides some testimony to this.  In addition, a number of European countries have also relied on civil, rather than criminal, sanctions for failure to report.  I remain unconvinced, however, and I will take further opinion from my own team before considering Committee Stage amendments.  Regardless of how we seek to address this on Committee Stage, it is my strongly held opinion that the current service is simply inadequately staffed.  This is an important point.  I know that the Minister and many of her colleagues are discomfited by references to resourcing, but I believe it is critical to have this addressed, and urgently, particularly given the number of children without an allocated social worker, which remains a problem, the level of reporting and the worsening nature of the issue of child abuse, neglect and maltreatment.  It continues to present and heaven only knows the extent of what is not showing.</p><p>Health Service Executive data shows a trend of increased reporting of concerns about child welfare and protection, with a 36% rise in reports between 2007 and 2011, amounting to 31,626 reports in 2011.  Indeed, the HSE has acknowledged the existing pressure on the system.  I refer to the 2011 review of the adequacy of child and family services:</p><p>As for many other areas in the public sector at this time, the budget allocation does not reflect this increased demand and the reality is that the resource base will be under significant pressure in the years to come.</p><p>The challenge facing the new Child and Family Agency is further evidenced through research on child protection data by Helen Buckley, associate professor of social work at Trinity College, which shows that the situation is worsening.  In a stark statement she said:<blockquote>[O]n the basis of available intelligence, we know that in Ireland we have growing numbers of children who are neglected and emotionally harmed, and a lesser but significant number of children who are seriously maltreated.</blockquote>These statements re-emphasise the point that adequate resources to give practical effect to this legislation are essential; otherwise, while we are not wasting our time, we are certainly not reaching the goals that we have set ourselves, and, sadly, children will continue to suffer.  Without any hesitation I assure the Minister she will have all our support in her efforts to have her Department and the services provided by the Child and Family Agency better resourced in the future.  This is essential.</p><p>I do not intend to use all my speaking time  I will conclude my remarks by raising some additional points of concern which may require address on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to take note of some of my remarks when she makes her concluding contribution on Second Stage and to offer some clarification.</p><p>The first point of concern is inter-agency co-operation.  I ask the Minister what assurances can she give that the Child and Family Agency can depend on the level of co-operation that will be forthcoming from the health, justice, education and social protection services in order that the Children First Act can function effectively.</p><p>I refer to a recent reply to a parliamentary question in which the Minister addressed the issue of the nature and detail of the memorandums of agreement between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other agencies.  The Minister's response raised as many questions as it answered.  This is an area that will require further clarity.  I ask the Minister to avail of the opportunity at the close of Second Stage.</p><p>Second, the issue of training is of concern.  Research indicates that child protection training at basic and post-qualifying levels is essential for professionals working with children.  Irish research indicates that not only is child protection training almost wholly inadequate at foundation level but it is also deficient at post-qualification level.  The absence of training prevents the development of a culture of responsibility for child protection in an agency and leaves staff lacking confidence and unsure of the correct steps to take.  The business of identifying and addressing child protection concerns is not straightforward and practitioners need a strong base of knowledge and information before they are competent to respond.  Recent cutbacks have resulted in training being curtailed in many children's services and this is likely to have a serious impact on the positive aspects of the proposed legislation.  This issue needs concerted and urgent attention.</p><p>My colleague, Deputy Troy, referred in his contribution to the fact that the Saving Childhood group has raised some concerns about the Bill, including some of those already outlined in my contribution.  Like me, the group has concerns that there is no reference in the Bill to retrospective allegations and the fact that there is no outline of the level of resources required to ensure that all stakeholders, particularly parents, are informed of the new requirements and can then act in an informed way.  The publication of this Bill is a welcome development.  I will be happy to work to ensure its safe and timely passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The concerns I have outlined are raised with the intention - as also raised by non-governmental agencies - of making the resulting Act as robust and as fit for purpose as possible.  I view the Bill as a joint piece of work.</p><p>I look forward to its implementation and hope that over time it will demonstrate its real value, because this is important work.  </p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Bille seo.  I will give it my wholehearted support through the various Stages and endeavour, in conjunction with the Minister, to ensure any amendments that will make a worthwhile contribution during its passage will be presented for consideration.</p></speech>

While I warmly welcome and support the Bill, I find it difficult to participate in a discussion on legislation to put children first when the Government and Minister are doing nothing to support an excellent child care service in my constituency.  Without the Minister's help and support in finding &euro;100,000 in funding in the coming weeks, the Jigsaw centre in Darndale will be forced to close down.  I raised this issue recently with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in the absence of the Minister.  The Darndale and Belcamp integrated child care service is an excellent facility.  Two weeks ago, I had the honour of being brought around the centre by board member Barbara Quinlan and the centre's manager, Kelda Barnes.  I was immediately impressed by the top-class and high-quality care provided and the professionalism and commitment shown by its staff to 260 children from the local community.  It is important that the Minister, her officials and Deputies hear directly from me about the valuable work done by the service. </p><p>  The Darndale and Belcamp integrated child care service was opened in 2001.  It was initially planned to cater for a maximum of 150 children from birth to 12 years.  The facility consists of playrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and sleeping rooms.  Over the years, the centre has evolved into the largest cr&egrave;che in the country and currently caters daily for 260 children, 90% of whom are from the immediate area, namely, Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview.  The local area is recognised as disadvantaged and includes a large Traveller community.  One sixth of the children attending the service are young Travellers and the centre employs one core staff member and eight community employment participants from the travelling community.  Some 100 people are directly involved in the project.</p><p>  I am hopping mad about the sad news we have heard about the centre.   Last Thursday, representatives of the service met representatives of Tusla.  They explained the constraints applying to the funds provided by F&Aacute;S, which are purely for wages for F&Aacute;S participants and training and material costs.  Funds allocated from the early childhood care and education free preschool year programme, ECCE, and community child care subvention programme, CCS, are based purely on child numbers and the status of parents.  Tusla is the only funder which has discretion to allocate funding based on the needs and predicaments of children.  The facility caters for the real needs of the community, as Tusla is fully aware.  While the organisation fully supports the work being carried out in the centre, its bottom line is that it does not have sufficient funding to financially support the centre and is unable to prevent its imminent closure. </p><p>  I urge the Minister to put children first in this project.  She must immediately consider this urgent case and link up with the centre.  Its closure would have serious consequences in an already disadvantaged community.</p></speech>

There is a serious disconnect between debates on legislation and people on the ground.  Children are suffering and people need a few bob.  At a time when some of those who wrecked the country have no problem obtaining money, and others such as consultants are paid very large sums, we cannot find &euro;100,000 for a project that caters for 260 of the most disadvantaged children in the country.  I demand that the Government provide support for the children in question.</p><p>  The Bill will require certain mandated persons to make reports to the Child and Family Agency of harm to children and require certain persons to assist the agency with assessments.  It will also require certain service providers to carry out risk assessments in respect of potential harm to children and prepare safeguarding statements.  These are welcome developments.  We need to get on with the job and introduce legislation to protect children in all walks of life.</p><p>  Since its introduction in a number of US states in the 1960s, the concept of mandatory reporting has evolved, with the categories of persons who are obliged to report expanding from health care professionals to other professionals and in some cases including all citizens.  The types of reports of abuse have also been expanded to include sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse and neglect.  Some jurisdictions have moved from a requirement to show serious harm towards a requirement to show more general harm, including potential abuse.  There are significant variations in many of the jurisdictions with regard to who is bound to report and what types of abuse must be reported.</p><p>  A consistent criticism of mandatory reporting is that it generates such an increase in reporting that it can threaten to overwhelm those who assess the reports and places pressure on often under-resourced services.  While we all understand that services are under-resourced, children must be given the maximum priority.  For this reason, I welcome this legislation. </p><p>  The number of reports involving concerns about child welfare and protection increased by 36% to 31,626 between 2007 and 2011.  Numerous factors contributed to the increase, including the growing population of children and the economic downturn.  It is acknowledged that more children are placed at risk when economic conditions are poor.  Moreover, awareness and concern about child welfare have increased among members of the public, partly due to the findings of various inquiries into child abuse - a positive development in that sense - and related systemic failures.  The Children First guidelines and related educational efforts have also been successful in alerting professionals to recognise and report concerns for children.  </p><p>  I commend those working on the front line who have been involved in cases of child abuse.  As the Minister is well aware, these are very difficult circumstances to deal with and frequently involve threats.  I am aware of many cases in which threats of violence were made against people who tried to assist children living in dysfunctional families.  </p><p>  Another issue that is constantly ignored in the broader debate is the abuse of children and young adults with an intellectual disability.  The silence on this issue is deafening.  As someone who advocates for the rights of people with disabilities, I find it frightening to realise that many of their stories have never been told.  The many stories that have been told have made a major contribution to creating a more enlightened culture and opened minds to supporting children at risk.  However, many cases did not reach the top table, specifically those involving children with intellectual disabilities, whose voices are often not heard.  Moreover, some of these people do not have the capacity to report about their cases.  It is important that the Minister keeps her eye on the ball on that particular issue.</p></speech>

The Children First Bill is trying to undo many legacy issues that are fundamentally about the failure of the State in the past.  In years to come, will we be resolving the matter of housing provision where we are seeing men, women and children on a routine basis becoming homeless?  How is the State putting those children and their families first?</p><p>  I have permission to refer to the likes of Grainne Mallon, who was made homeless in Sallins last week and interviewed on KFM this morning, as well as the mother and children who are sleeping in a car in the Newbridge area who will be interviewed tomorrow on the same station.  It is appalling that people have to put themselves out so publicly at a time of such stress, leaving themselves open to be the subject of debate and ridicule by those who, I hope, will never find themselves so exposed.  This week alone, I am dealing with 12 cases of homelessness, ten of which are families with children.  Unfortunately, there is another ten families with notice to quit that will be added to the list in the coming week or weeks.  Every day people are turning up at my office with the same problem.  In the first three months of this year, Kildare County Council dealt with 80 families.  Its homeless budget is exhausted.  For most, there will be no hostel, no bed and breakfast or temporary accommodation.  Instead, they will be told to find a relative or a friend with a couch.</p><p>  I am talking about people like Jessica who is due her baby in a couple of weeks.  She was given notice early in January and she presented homeless to Kildare County Council.  She has a four year old daughter who is in junior infants.  Until January, Jessica was in college but has had to drop out.  She has chased every available rented property and has widened her field of search into all the neighbouring counties.  When I met her first she was optimistic and confident.  Now, she is stressed out, fearful emotional and tearful.  She is now refused maternity payments because she has no address.  She has been admitted to hospital twice in the past couple of weeks.  She should be looking forward to her new baby; that should be her major concern.  The irony is the hospital will not let her leave when she has the baby if she has no baby seat in the car but will do nothing if she has no home to go to.</p><p>  Julie is a part-time worker and is expecting twins in six weeks.  She presented homeless in March.  She and her daughter are on the housing list since 2005.  She and her child are staying temporarily with her mother who has a tiny one-bedroom flat.  She is stressed out, not the condition in which a pregnant mother should be.  Where is the concern for these unborn children and these young women?  Emma and her partner have two children, one of which is three months old.  They have been on the housing list since 2008.  Their landlord is being forced to sell the house by the bank.  This couple have been searching day and night for the past three months for alternative accommodation which is simply not available.  Again, how is the State putting these children first or even considering their needs?  These are functioning families who care deeply for their children but are being failed when they most need the support of a compassionate State.</p><p>  Why is this occurring?  It is because there is a shortage of housing.  Low-income families must rent because they will not get a mortgage, yet renting is often the more expensive option.  The more wages are driven down, the less discretion people have to purchase a home.  Accordingly, renting is the only option and will continue to be.  High rents are also impacting on those at work.  Rising rents are sucking money out of low to middle income workers which will inevitably impact on the economy.  That is why countries like Germany control rent increases because the cost of shelter can be damaging to the competitiveness of the economy.  Even in the USA rents are controlled.</p><p>  There are 90,000 individuals or families on the housing waiting list nationally.  Half of them, 45,000 are located in three counties or just six local authority areas, three in Dublin, two in Cork and Kildare.  These are the very same locations where the pressure on rents is at its highest.  In the absence of local authority or housing association builds, the only option for those who earn just above the limits to qualify for the housing list is to rent.  However, rents are becoming increasingly unaffordable to all.  Those in receipt of rent assistance are finding it increasing impossible to find accommodation with an increasing number of landlords refusing to accept rent assistance.  Some of this is due to the complicated process but mostly it is about the rent caps.  They are way below the market rents in many locations.  People are routinely topping up or paying the difference to the landlord under the table.  Focus Ireland told the environment committee recently that the Department of Social Protection was turning a blind eye to fraud.  It is the poor who are the subject of this fraud, however.</p><p>  The same organisation discussed the issues of unaffordable rents and topping up, issues on which it had done some good research, with the Department in 2012.  The Department looked for the names of people who were topping up.  When Focus Ireland asked what the Department would do if given the names, it stated it would stop their rent assistance.  In other words, it would make them homeless.  Despite the denials of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, top-ups are a widespread occurrence.  She knows it and to say otherwise in this Chamber is to mislead the House.</p><p>  What are the solutions?  The Government must first accept there is a crisis.  The Government's amendment to this motion confirms to me it is in denial.  It needs to look at the facts and stop believing the spin.  It must review the very flawed system of rent caps.  The British model is much more nuanced.  The community welfare officers must be allowed to use more discretion to prevent people becoming homeless which often saves money.  The Government must resolve the issues for the housing associations that will make it possible to draw down up to &euro;500 million from the European Investment Bank.  It needs more than a voluntary regulation code and it may mean the Government has to underwrite some of the loans.  We need to grow up and realise we need a strategy for the provision of housing, where both the public and private sector have a role and where an affordable and secure public rental sector is part of the housing mix.  We need to address the crazy procurement policies for local authorities which often mean it can take six months to re-let local authority housing units.  There are 49 such houses in Kildare which could be re-let but will not be available for months.</p><p>  In many ways, the crisis that started with the economic crash in 2007 is worse now than ever before.  The impacts have been deferred but are being felt in a real way now.  The issue of unsustainable mortgages has got to a point that we are going to see largescale repossessions, adding thousands more to housing waiting lists that stand at 90,000 families.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment &quot;welcomes the Government's commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2016.&quot;  How will it do this?  We deserve to know how.</p><p>  The problem is getting worse by the night with people and their children sleeping in cars.  We are better than this.  I believe we are more humane than this.  What is occurring is not acceptable to any right-thinking person.  Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, Threshold, the Peter McVerry Trust, Crosscare and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have said there is a crisis.</p><p>The Simon Community has said it is beyond a crisis and is heading towards a disaster.  It is a real tragedy for the people who are the subject of it.</p></speech>

This represents a 30% increase on the 2007 figure.  One in five of these people has been on the list for more than five years.  The combination of cuts to rent allowance and other social welfare payments, the increase in rents and the introduction of zero-hour contracts is putting tenants in the private rental market in an impossible position.  I discussed the need for rent control with the Minister of State recently.  I believe we should take a serious look at what our German and French counterparts are doing in order to better protect tenants and prevent landlords from hiking up rents.  Almost one third of all buy-to-let mortgages are now in arrears, which means the tenants in these properties find themselves in a very unclear position.  To whom should they pay their rents?  What are their rights if the banks decide to increase their rents?  I note that Threshold has called for the Residential Tenancies Act to be amended to ensure that when receivers take control of properties, they step into the shoes of landlords and assume their responsibilities.</p><p>A basic search on a website like <i>daft.ie</i>quickly shows how difficult the situation has become for people who depend on rent allowance.  Most advertisements indicate that the landlord will not accept rent allowance.  In my constituency of Wexford, the maximum rent limit under the rent supplement scheme for a single person living in shared accommodation is &euro;250 a month.  When a member of my staff searched <i>daft.ie</i>yesterday, she found just three properties that meet this criterion.  All three advertisements stated clearly that rent allowance would not be accepted.  I suggest that it should be illegal for landlords to refuse tenants who are in receipt of rent allowance.  According to the Department of Social Protection, some 80,000 people are receiving rent allowance.  Many landlords are excluding these people from the private rental market.</p><p>Vulnerable young people are among those most adversely affected by current Government and landlord policies.  Even if they can find a landlord willing to accept rent allowance, they are likely to be priced out of the market due to the rent limits imposed by the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the price increases.  Social housing and private rental accommodation are two of the main exits out of homelessness.  Both are essentially unavailable to homeless people in the present climate.  The significant barriers that are preventing homeless people from accessing the private rental market are leaving most such people trapped in emergency homeless accommodation.  Rents in Dublin have increased by 18% since 2011.  The level of rent allowance payable by the Department of Social Protection has fallen by 28% in the same period.</p><p>As Fr. Peter McVerry has said, the 90% drop in social housing output between 2007 and 2011 has resulted in a 100% increase on the social housing waiting list.  The number of people on the list increased from over 43,000 in 2005 to almost 90,000 today.  Fr. McVerry has pointed out that the Government's allocation of funding for the construction of 449 new homes over the next two years would reduce the waiting list by 2% if the list was not growing all the time.  It clear that the Government does not have a coherent plan to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis.  When John McManus wrote about the rapid increase in Dublin house prices in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently, he argued that &quot;policy in this area continues to be made on the hoof and is vulnerable to all the special pleading and political lobbying that served the public interest so badly the last time around&quot;.  He continued:<blockquote>The rapid increase in Dublin house prices clearly took the Government by surprise.  It also seems to have no idea what is the root cause of it and thus what is the solution.  As a result, vested interests have filled the vacuum and seem to be driving the policy response.</blockquote>It has been admitted that 10,000 new social housing units will be needed each year if this crisis is to be dealt with.  According to an article in today's <i>The Irish Times, </i>the national total for the number of local authority houses built last year was just 293.  By comparison, some 5,000 social housing units were built in 2007, bad and all as things were at the time.  The article points out that &quot;The State has handed responsibility for providing homes for social welfare recipients over to a private sector that, now it no longer needs them, doesn&rsquo;t want them&quot;.  Fr. Peter McVerry said recently that &quot;after 30 years of working to eliminate homelessness, I believe the problem is now worse than ever, perhaps even out of control&quot;.  Is the Government actually interested in building the number of social housing units that are required?</p></speech>

As far as I can recall in my lifetime, none of its predecessors chose to take this approach.  It is essential that control over property and development land does not remain in the hands of a small group of people in the private sector.  The small group of people who own the land will continue to control the prices unless the Government decides to regulate and control it.</p></speech>

Every Government backbencher knows that we are talking about an absolute crisis of proportions that have probably not been seen for decades.  The Minister of State will not serve the citizens well by denying that truth or by interrupting Deputies.  Equally, it is unacceptable to ask where the necessary moneys might be found given that tens of millions of euro have been handed to the banks.  It is twice as unacceptable for a Labour Party Minister to act in such a manner.</p><p>  It is demoralising in some ways that we even need to have this discussion.  Given that we have been able for decades to send people to the moon or wherever, that we are able to send unmanned drones over thousands of miles and that our society has accumulated greater wealth than at any time in our previous history, it is almost overwhelming that we are living in an era when one of the most basic human rights - the right to shelter - is seen as too much of a luxury.  That is what is happening not in a so-called Third World country, but in a so-called advanced capitalist country, which has been through an unprecedented boom, much of which centred on the construction industry.  One really could not make this thing up.</p><p>  A room over someone's head is more than bricks and mortar - it is a human right.  The delivery of housing should be a starting point because it is the foundation of so many other aspects of life, such as human health.  We know of citizens whose mental and physical health has been irreversibly destroyed by being forced to live in inadequate accommodation.  All of us know that children's education is suffering because their parents have to uproot them from their communities on a regular basis when they have to start all over again in new areas.  Those children will never recover from that.  This affects all aspects of life.</p><p>It is an absolute indictment of neoliberal capitalism.  The Minister will have heard the joke that after our construction boom we will be the first generation to stand in a field with our children and say we remember when this was all houses.  It is the legacy of an unregulated market in which houses were built on flood plains, were falling down around people because of pyrite, were built without regard to fire hazards, and so on.  It was the same lack of regulation highlighted by the judge in yesterday's court case.  It is proof positive that the free market does not work.  The only way the housing crisis will be solved is through a massive State-led programme to build and regulate the housing market.  We are paying the price of an over-reliance and over-facilitating of the private sector to deliver housing.  As a result, some people have become very wealthy while other people's basic needs are not being met, and the greatest scandal in some ways is that the State is paying more for an inadequate service.</p><p> The Government has made much of the point that we live in constrained times.  The Minister of State made the point that we have not got the money.  However, the rot started long before her Government came into power.  I was a councillor in Fingal County Council for 13 years and even during the boom the State house building programme was incredibly limited.  One of the key reasons was the failure to implement the Kenny report and control the price of building land.  Yet we spend hundreds of millions of euro every year subsidising the private rental sector rather than delivering a national house-building programme.  The excuse for house building the Government is putting together is pathetic.  First, we need to recognise that there is a crisis.  That has not been the Government's approach, nor has it been the approach of the Minister of State so far tonight.</p><p> All of us have been presented with devastating cases.  For the first time in many years as a public representative, I and my staff have had to tell people there is nothing we can do because there are no houses available in the range of prices of Government rent supplement levels.  Even if there were, the landlords would not take rent supplement.  This discrimination against people in receipt of a welfare payment has not been outlawed by the Government, which is disgraceful.  Not enough houses are being built.  We are telling people they have been on the list only six years.  People have to choose whether to move from their areas, uprooting their children from their schools; to lie and make up the difference themselves - which we all know everybody does - to the tune of hundreds of euro, pauperising their families; or to go into homeless accommodation, which is totally inadequate and costs the State more.</p><p> I could have spent my whole seven minutes talking about tragic cases from my area.  A young family with a son in a wheelchair was forced into homeless accommodation and moved miles from their area and their son's special school.  A woman with three children is living in her car.  A young mother who gets nothing is spending &euro;930 per month on a one-bedroom unit for her children.  Couples with children are in city centre hostels and are bringing those children to school in Swords.  This is absolute lunacy.  We need to address this matter.</p><p> While I do not have time to develop the points, one way of not addressing the crisis is by failing to deal with people who are in housing but struggling with their mortgages, failing to address what the banks are doing, and adding to the homeless list.  We need rent controls.  Everybody else can do it; I do not see why we cannot.  We need to immediately address the inadequate levels of rent supplement.  We need to deal with the mushrooming of voluntary housing agencies, which should be investigated.  Why can the local authorities not be empowered with the capital to build houses?  Why do we need these multiple housing agencies?  One of them took out a loan of &euro;2 million to get new city centre offices when it already had a city centre office.  How many chief executives are there and how many millions of euro are we wasting on that system?  We are talking about lives, and the Government's response has been hopelessly inadequate.</p></speech>

It is contemptuous.  It is arrogance personified.  It is appalling.</p><p>  When I was mayor of Waterford three years ago, a young couple whom I have known since they were 15 years old came in to me and said they had lost their house.  The week before that they had sold their television and a few weeks before that they had sold their car to try to keep their house.  The banks did not listen and put them out of their house.  The girl collapsed on the floor, which the ushers in Waterford City Council can confirm, and had to be helped and given tea and water.  I met that girl a few weeks ago and she is destroyed because she has lost her house and is still in rented accommodation.  If the Minister of State saw the appalling accommodation she is in, it would make her sick.</p><p>  The Minister of State calls herself socialist and left wing.  She is not, because she has not met people who are dying while they are living because of the conditions in which they live.  The Minister of State has no compassion.  She can shake her head all she likes.  The Government side of the Chamber is empty while we discuss housing, while people are sleeping in cars, crying and becoming ill, while children are becoming disabled and 200,000 children are living in poverty.  The latest statistics report that one in five children are living in poverty.  The Government should call an election, fall and be put out of office because of how it has treated the 90,000 people on the housing lists.  Everybody here would welcome an election even if we lost our seats because the Government would be put out of office, and deservedly so because of the contemptuous way it has treated people.</p><p>  Decent people in the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would agree that when we leave this Chamber on Thursday or Friday and return to our constituencies, our advice centres will be inundated with housing cases, including homeless people, people in poor housing and people not able to get rent allowance or who are waiting four or five months for it.  Can the Minister of State imagine the despair in which people live?  At the beginning of time, when man and woman settled, the two necessities for survival were a house and something to eat.  In 2014 more people than ever are homeless and on the housing list, 200,000 children are hungry and nearly a quarter of our population are unemployed and hungry.  Those are facts, and the Government's answer is to have two Deputies in the House - one in the Chair and the Minister of State.  It is outrageous.  I am disgusted.  I do not want to say anything else.</p></speech>

Part of me feels we could have just left it at that, because then we might have come to a general consensus that there is an emergency and a crisis that will worsen unless it is dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p><p> We know the facts which have been highlighted by many of us here, in the media and by those directly involved in housing provision.  In particular, I will consider three issues, the first of which is local authority housing in Dublin.  There is just not enough available to meet demand and we know that little or no housing is being built.  There is an excessive and unacceptable number of voids in potentially good accommodation in flat complexes and estates; some of these properties are left for far too long, even years, without occupants.  I know that &euro;15 million has been released to deal with this issue, but it is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed, particularly given what I see in Dublin Central.  We know that sufficient funding is not available to provide the required social housing.  We can see how we have ended up, despite all the tax incentives and breaks in the so-called good years.  The ghost estates are inaccessible, with no transport, services or schools.  </p><p> In the case of private accommodation, I am very critical of the landlords I have seen in Dublin Central.  I accept that there are responsible landlords, but I have seen too many rogue landlords with tenants at their mercy.  They have no concern whatever for the condition of the property they rent and many are still not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  As they do not follow up on subletting, there is serious overcrowding, as well as health and safety issues.  These landlords are being let off the hook on social and environmental issues and although some tenants demonstrate serious anti-social behaviour or do dreadful damage to communities, they are allowed to terrorise elderly citizens.  Such individuals do the absolute minimum in disposing of rubbish, meaning that there is a massive problem in the north inner city with illegal dumping.  The Dublin City Council intensified inspection scheme has thrown up appalling results, but it is not moving fast enough to get landlords to tackle the issues involved.</p><p> We all know about the rents issue and some rates are out of proportion to what is being paid for.  Stopping rent supplement before tackling rents was incomprehensible.  There should have been legislation to bring down rents before looking at rent allowance in a proportionate way.  As a result of demand, rents are increasing in the private rental sector; landlords have the pick of tenants and those on rent allowance are ending up homeless.  There is also the increase in the number of landlords who will not accept tenants on rent allowance.  If people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of gender or ethnicity, why are they being discriminated against on the basis that there are in receipt of rent allowance?  I do not begrudge people the &euro;500 million being rolled out for broadband provision in a large number of towns and villages in rural Ireland, but some people in this country do not have a roof over their heads and they certainly do not have broadband when they do not have a home.</p><p> I am struck by three elements of the Government's amendment.  The Government has indicated that it recognises the high priority it has assigned to housing and homelessness issues, particularly in the housing policy statements from 2011 and 2013.  If the issue was a priority, we would not be having this debate or what Fr. Peter McVerry has termed a &quot;tsunami&quot; coming down the road.  A second element of the amendment indicates that the Government supports the adoption of the housing-led approach to tackling homelessness, etc. but that is aspirational.  We have not seen results but rather an increase in homelessness, with no concrete plans to put in place a strategy to reduce the numbers who are homeless.  For example, people come out of rehabilitation with addiction issues, albeit clean and moving into accommodation that is drug-free.  As a result of the crisis, those who still use drugs and are living chaotic lives are imposed on such individuals, meaning that the mix is a recipe for disaster.  The Department of Social Protection has indicated that there is no evidence regarding top-up rent payments, although it accepts that there are reports on the practice.  As we all know that it is happening, I do not know what other evidence can be sought.</p><p> I will mention the docklands issue.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is reviewing Part V of the Planning and Development Act and there is a fear that the provision stipulating that 20% of housing be allocated for social use will be eliminated.  </p><p> With regard to section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, the 20% of Spencer Dock housing promised for social purposes has not been delivered.  The question is whether it will ever happen and it will not if the Part V provisions are dropped.  There must be an onus on NAMA, when it releases properties, to have a guaranteed percentage which could even be higher than 20% to be allocated for social housing and money should not be substituted.  Strategic development zones in the docklands could be used for housing or community purposes, but they are being lost.  This Friday a piece of land right beside the social housing complex will be auctioned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, but they are not getting a chance to bid.  Who will take over this piece of land?</p><p> Simon Communities recently made an interesting submission to the committee of which I am a member, making 14 specific recommendations, one of which concerned the slow transfer of housing from NAMA.  In the budget the projection was for the release of 4,500 units, but, to date, 518 have been transferred.  Much more could be done in this regard.  Simon Communities also mentioned a stimulus measure to promote private housing, with mechanisms to improve access to finance for approved housing bodies.  Another initiative working in other countries involves allocating resources towards prevention, with an early warning system for those who are in danger of being made homeless.</p><p> The housing issue is tied to employment, health and community well-being.  There was a perception that this would never happen again, but it has.</p><p> I will finish with a quote from a politician who stated, &quot;The most serious social tragedy not just in the capital city but throughout the country must be the scandalous housing situation.&quot;  The late Tony Gregory said this on 18 May 1982, as he referred to housing waiting lists, substandard and grossly overcrowded conditions and speculation or profiteering in building land.  If we go back to the 1930s housing crisis, the banks stopped it being addressed and the issue was not resolved until to the 1940s.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p></speech>

The chronic problem is exemplified in County Kerry by the alarmingly high numbers on local authority housing lists.  The Kerry County Council waiting list includes 1,292 qualified applicants, while the list for the council in Tralee stands at 1,779.  The list for the council in Killarney stands at 894 and the list for the council in Listowel, 147.  Many have been on the waiting list for between seven and ten years and there is certainly a sense of despair and frustration.  Numerous people have given up hope and if they go to clinics or council housing offices, they come up against a closed door.  There is an opportunity for the Government to make the necessary funding available to local authorities.  That will naturally create an economic position that will lead to the provision of much-needed work, with spin-off advantages.  We should look at the positives.</p><p>  In my own county in 2013 two houses were completed and work on two more was commenced, while four houses were acquired through the provision in planning legislation.  The number of vacant houses coming on stream is also quite low.  If there is a vacant house, the time in the council getting the keys from the previous occupant, carrying out repairs and engaging in refurbishment can be lengthy.  The Department should liaise with all councils and accelerate the timeframe for getting new tenants into houses.  It is shameful to see properties locked or sometimes boarded up.  We must address the issue immediately.</p><p>  The rental accommodation scheme in County Kerry catered for 112 families on the waiting list in 2013.  There is much merit in the scheme, but the 18 month qualification period should be reduced to six, as this would have a positive influence and expedite the provision of short to medium-term solutions for many on the waiting list.</p><p>The Government should take cognisance of the social housing assessment carried out by the local authorities countrywide last year.  That study assessed 89,872 households as qualifying for housing support.  The corresponding figure in 2008 was 56,249.  This is a dramatic increase of 33,000 or more in five years.  This must be rectified.  The increase cannot be allowed to continue at that rate.  Over half, 52%, of the households which qualified for social housing support were categorised as dependent on rent supplement.  The next cohort, of over 20,000, or 23% was categorised as unsuitable accommodation due to particular circumstances.  These statistics demonstrate the need for the Government to act with speed.  This motion proposes that the Government start to build over 80,000 new houses over the next five years, as detailed in the report of the Housing Agency.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;acknowledges that the economic downturn and contraction in construction activity since 2008 has created significant difficulties for many communities and individuals across Ireland;<br /><br />recognises the high priority which the Government has assigned to housing and homelessness issues, particularly in the housing policy statement published in 2011 and the homelessness policy statement published in 2013;<br /><br />recalls that the Government, in its housing policy statement, recognised that a radically different approach to the provision of social housing was necessary as the prevailing financial parameters would not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded local authority housing construction programmes in the short to medium term;<br /><br />recognises that, with the more limited resources available, the main focus in terms of housing supports provided by Government must be on meeting the most acute needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources;<br /><br />in terms of overall funding and delivery of housing supports, welcomes:<br /><br />&mdash; the fact that some &euro;575 million is being provided by the Government in respect of the housing programme in 2014, effectively maintaining funding for housing at 2013 levels;<br /><br />&mdash; the announcement by the Minister of State with special responsibility for housing and planning of the intention to return to mainstream local authority housing construction in 2014 and, in particular, the announcement of a &euro;100 million construction programme over 2014-2015 that will enable local authorities to construct approximately 600 new social homes;<br /><br />&mdash; the provision of a &euro;15 million funding stream to bring vacant and boarded up local authority units back into use, which will provide some 950 homes for families on housing lists;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish shortly the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which, when enacted, will provide a legislative basis for the new housing assistance payment, which will be of significant benefit to long-term recipients of rent supplement; and<br /><br />&mdash; the fact that through the social housing leasing initiative, the rental accommodation scheme, acquisitions and construction programmes, mortgage to rent arrangements and the continued transfer of National Asset Management Agency units, Government supports will result in the delivery of some 5,000 social housing units in 2014;<br /><br />in terms of addressing homelessness:<br /><br />&mdash; welcomes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2016;<br /><br />&mdash; supports the adoption of a housing-led approach to tackling homelessness, which involves access to permanent housing combined with appropriate ongoing support, as a core aspect of the Government&rsquo;s homelessness policy statement;<br /><br />&mdash; welcomes the ring-fencing of Government funding for homeless services in budgets 2013 and 2014, in support of the discharge by local authorities of their statutory role in the provision of accommodation for homeless persons; and<br /><br />&mdash; notes the intention to bring forward to Government, in the coming weeks, a structured, practical implementation plan for the homelessness oversight group&rsquo;s first report;<br /><br />in terms of the private rented sector:<br /><br />&mdash; recognises that the sector is an increasingly important element of the housing market, with approximately one in five households now renting their home in the private sector;<br /><br />&mdash; recognises that resolution of the housing supply situation is a key element in restoring stability to the rental market;<br /><br />&mdash; acknowledges that the growing evidence of increasing rents, particularly in Dublin, is a cause for concern but notes that, on average, rents in Dublin are still 15.5 per cent lower than they were at their peak in the fourth quarter of 2007;<br /><br />&mdash; welcomes the Minister of State with special responsibility for housing and planning&rsquo;s request to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to carry out research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and report back with policy recommendations in that regard before the end of June;<br /><br />&mdash; notes that the Government will be introducing legislative provisions for a deposit protection scheme on Seanad Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 which will eliminate the practice of landlords illegally withholding deposits and contribute to the ongoing regulation and development of the rental market; and<br /><br />&mdash; notes that deposit protection and rent arrears cases taken together represent almost 70 per cent of all disputes referred to the PRTB and that the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 will provide an effective and efficient solution to these two significant issues;<br /><br />in relation to the approved housing body, AHB, sector:<br /><br />&mdash; welcomes the publication in July 2013 of &lsquo;Building for the Future&rsquo;, a voluntary regulation code for the AHB sector, which sets out key governance, management and financial principles that AHBs commit to meeting on signing a charter of commitments;<br /><br />&mdash; notes that the Government is currently in consultation with the AHB sector regarding the development of a regulatory framework to support the expanded role for the sector as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement; and<br /><br />&mdash; welcomes the proposal in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 to extend the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to AHB dwellings, thereby extending the same rights and obligations that are afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector to those in the AHB sector;<br /><br />acknowledges that, while the Department of Social Protection is aware of reports of the problem of illegal top-ups to rent supplement, no evidence showing widespread incidence has been presented;<br /><br />agrees that the most appropriate way of addressing the rights issue in relation to housing is to:<br /><br />&mdash; continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place;<br /><br />&mdash; secure the necessary level of funding to support them;<br /><br />&mdash; review their operation on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are meeting their objectives; and<br /><br />&mdash; put in place new programmes or measures as required;<br /><br />supports the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing in the future including through the development of a social housing strategy during 2014; and<br /><br />welcomes Government steps to address the challenges in the property and construction sectors, including:<br /><br />&mdash; developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply;<br /><br />&mdash; identifying and implementing relevant improvements in the planning process, including Part V;<br /><br />&mdash; seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision; and<br /><br />&mdash; the development of a national construction sector strategy to be finalised shortly.&rdquo;</blockquote>I wish to share time with Deputies Mulherin and Ann Phelan. </p><p>Opposition Members have referred to the fact that there are approximately 90,000 people on waiting lists but that list was growing steadily during the Celtic tiger era when there were huge sums of money in the country and the houses were not constructed.</p></speech>

There was an unprecedented boom, and I quote a member of the Opposition, but there was very little housing construction during those years when large sums of money flowed around the country and when the housing estates referred to were being built in places where there was no demand for housing.  That was because of totally inadequate planning.  We are turning that around and beginning to address the housing issue.  We have seriously changed the planning system such that what happened in the past will never happen again.  I have issued several directives to local authorities which have proposed to build, for example, on flood plains or where there is no housing demand or proposed developments that are not in accordance with proper planning.  I intend to continue to do that and to ensure that we do have proper planning, that we build where there is evidence of a demand and a need and that we do not do what was done in the last years of the Celtic tiger when terrible decisions were made and money was not spent where it should have been and unemployment grew.  Deputy Halligan referred to unemployment but we are getting unemployment levels down and it is down to an unprecedented level.</p></speech>

Since this Government came into office it has done its best to address the problems that developed at a time when the money was flowing through the country and terrible decisions were made.  We have to clean up that mess with very little money.  It is all very well to say we should be spending money and constructing houses and so on but I have not been able to do that and neither has my colleagues for the past three years because the previous Government entered into agreements that tied us down to serious cuts in capital spending and there was no way out.  That was a formal sovereign agreement, signed by a previous Government on behalf of the Irish people.  We were committed to it and we could not spend money we did not have.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the Technical Group has raised this important issue.  I accept it is a serious problem.  I do not deny it is a serious problem but I do not accept that the current Government has created it.  That attitude has been building up for several years.

That is why the housing policy statement published shortly after the Government came into office in 2011 highlighted that meeting social housing need within the available resources for the future will necessitate smarter and more innovative approaches in order to maximise output, and that the main focus in terms of housing supports provided by Government at that time had to be on meeting the most acute needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  This philosophy has informed our policies and programmes since.</p><p>  We are beginning to turn the economy around and therefore we are able for the first time to announce a mainstream housing programme, albeit limited, with the limited capital available.  Almost 70% of the entire budget for my Department this year will go directly to support housing in 2014.  The total housing allocation for 2014 will result in an investment of over &euro;0.5 billion on a range of programmes, which maintains funding for housing at 2013 levels.  I was also pleased to announce recently a return to mainstream local authority housing construction in 2014 and, in particular, a &euro;68 million construction programme over 2014 to 2015 that will enable local authorities to construct approximately 450 new social homes.  I see this as a rolling programme of local authority house construction.  I hope to add to the programme in 2015, and if possible in 2014 as well, by announcing a further tranche of new housing starts.  I also signalled my intention to approve a &euro;35 million voluntary housing programme which will deliver up to 250 new homes over the 2014-15 period.  I intend to announce details of these projects very shortly.</p><p>  An additional &euro;30 million is being invested in local authority housing in 2014.  Some &euro;15 million of this will be used to kick-start the local authority construction programme I referred to earlier.  This will be of interest to Deputy Tom Fleming, who raised this issue: &euro;15 million will fund a special measure to bring over 950 vacant and boarded-up units back into social use.  A further &euro;10 million will transform the most difficult unfinished housing estates and result in enhanced quality of life for families.  That is a legacy issue we must clean up, as Deputy Clare Daly said.</p><p>  Housing adaptation grants will also benefit by &euro;10 million and this will help older people and people with disabilities to remain at home for longer.  In all, over 5,000 social housing units will be provided for in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes.  This will include 175 new units for people with special housing needs; a further 150 new units, to be provided specifically for people with disabilities leaving institutional care through leasing arrangements; an additional 200 new homes under the social housing investment programme; an additional 950 new units from the construction stimulus package for void properties; up to 350 new transfers under the mortgage to rent scheme; approximately 850 new units through leasing arrangements; and a further 2,500 new transfers under the rental accommodation scheme.</p><p>  In the context of rising need, the priority must be to maximise delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need at good value.  It is just not possible to simply purchase or build anything like the same number of units as can be provided for through a mixture of approaches such as those outlined above.  This does not mean turning our backs on traditional modes of delivery but we must tailor those supports according to the market conditions and the financial parameters in which we are working.  Flexibility will be key to maximising delivery into the future.  I have signalled that I want us to get back into significant construction as soon as we possibly can.</p><p>  The Government's housing policy statement of June 2011 acknowledged the capacity and track record of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and placed approved housing bodies, AHBs, at the heart of its vision for social housing provision.  AHBs will play a key role in the future in the delivery of social housing and, in particular, in its capacity to attract external financial investment.  In response to Deputy Clare Daly's point, that is one of the reasons we are using AHBs.  Many in this Chamber have said very good things about organisations such as Focus Ireland and Simon etc.</p><p>I have just mentioned two but there are many more.</p><p>This recognises the record of steady achievement by the voluntary housing sector ever the last 20 years and the fact that Exchequer-funded large-scale capital building programmes are no longer financially possible, at least at this stage.  As new social housing provision will instead rely on revenue funded housing options such as leasing and on private investment into the sector, greater use must be made of the skills and expertise of the AHB sector and its capacity to attract external financial investment which will not count towards the general Government debt.</p><p>My Department is working to create a regulatory framework that will provide assurance to stakeholders that the sector is operating well, in accordance with its stated aims and that it is a sound long-term investment option.  My Department is currently in consultation with the AHB sector regarding the development of a regulatory framework to support the expanded role for the sector as envisaged in the 2011 statement.  This framework will provide support and assurance to the tenants, the boards of AHBs and their external partners that it is well regulated.  It will safeguard the investment that has been made in the sector and encourage future investment.  The first step in this regard was the publication on 15 July 2013 of Building for the Future, a voluntary regulation code for the sector that is available on my Department's website.  The code sets out key governance, management and financial principles that AHBs commit to meeting on signing a charter of commitments.  To date, just over 130 AHBs have signed up to the code.  It is anticipated that the majority of AHBs will engage with the code as it will present an opportunity to influence the final shape of statutory regulation.</p><p>In February this year I announced the establishment of an interim regulatory committee for the sector to oversee the implementation of the code and to advise on the development of statutory regulation.  The committee includes experts in regulation, housing, law and finance, and it has been constituted as an independent committee operating, for the time being, within the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  Implementation of the voluntary code will be a valuable source of information on the scope and final content of the proposed statutory regulation to be developed by 2016.  In addition, there will be widespread consultation in the normal way during the development of the new legal framework</p><p>My Department, together with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, is currently working with the sector to define more detailed financial benchmarks to which AHBs seeking private financial investment could also sign up to.  In the meantime, it remains open to AHBs to apply for external funding, whether from the Housing Finance Agency or from private lenders such as credit unions and other sources.  At least seven bodies have been certified by the HFA as eligible for loan finance with approximately &euro;40 million in loans approved. </p><p>We are also working to extend to tenants in the AHB sector the same rights and protections afforded to tenants in the private rented sector via the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  While recognising that the vast majority of AHB tenancies work very well, the rights and obligations afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector will soon be extended to the AHB sector via the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which has passed through the D&aacute;il and is currently in the Seanad.</p><p>The private rented sector is an increasingly important element of the housing market, with the proportion of households in the sector almost doubling in the period from 2006 to 2011.  Approximately one in five households is now renting a home in the private sector.  Against this background, the growing evidence of increasing rents, particularly in Dublin, is cause for concern.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, rent index for the fourth quarter of 2013 showed a year-on-year increase in rents of 3.3% nationally.  However, this national average figure masks differences by property type and location.  Nationally, rents for houses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were 1.6% higher than the same period in 2012, while rents for apartments were 5.2% higher over the same period.  In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.4% and for apartments the figure was 8%.  It is worth noting however that, on average, rents in Dublin are still 15.5% lower than they were at their peak in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p><p>Resolution of the housing supply situation is a key element in restoring stability to the market.  In the meantime, there is scope to explore measures that would protect tenants in the short term from the consequences of market failure.  I have asked the PRTB to carry out focused research on options for addressing the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to me with policy recommendations in that regard before the end of June.  In doing this, I am conscious of the need to avoid introducing measures that would have adverse consequences on the private rented sector.  My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.  The PRTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the sector.  It should be noted that the PRTB replaces the courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes.  For a fee of &euro;25, which is low compared to the cost of initiating full court proceedings, parties to a dispute can apply to the PRTB for adjudication or mediation services rather than go through the courts system.  Demand for the PRTB's services has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting sizable growth in the private rented sector.  The board has responded to these challenges by pursuing a programme of outsourcing, shared services and improved ICT systems.  An online registration system was launched in November 2010, online dispute management services were introduced in 2012 and a programme of shared services has involved electronic tracking of legal documentation and, most recently, the launch in 2013 of a quarterly rent index in association with the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>In addition to these efficiency measures, legislative changes are in train to support of the work of the PRTB.  In November 2012, I introduced the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, streamline and simplify aspects of the Act to assist the board in meeting its service obligations.  The Government recently approved the drafting of amendments to the Bill which include measures to address long-standing issues such as deposit retention and the non-payment of rent in dispute cases, which are the most common dispute types brought before the board, accounting for close to 37% of all dispute types in 2012.  The Bill will also provide for the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the board and will simplify the mediation process</p><p>In regard to security of tenure, an issue I know to be of interest to the Technical Group, the grounds on which a tenancy in the private rented sector may be legally terminated are set out in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  In addition, the Act contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and rent reviews and sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy.  The Act prohibits the setting of a rent that is greater than the market rent for a particular tenancy.  A difficulty arises when there is market failure and there is evidence of this in the form of a lack of supply of suitable properties, mainly in the bigger cities and especially so in Dublin.  In 2006, housing completions in Dublin had risen to 19,470, or approximately 21% of the national total of 93,419.  In 2013, of the 8,301 housing unit built nationally, only 1,360, or just over 16%, were in Dublin.</p><p>Rent supplement is administered as part of the supplementary welfare allowance by the Department of Social Protection.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have access to accommodation from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance rather than to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients, for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. To facilitate a top-up arrangement, the tenant, landlord or landlord's agent must complete the rent supplement application and jointly declare that the information provided is correct and accurate.  The application form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution.  In June 2012, the Department of Social Protection introduced powers of inquiry for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants to further improve the governance arrangements.  In such cases the Department's representative will discuss the circumstances of the case with the tenant before making any decision on ongoing entitlement.  The primary concern in dealing with such cases is to protect the tenant.</p><p>When I spoke earlier of the need to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable in our communities, one of the groups I was referring to was those who are homeless.  In February 2013, the Government's homelessness policy statement was published.  The statement elaborates on commitments made in the programme for Government to review and update the national homeless strategy to end long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by 2016.  I intend to reach that target.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach, which involves accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  As this is a priority matter for Government, the decision was taken to ring-fence funding for homeless services in budgets 2013 and 2014 in support of the discharge by local authorities of their statutory role in the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.</p><p>The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  In the past two years in Dublin, some 1,500 people have moved from homeless services to independent living, with the necessary supports.  When the policy statement was published I also established a homelessness oversight group to review progress, identify obstacles and propose solutions.  The group submitted its first report last December following which, on 25 February 2014, the Government approved the establishment of a homelessness policy implementation team and an implementation unit.</p><p>The team has been asked to implement the recommendations of the oversight group's report.  This includes the preparation and publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response.  This plan will be a practically focused delivery plan and will contain actions that are direct, immediate and solution-based.  I will be going back to Cabinet in coming weeks in order to ensure we have full approval for the various actions that need to take place with regard to that programme.</p><p> The Government, including my Department, is taking steps to address the challenges in the property and construction sectors.  These will include the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing relevant improvements in the planning process and the completion of the review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in the near future, while also seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.  My Department is also committed to delivering a social housing strategy later this year.</p><p> The forthcoming construction sector strategy, which is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach and which other Departments, including my own, are feeding into, builds on recent work on the construction sector, including the publication of a Forf&aacute;s report, a Government statement last July and more recent targeted measures in budget 2014.  The strategy aims to support increased activity and job creation, primarily through the identification and removal of any obstacles that might be acting as a brake on or disincentive to activity.  It is expected to be considered by the Government shortly.</p><p> I thank the Members of the House for listening to my contribution.  I have endeavoured, through my amendment to the motion, to reassure Deputies of the priority the Government accords to the issues of housing and homelessness through the range of actions it is taking to improve the situation for the most vulnerable members of our society.  As I said at the outset, concern in this area is not the preserve of any one side of this House.  As Minister of State, I am working every day to find new ways, better ways and more ways to provide additional housing and to achieve the Government's target of ending long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by 2016, and to improve access to secure and suitable housing for all.</p><p> The role of housing and the housing market in our economic downfall is well documented, and the problems we now face - though of a different nature - reflect the effects of the downturn on our economy.  As we continue to recover, it is critical that housing is accorded its proper place as a critical social and economic asset, providing homes where people can grow and flourish.  Housing is fundamental to our development as a society.  Nobody, least of all I as Minister of State, would say we do not have a long way to go, but let there be no doubt of our commitment to deliver housing and to a programme of meaningful and sustainable reform.  There is no point in pretending that we can magic houses from thin air, but there are ways, with resources, innovation and political will, to deliver those homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="21:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000046#TT00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State's statement.  It is hard to believe that only a few years ago the national conversation was about the oversupply of houses and there was even talk about knocking down housing estates in order to correct the situation.  It is very clear both anecdotally and in media reports that there are people in the big urban centres who have serious problems in accessing housing to have a home for themselves.</p><p>  However, as we embark on planning to meet people's housing needs in all shapes and forms - through the private sector, social housing and so on - we should remember that nearly 2,500 housing units offered by NAMA for social housing were rejected as not being required because obviously those houses were in areas without such a need.  I have some experience of this in County Mayo, where a quarter of houses in new housing estates - more in some estates - are vacant.  It is very clear that the solution there would not be to build new social housing units, even though we have considerable local authority housing waiting lists.  We need some combination of working with the private sector and private rented accommodation to ensure that people's housing needs are met.</p><p>  In regard to the recent changes in rent supplement and rent allowance, the manner in which the changes have been introduced and the capping of rent payable to landlords who are accepting rent supplement are arbitrary and unrealistic in some cases.  It is leading to unnecessary hardship for people who have no alternative.</p><p>  Some people who are in mortgage distress would like to pursue the solution of a voluntary housing association taking over their house so that they can rent it back.  In this way they would not lose their homes.  I understand there are major difficulties in proceeding along this line.  We need to ensure the scheme set up by Government is operating as we would like to see it operate, and any issues there should be addressed.</p><p>  I wish to raise one issue on the housing policy side with the Minister of State, which is the assessment of housing need.  I refer in particular to separated persons.  Of late people seem to be put under extraordinary pressure to come up with a formal legal separation or divorce.  In some cases people never go down that route, but it is never in dispute that the parties are living apart, and the wife with children may be left in the family home.  They may never have engaged a solicitor for many reasons.  Under the law, at every step people may reconcile.  I am not saying that is realistic in many situations.  It seems strange that both the housing authority and the Department of Social Protection are pressing these people to make legal something that they may choose not to.  The important point is that these people have a housing need and if they have sufficient evidence we should not be sending them to solicitors to formalise their legal separations in order to tick a box confirming that they have a housing need if it can be established otherwise.</p><p>  I welcome the &euro;50 million the Minister of State has allocated to addressing the problem of long-term voids in the local authority housing stock.  However, there is a problem in the way planned maintenance is proceeding, particularly regarding the heating systems that are being installed.  In recent years, when an older heating system such as a solid-fuel heating system with a back boiler is being replaced, oil-fired central heating is being installed instead.  In these times, when everything seems to be geared to reducing our carbon emissions and we are levying a carbon tax on people, it is extraordinary that we cannot be more imaginative when we are upgrading heating systems for these tenants and give them a system that will last for years, given that in many cases they cannot afford to pay for the oil.  That needs to be seriously addressed, as Government funds are being put into this.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Halligan that I take the problem of homelessness and housing very seriously.  I have spoken a number of times, including in the past month, on similar issues.  Nobody is denying that there is a crisis with housing and homelessness.  All Members in the House and our colleagues in the local authorities are dealing with large numbers of housing-related queries.  I sit on the Labour Party sub-committee on housing, and we have drafted a report for the Minister of State listing the areas in housing in which we want to see change.  I understand that the Minister of State finds herself in a very difficult situation, although she has been very active in responding to the contents of that report.  Even if we had the money, it would possibly take two or three years before people would find themselves in a home.</p><p>  I will not go on about the legacy issues we were left with.</p><p>A major flaw in the housing policy of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was that the local authority had to raise funds by the number of planning permissions it granted.  That was a fundamental flaw because the regulatory authority had to give planning permissions to get a funding stream to deliver houses.  It was a kind of stick approach to local authorities in that the more planning permissions they granted, the more money they got in, which was very wrong.  When I was on Kilkenny County Council, any time we tried to draw attention to housing issues such as this and said permission had been granted for 300 houses in the back of beyond where there was no chemist, no shop and no school, we were always told we were anti-development by our Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  The Labour Party members on the county councils were always told they were anti-development.  If we had been able to fight harder on those councils for what we believed in, we would not be in this situation but nobody wanted to listen to us.  Now everybody is talking about the housing crisis.  We inherited this housing crisis.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State on what she is doing and for being on top of her brief.  I very much welcome today's approval by Cabinet of the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  The three main elements of the Government's housing policy will bring clarity and purpose to how we deal with the serious problems in this area, as outlined by the Minister of State, introduce a new tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants, provide a legislative basis for the new housing assistance payment, HAP, and reform the process for the termination of local authority tenancies.</p><p>I would like to draw attention to a point Deputy Wallace raised, which I have raised with the Minister of State a number of times, namely, the need for the Government to get seriously involved in the rental sector and to try to bring about stability in that sector.  One sees a house on <i>daft.ie</i>priced at &euro;850 per month but stating that no rent allowance tenants need apply.  That is dreadful and we need to do something about it.  Governments in France, Italy, Austria and on the Continent take a very heavy-handed approach to the rental sector and it is possibly the way we have to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-30a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1040" speakername="Michael Kitt" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014043000047#UU00200"><p>I support the motion proposed by the Technical Group and I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for the proposal she put to the House.  We all know there is a need for radical action to tackle the housing crisis, in particular in Dublin, but as other speakers said there is also a need for more housing in the large urban centres throughout the country.  The big issue is how we deal with this.</p><p>There were some harrowing stories over the past week on the plight of homeless families.  The two stories about which I read and about which there has been much publicity were that of a mother and her five children who have spent the past three months in a hotel room in west Dublin and of a mother and her three children who have lived and slept in a car.  In an editorial last Saturday, <i>The Irish Times</i>asked how this could happen in 2014.  It stated that in one of the situations, home was a hotel room used to accommodate a young family of six while in the other situation, home was a car, the last resort of a family of four.  Both stories suggest a new dimension to homelessness in that we are not talking about individuals but about families and, increasingly, children feature in homelessness.</p><p>I am informed that in Dublin, more than 170 families, including 500 children, have been allocated temporary hotel accommodation by the local authorities and have to join the queue for social housing.  That is why I particularly like the reference in the motion to situations involving children and offering emergency accommodation within a reasonable distance from the children's schools.  It is appalling that children would have to be taken out of a school because their accommodation is a distance from where they are staying.</p><p>The right to a home for every citizen is vital, as is permanent, secure and affordable housing.  I hope we can support a strong social and private housing sector.  However, I believe Ireland is falling behind in the way we provide units of housing - I prefer to call them &quot;homes&quot; - for families.  We must address how we can make more homes available.  The transfer of NAMA units is always mentioned as being very important.  Developing housing associations is important, as is generally encouraging housing development.</p><p>We are aware that the construction industry has suffered a shocking level of decline, collapsing to just about 6.5% of GNP, which is well below the international average.  The dramatic deficit in private sector housing is mirrored by the spiralling waiting list in social housing.  We are told that more than 90,000 householders are on the social housing waiting list.  We talk about transferring NAMA units into housing but only 10% of homes earmarked by NAMA for social housing have been transferred to local authorities.  I hope we can take steps to tackle the private and the social housing situations.</p><p>Reference was made to the voluntary housing associations.  I would like to see them accessing credit and starting to build and tenants being able to purchases houses, where appropriate, which they cannot do currently.  I mentioned the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Ballinasloe to the Minister of State previously, and I do so again.  It might be unusual for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to be involved in housing but, as the Minister of State knows, there is a trust in Galway city and in rural Galway which means there is funding available for the society to provide housing.  In the case of Ballinasloe, it is through Cl&uacute;id, the housing agency.  Cl&uacute;id is the Irish word for &quot;cover&quot; or &quot;shelter&quot;.  Indeed, it is particularly expert in providing sheltered housing.  The proposals under the capital assistance programme should be looked at and there is certainly one from Ballinasloe.</p><p>There are specialist units in every local authority to deal with disabled persons' housing, disabled persons' grants and tenant purchases.  I would like to see the same type of units for NAMA.  My information is that NAMA identified 4,500 residential properties as potentially suitable for social housing and so far 518 have been delivered.  The figures are very stark.  In the first three quarters of last year, a mere 253 social housing units were built compared to 5,000 in 2007.  Obviously, there is a need to find a way to provide more housing.  </p><p>The Minister of State talked about the mortgage-to-rent scheme, which we have raised in the House.  There certainly have been stumbling blocks along the way and Cl&uacute;id has talked about the banking sector as being a very serious stumbling block.</p><p>It has talked about 566 cases being referred to it and the banks withdrawing 240 cases.  It is disappointing that is happening.  The economist, Alan Ahearne, talked about central banks around the world driving interest rates and bond yields to low levels, but he said that in this country those policies have not resulted in lower interest rates on new mortgages.  In fact, he said that banks have increased borrowed costs on new loans in part to cross-subsidise loss-making tracker mortgages.  There is a boost for the housing market when people shift some of their savings into housing or when they get worried about DIRT tax or pension levies.  According to Alan Ahearne, that partially explains the influx of the cash-rich buyers who have come into the market.  In essence, he is saying that we should look at having more homes in the right places.</p><p> Dublin has been highlighted but in the suburbs of Cork and Galway there are increasing worries about homelessness.  In Galway, for example, the HSE has 123 extra people on the homeless list.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has also expressed concern that almost 4,000 people with disabilities were in need of social housing last year.  I hope we can make progress and work on the basis of the motion before the House.</p></speech>

I wish to offer some insight into what is happening in Cork City Council, for example, and to share some ideas that might assist to address the issues.  I do not expect the Government to be able to resolve every issue that presents.  I understand the constraints under which the Government operates.  However, we might be able to address some of the problems with some clever initiatives.</p><p>  Approximately 500 units in Cork are vacant at any one time.  Many of them are boarded up or shuttered.  In effect, when a house is given back to the city council due to a transfer or is taken in charge for whatever reason, an inspection is carried out and more than likely the house is left vacant for a while before being boarded up at a later stage.  Units can be vacant for as long as two or three years.  I was in Mary Aikenhead Place on the north side of Cork city recently where 11 of the finest apartments are vacant, some of them for nearly three years.  That is the situation in one small community while at the same time more than 8,000 people are on the housing list.  I do not point the finger at Cork City Council or the Government but this is the practical reality on the ground.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is aware of the situation in her constituency.  It is difficult to reconcile having 8,000 people waiting for housing and at the same time there being 500 houses vacant and decaying.</p><p>  When the city council gets around to allocating a house, it must first rip out the contents and put in new furnishings.  When a house becomes vacant, it could be presented to a family who would be willing to work on the house themselves or get a recognised contractor to do the work.  One could reward such effort and initiative by transferring part ownership to the tenant.  That would take the problem off the city council's hands.  This is not a political point; it is an observation.  Families are under huge pressure and stress on waiting lists, some of them for eight years or nine years, and it is difficult to reconcile the idea of vacant houses throughout Cork city.  The population of Cork city and county is about one tenth of the overall population &ndash; it has a better percentage in hurling All-Irelands - but in general if it is happening in Cork, it is happening elsewhere throughout the country.  We have potentially in excess of 5,000 boarded-up units across the State.  Thousands of families could be granted such houses by local authorities and enter into a formal arrangement to allow for a transfer of ownership over a period to reward the tenants who get the house for their investment in it.  They could start paying a partial rent or undertake a capital purchase over a period.</p><p>  The Government will not resolve the problem of the number of vacant houses in the coming years with its current resources and on the basis of the allocation to Cork City Council.  The number of vacant houses will not be significantly reduced.  Currently, Cork City Council is responsible for approximately 50 completions a year.  There are approximately 500 vacant units and approximately 180 allocations, on average 15 a month.  With the best will in the world, given the capital grants made available to Cork City Council for completions, progress will not be made and we will go backwards.  That is an observation as opposed to a political point.  It is a fact.  We must be imaginative in our response.</p><p>  People ask why the public is disconnected from politics and why they say politicians are all the one.  They ask why we cannot do the practical things right and make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  The proposal I outlined would be one simple way to do that.  It is difficult to reconcile the idea that a house is taken in charge by the city council, that it inspects it, waits until a few stones are thrown through a window or a couple of gurriers climb in the back window and strip it and then the council puts up shutters, leaves the property for two years while waiting for a grant to come through to refurbish the house that was in perfect condition the day it was vacated, in order to give it to a family that needed the house two years previously and would have been willing to go into it and refurbish it on a partial basis or as they went along.</p><p>  I visited some of the houses to which I refer.  They are in perfect condition when they are handed over.  The furnishings are of good quality and the bathrooms and kitchens are in good order.  All that is required is new carpets and paint and for the electrics to be checked.  That should not take two and a half years.  The Minister of State should consider the notion of a partial transfer of ownership.  The tenants could make a partial purchase and pay the remainder in rent.  A scheme could be worked out.  The Minister of State should consider such an approach to address vacant properties.</p><p>  When one gives a person a sense of ownership, he or she responds in kind because it is in one&rsquo;s interest to respond in such a way.  It is in the interests of a person to invest in a property if it is his or her home for a long period.  That is a way to address a problem local authorities cannot address currently.  If Cork City Council is doing 50 completions in a year and there are 500 vacant properties, it will never fully address the problem.  We are faced with people continually coming to constituency offices saying their son, daughter or family are waiting for a house for up to seven years while at the same time there is a house next door to their mother, family home or community that has been idle for two years and is now trashed and boarded up.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the issue for many reasons because it would allow people to move into homes immediately which would benefit communities and assist local authorities, given that with the current capital allocation and resources and a cap on recruitment of staff, they will never be able to resolve the situation in the short to medium term.  In the meantime, such units as I described at Mary Aikenhead Place and elsewhere throughout Cork city will lie vacant, vandalised, in decay and diminish communities.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the issue as a matter of urgency as it might assist individuals and communities.</p></speech>

The story was that the young woman concerned and her family had slept in a car.  There was much media interest in the case.  On the same day a different family from Tallaght visited me.  The young woman was five months pregnant and she had a three year old child, and she and her partner had slept in a car the previous night.</p><p>The story that ran in the newspapers is not unusual.</p><p> Last night, I had a telephone call from a niece of mine in Clondalkin about a young woman and her family who were being put out of their home by the landlord and who was presenting today to South Dublin County Council, SDCC.  Last Friday, when I tried to get accommodation for the woman who is pregnant, the council said it had no emergency accommodation.  I was given the telephone number for the Dublin City Council area and when I tried to call, there were 25 people in the queue before me.  Eventually, I got through and I was told there was a difficulty.  The council did not have anything and the staff were annoyed that I had been referred by SDCC to their office.  I could feel the tension down the line as they tried to deal with the problem.  Their solution was to split the family up but they had no accommodation for the young child.  Currently, a number of families live in hotel accommodation in the SDCC area.  Each family shares one room but they do not have facilities, particularly for children.  They have no facility to clean or wash clothes, etc.  These means added expense for them.  Those that are on social welfare payments also face a difficulty that must be sorted out with the local authority.</p><p> The woman to whom I spoke earlier who has presented as homeless had been taken in by a neighbour because no accommodation was available.  However, at 5 p.m., she received a telephone call to say bed and breakfast accommodation was available in town.  I am relating these stories because a huge number of families are experiencing these conditions.  Two families a week present at my office in circumstances such as this.  Landlords are saying they want to increase the rents because the rent supplement is no longer sufficient and eventually families are put out of their homes.  The difficulty is, as I pointed out to the Minister of State during a debate a few weeks ago, that no accommodation is available to rent in Dublin South West.  Other Members can probably outline a similar story in their constituencies.  There is what I would describe as a crisis, although the Minister might describe it as something else.  However, all of us will agree there is a problem that needs to be fixed.</p><p> Six months ago, many of the local authorities were coping with the housing problem, the provision of emergency accommodation and so on but they are not coping now and they cannot manage the number of people presenting.  This will get worse, not better, and no emergency measures or new approaches are being taken to deal with the problem, which is my biggest worry.  There is a general consensus that this is a crisis and we would like alternatives to emerge from this debate.  I refer to the proposal related to the turnover of housing stock.  While houses are boarded up in my constituency, I do not know if the proposal put forward by Deputy Kelleher is fair, particularly for families who do not have the resources to go down this road or who do not have the skills to do up those houses.  That would discriminate against many people.  Let us hear ideas in this debate and I ask the Minister to come back to the House with radical new proposals.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put suggestions forward.  They are ways to fix this problem and get us out of this mess.</p></speech>
