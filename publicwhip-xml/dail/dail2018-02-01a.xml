    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00500"><p>I apologise for being slightly late.  I had to query a matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, to whom I am grateful.  His office is full of useful information.</p>  <p>  I tabled my question to the Minister for Education and Skills in accordance with normal procedures.  Is he satisfied that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes?  My constituency is in the cockpit of the changes.  It is experiencing a huge increase in population which will start to filter into west Dublin, south east Meath, north Kildare, Fingal and other parts of the country.  From my experience, I am not convinced that the Department is up to speed and I want to know what in general the Minister is doing about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00600"><p>It is a valid question for the Deputy to raise.  Ireland has experienced a significant bulge in pupil enrolments in schools.  We have seen significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places, which puts a high demand on the Department's capital budgets.  Since 2011 there have been 340 major school projects and over 120,000 new and replacement places have been provided.</p>  <p>  My Department's capital programme continues to address the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing school population.  To meet this demographic challenge, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme for the period 2016 to 2021 details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process.  The programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  We are building more schools and providing more school places than ever before.  This reflects the priority which the Government is giving to education.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  It uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where there will be pressure to provide school places across the country.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources. </p>  <p>  The nationwide demographic exercises involving all school planning areas at primary and post-primary level which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future are ongoing.  My Department is factoring in the demographic exercises critical updated data, including updated enrolment data and up-to-date information on additional residential development from local authorities.  The provisional 2017-18 enrolment data have recently been made available and provide an important update on the available information which will inform the outcome of the demographic exercises.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the review will be announced in the coming weeks.  In addition, my Department is included in the prescribed bodies to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00700"><p>I am glad that a review is taking place.  I have raised this issue previously in the D&aacute;il.  I have met officials at my request, meetings the Minister organised, to explain my concerns.  What is happening in my constituency in Dunshaughlin and Ashbourne, in particular - I suspect it is also happening in other constituencies - is that houses are being built that are not starter homes.  They are not for families starting off, rather they are for ready-made families, as a predecessor of mine on the education side in my party described them.  They are for families with grown up children who are moving to Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin, in particular.  In all my years as a Deputy, until the past few years, I never had to deal with an educational welfare officer to find a school place for a child.  Unfortunately, this is now a regular feature of my constituency work in Ashbourne, in particular.  It is not fair.  Families who have moved into the area find that there is not a single school place available if they have a child attending first, third or fifth class, despite welcome improvements in schools infrastructure delivery.  I am told by my colleagues in Fingal and Kildare that, notwithstanding further developments, the Department is already behind in providing new designated buildings.  I am very concerned about this issue.  We should not have to ring an educational welfare officer to find a school place for a child.  That is the last thing we should need to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00900"><p>I accept the Deputy's point that patterns of development are changing and that, as a result, the models used to predict growth in the numbers of children in accordance with new settlements have to factor this in.  We liaise very closely with the local authorities which have on-the-ground information.  We also track child benefit payments data and pick up data for preschool children as quickly as possible.  We use every data source we can track, be it social welfare, local authority or another source.  I can give the Deputy information on them.  It is a forecasting exercise which is always prone to error, but the Department is using all of the geographical based information data on which the Central Statistics Office and others can lay their hands to improve the forecasting model.  As I said, if there are particular needs, there are systems in place to provide additional school places on a quicker basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A01000"><p>The educational welfare service of Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs urgently needs to be brought within the Minister's Department.  Educational welfare officers are finding issues on the ground; they are definitely finding them in Ashbourne, as they will tell the Minister.  They are receiving representations from my clinic and I am sure from those of the Minister's colleagues.  The service should be within the Minister's Department in order that it would know first-hand from the individuals in question where the critical points were and why a first class or a third class in a school was full.  In general, there may not yet be a problem in finding places in junior infant classes in some cases.  As I said, the houses being built are four-bedroom detached dwellings in many cases.  This presents a real problem.  The Department has a long history in that regard and knows all about this problem.  It had to deal with a crisis in Laytown, which was the first political issue on which I worked just before I was elected to the D&aacute;il with the late Deputy Shane McEntee.  The issues that arose there appear to be beginning to arise again elsewhere and I am disappointed that the Department does not seem to have learned the lessons.  That crisis is seared in my memory and I will certainly do all in my power to prevent such an issue from ever arising again.</p></speech>

Most of them were in areas where we had identified a need.  Of course, the Department has to have a planning process and we rely on the local authorities and other agencies to supply us with data.  The data we use come from the CSO, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Tusla, as well as our own enrolments databases.  I will ensure the Department factors in any information coming from agencies such as Tusla that may not be available in the forecasting model.</p></speech>

This uses information that we can track from any sources that can help refine the process.</p></speech>

These units are not available within a reasonable geographic distance for students.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00500"><p>Ensuring that children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for this Government.  Since 2011 we have provided 12,000 extra pupils with special needs assistant, SNA, support.  The investment has been very substantial.  There have been 3,545 additional SNAs since 2011, over 2,000 in the last two years.  There have been 3,660 additional resource teachers, 1,600 of which have been recruited in the past two years.  In terms of special classes, which I know the Deputy is concerned about, there have been an additional 712 of those since 2011.  That represents a more than doubling of the amount of special class, including 277 new classes in the past two years.  Another 180 are planned for this September.</p>  <p>  The Department is extending major investment to meet the very needs the Deputy brings up, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, advises me that we are meeting those needs.</p>  <p>  Most children with special education needs attend mainstream class, but some require the environment of a special class. This decision is based on a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, SENOs, in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area, for example where a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, Deputy Thomas Byrne and others have urged at Committee Stage that we would introduce a provision, which I am now having drafted, which would give the NCSE the power to designate a school to open a special class, should that prove necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00600"><p>I am concerned that the NCSE is saying it is meeting the requirements.  Unfortunately it is not.  I am not sure where it is getting its figures from, but in my constituency alone in the last number of months I have dealt with three cases of children who are due to start school in September and who have no school place.  Starting school is a major step in anybody's life, but if a person has an additional need and does not know what school he or she will attend it is difficult.  In some situations parents are being told that there is a school an hour or an hour and a half away and that transport will be provided.  In that instance a child of five is being asked to get on a bus for an hour and a half before he or she even starts school.  A few weeks into that sort of system they are going to be so exhausted that they will not be able to learn, let alone reach their full potential.  There are 24 ASD units throughout Carlow and Kilkenny at primary level and 16 at post primary level.  They only cater for six children each, so that is a total of 144 in primary school and 96 at post-primary.  It is not adequate, certainly in my constituency.  Perhaps the NCSE is saying that it is adequate in its eyes, but I invite it to come down to our constituency and visit the schools and parents who are struggling.  What are we supposed to tell them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00700"><p>We are establishing these special units at a very rapid pace.  There are 180 planned for next September.  To have a special class the NCSE must ensure that there are enough children so that it will be a sustainable class.  It has to consider present and future need.  While it will not always be possible to provide an ASD unit in the child's own school for that reason the NCSE has informed the Department that it is generally satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class places at primary level to meet existing demand.  The NCSE and my Department work closely together to address the issues of provision that arise from time to time at local level.  These issues arise in my constituency as well.</p>  <p>  Children with special education needs are eligible for school transport.  In the event that these children have to move away from their local school their transport requirements will be met.  That has been significantly expanded, so that 2,000 more children with special needs have availed of school transport in the last number of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00800"><p>I understand that the children are eligible for school transport, but it is not good enough that we are asking a five year old child to get on a bus at 7.30 a.m. so that he or she can be in school for 9 a.m.  The child in that instance would be awake for over an hour and a half before they even get to school and begin to learn.  That is not an adequate way to learn.  That child is not going to do well.  He or she is going to end up completely exhausted and will miss days from school.  I would ask that the Minister inquire of the NCSE, if it is insisting that there are adequate spaces, whether it will look into provision in Carlow-Kilkenny and tell us why there are so many children who are unable to get a place in an ASD unit.  In some cases a place is not available even an hour or an hour and a half away.  There have been a large number of cases in the last few months where parents have been told that schools just do not have the space in September.  It is now February, and parents do not know where their children will be going to school in September.  That is completely unfair.  Every other child who does not have an additional need who is starting school will know either this month or next month when they will start school.  There will be the usual meetings with the school concerning being a new student and the whole big step of starting school.  These other children are simply being left behind because they have an additional need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00900"><p>It is important to say that two thirds of children with special needs are accommodated in a mainstream class.  Not every child needs to be considered for a special unit.  A special unit is a six-child unit, with a teacher of its own and two SNAs.  Its own space has to be developed.  Unfortunately we cannot guarantee that will be available in every single local school.  Where the need is established in an area we work with the schools to establish that class as conveniently as possible to the children who have the need.  That requires school transport for some children in some cases.  The NCSE tries to solve these problems in as practical a way as possible by working with the schools.  We are taking this additional step of giving the power to direct, if necessary, to the NCSE.  By and large we have not found that schools are unsupportive of these units.  In fact, many schools are really keen to see the development of those units in their areas.</p>  <p>  It is expanding very rapidly.  We are matching the need, as conveniently as we can, to the parents.  I will ask that the NCSE have a look at Carlow-Kilkenny.</p></speech>

There is a real technological divide between schools happening at the moment.  In many cases it is an urban-rural divide, and in some cases it is putting the future of rural schools at risk because they do not have access to broadband.  Ludicrous situations are arising, as is also the case for many rural dwellers, where the mainline Eir broadband is coming within a few feet or metres of particular schools.  Sometimes the Eir broadband is just up the road but it cannot be provided to the schools.  What does the Minister propose to do about this?</p></reply>

Deputy Byrne has outlined why that is important.  It is essential to embed technologies for teaching and learning and for the implementation of new subjects.  My Department spends some &euro;15 million per year on the provision of internet connectivity.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided.</p>  <p>  A programme to roll out broadband to post-primary schools was started in 2012, at a time when virtually no school had speeds of over 30Mbp/s.  By the end of 2015, all 735 post-primary schools and some 58 special schools had speeds of 100Mbp/s.</p>  <p>  In the case of primary schools, by the end of 2017, 1,046 schools were upgraded to speeds of 30Mbp/s plus, the standard established under the national broadband plan.  It is anticipated that the infrastructure to be made available through Eir's 300K rural deployment commitment will reach 700 to 800 schools by the end of 2018. </p><p>This infrastructure will allow for speeds of at least 30 Mbps, if not more, and my Department will upgrade the service to those schools as soon as possible on delivery of the infrastructure.</p> <p> The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in my Department's digital strategy.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to advise on how this can be best achieved while having regard to other developments in State policy and the implementation of the Government's national broadband plan, its associated intervention strategy and provision offered by the industry.  Extensive training supports are available to schools to help in their planning and engagement with technology for teaching and learning.</p></speech>

Eir has a strategy for its own rural network and, before yesterday, apparently had a strategy for the rest of the rural network.  I posted on Facebook yesterday, for my constituents, that Eir had pulled out of the national broadband plan.  I view that as a disaster, as I am sure everybody does, but the reaction from members of the public was a little different.  They have had such bad experiences with Eir, in various guises, over recent years that they are somewhat glad it is out of the process because they do not have confidence in it.  When the Minister says that Eir will deliver these schools by the end of the year, it is almost passing the buck to a company that, let us be honest, has shown itself to be unreliable in the provision of broadband in rural areas.  Yesterday was the pinnacle of that.  I am very concerned that the answer to schools' broadband provision is Eir.  The Department needs a far more comprehensive strategy involving the Department and other technologies that might be available.  The Department should consider that urgently.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the elements of putting this in place will partly come from commercial roll-out and Eir and others are doing that.  It will partly come from the national broadband plan as well, and there are others that will have to be resolved in other ways.  We are working in all three channels, as it were.  We cannot ignore that where it is commercially viable for a company to roll it out, and Eir is a significant player and its plan envisages another 700 to 800 this year, that is clearly an opportunity for us to deliver to our primary schools.  However, it is not the sole way of resolving the remaining areas we must address.  Each year my Department seeks to plan the continuing roll-out.  I share the Deputy's concern that we do this as quickly as possible.  I understand the national broadband plan has the target of 2022 to complete the roll-out.  If that could be achieved it would be the real backbone for addressing the rural disadvantage about which the Deputy is concerned.</p></speech>

That is the truth.  Parents will look askance at schools that cannot provide the full educational experience to their students.  As I said previously, the centre point of the strategy appears to be Eir.  Eir is a dead duck.  If it rolls out what it says it will in rural areas, aside from the national broadband plan which it has dropped like a hot potato, it may work out, but it is not acceptable for the Department of Education and Skills to put its eggs in the basket of a private operator that has proved itself to be unreliable in the provision of broadband, and not just in rural areas.  I am seeking a much more comprehensive strategy.  After the debacle that occurred yesterday, which is tragic for broadband in rural areas, perhaps it is time for the Department to acknowledge that it must look at this again, as it is a clear and present threat to our rural schools.</p></speech>

However, Eir has a plan and it reiterated yesterday that it would deliver that plan even though it is pulling back from the national broadband plan.  It would be short-sighted of the Department to suggest that Eir's potential to fill a significant gap should be shunned in some way.  We will work with any commercial provider that proves capable of delivering.  I am keen to have this move as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who will probably be answering questions later in the House, does not foresee delay in the roll-out of the national broadband strategy as a result of the decision by Eir, so we will continue to work with all parties and use the best available information to support our programme of investment.</p></speech>

The grant most recently issued to all primary schools last December in respect of the school year 2017-18.  The payment of the minor works grant is not confined to any particular date and can be issued during any month of the school year.  For the 2002-03 school year, part of the grant was paid in May 2003 with the balance paid in October 2003.</p>  <p>  With regard to the minor works grant for 2018-19, it is intended that the grant will issue not later than January 2019.  The capital allocation for the school sector in 2018 will be expended primarily on large-scale projects, the additional accommodation scheme and site acquisitions.  The priority remains to have sufficient school places available for the start of the school year next September.</p>  <p>  I am confident that outlining the position regarding the minor works grant for 2018-19 gives certainty to schools so they can plan accordingly for the infrastructure works specified in the minor works grant circular that they intend to undertake.  My Department recognises the importance of the minor works grant and there are no plans in place either to withdraw or reduce it.  As part of our longer-term infrastructural planning, the Department will explore whether it will be possible to give greater certainty to primary schools about the payment of the minor works grant, taking account of the Government's ten-year public capital investment plan which is under development.</p></reply>

I agree with the Minister that the scheme is necessary.  However, it is not just for minor works now.  It is for physically trying to keep the schools standing with some modicum of respectability for the staff and the pupils.  They are being educated in buildings that are creaking and damp and often have many other problems such as with the roof or the heating.  There were issues with heating in some schools recently that the minor works grant would not even cover.  The grant is really a sticking plaster for many schools.  However, I accept the Minister's statement that the grants for this year will be paid not later than January 2019.  My main worry is if there is enough funding available and whether there will be cutbacks to the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that because it is vital.  As I said, the scheme is a sticking plaster but it is vital for principals, boards of management and parent councils to have that avenue to get some funding.  They must fundraise for a huge amount of the rest.</p></speech>

I believe what we have worked out here is a satisfactory arrangement.  We recognise that 2018 will be a difficult year because there are so many demands on the scheme.  We made the payment before the end of last year and we have given schools advance notice that the next payment will be in January 2019.  That allows us to manage our flow of money and it gives schools certainty.  As the Deputy said, this has become an expectation and a need for schools, so over the coming years I will seek to give a map upon which people can plan.</p></speech>

Now he says he will pay it by January 2019.  However, is there sufficient funding to meet the demand that will arise?  The Minister was unsure in the House some months ago.  He said it himself.  It was not another Minister answering for him.  I believe what the Minister says himself.</p><p>The concern is that people are going to put in applications.  The Minister said they would be paid by January 2019, which is good, but will they all get over the wire?  These schools are looking for a very necessary few bob to ease the pressure on the parents, the boards of management and the parents councils' fundraising efforts in order to keep the schools open - literally to keep the lights on, fix collapsed ceilings and deal with dampness, accidental damage or, God forbid, storm damage.  This grant is all they have.  The minor works scheme is paltry enough so I need to know, on behalf of the schools in Tipperary, that there will be enough in the scheme if they apply.</p></speech>

This is something we pay on the basis of capitation, and it is so much per child and so much per school according to a formula.  What I am saying very clearly is that we paid it before Christmas and we will pay it again on the same basis in January 2019.  We will be paying it for each school year and we will continue to pay it.  There are not pressures on the resources and we are making provision for that payment.  We can map this.  As the Deputy said, it has become an area where schools need money, so we will map that into the future in line with other longer-term planning.</p></speech>

I am pleased that, under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I negotiated a programme of pay restoration with the teacher unions.  Through this process, a 15% to 22% pay increase was negotiated for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for newer teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and, from 1 October 2020, will be &euro;37,692.  This is a very competitive graduate salary, as the CSO reports today have confirmed.</p>  <p>  I have successfully hired over 5,000 extra teachers in the last two years.  We are hiring more teachers than at any other point in the State's history.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross-sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The public service stability agreement 2018-20 contains a commitment to consider the issue of newly qualified teacher pay within 12 months of the agreement&rsquo;s commencement and that process has started.  Also, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will lay a report before the Oireachtas on the cost of, and a plan for dealing with, pay equalisation for new entrants within three months of the passing of the Act.</p>  <p>  On the issue of teacher supply, the Deputy may wish to note that I have already announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short-term vacancies.</p></speech>

That means the number of applicants is now substantially less than half of what it was five years ago - in fact, there has been a collapse of 62% over that period.  It is clear that a career as a teacher no longer has the attraction it had even five years ago.  Clearly, the combination of salary scale, conditions of service and career prospects are deficient.  This is exacerbated by the travesty of paying new entrants at a lower salary scale and providing a pension scheme which is significantly inferior to that enjoyed by their longer-serving colleagues.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister, as a first step, equalise the pay scales of new entrants with their colleagues?  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, which represents 2,800 schools, found that 90% of principals are having difficulties finding qualified or substitute teachers.</p></speech>

However, the number graduating from the programme has not.  By contrast, the undergraduate programme is massively oversubscribed.  There are more than 5,000 seeking to join the undergraduate programme, for which there are only 500 places, and I announced last week that I plan to double the number of places on that undergraduate programme.  Of course, that has the advantage in financial terms that a master's fee does not have to be paid for people going that route.  I have also announced that I plan to have quotas for particular subject areas where, as Deputies have pointed out, there is tightness and we need to have ambition, for example, the STEM programme and the foreign languages programme.  I am establishing a teachers supply steering group which will work with all of the stakeholders to deliver these programmes.  I made immediate changes in terms of the career break and the period that people could work on a career break.  I have advised schools that they should not give a career break unless they can, as the circular requires, be assured it is in the best interests of children in the school and that they can fill the position vacated.</p></speech>

The ETBs, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the joint managerial bodies, the trade unions and everybody else have acknowledged there is a significant crisis in recruitment and retention of teachers and it is getting worse.  The suggestion that restricting career breaks would help is not correct and would, in fact, worsen the situation and mean we have teachers emigrating.</p>  <p>  We must continue to have the most able people teaching our children.  The continuation of current Government policy will do lasting damage to the education system.  Bad and all as the situation is now, official documents and official statistics show that, at second level alone, there will be an additional 85,000 students by 2025, which will require an additional 4,000 teachers.</p></speech>

There is the issue of substitution and the issue of subject areas, which I am addressing, and I am also planning to double the number of undergraduate places for teaching.  Those are very solid responses to needs that we all acknowledge.  It is worth pointing out to the Deputy that, back in 2014, before I made the improvements in pay that we negotiated with the unions, teachers were the second-highest paid graduates, second only to ICT workers.</p><p>We have made improvements since then and we have a process in place under the pay negotiations where the remaining issues of the trade unions are being discussed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his advisers with a view to resolving those issues over time.  There is a process in place which the Deputy should acknowledge.  We are making real efforts to establish a balanced response to the needs of teachers which are, of course, important, as well as the needs of pupils.  We have heard about the many challenges we must meet in regard to pupils who we must also treat equitably.</p></speech>

Current enrolment stands at 202 pupils with a current staffing of one principal plus eight mainstream teaching posts and three special education support teachers.  The site for the school is quite restricted and is bounded by Dominick Street Lower to the front, Dominick Place to the rear and No. 20 Dominick Street to the north which is a protected structure.</p>  <p>  The original design brief for this project was for an eight-classroom primary school and a team to design this project was appointed by open competition in December 2012.  However, due to increasing enrolments, the brief increased to a 16-classroom school.  The project has been designed up to stage 2A - developed design - as an eight-classroom primary school by this design team with a design indication option of how a 16-classroom school could be fitted into this restrictive site.  In April of last year, the services of this design team were terminated by mutual agreement and it became necessary to commence the tender process to appoint a new design team to complete fully a stage 2A, developed-design report for the 16-classroom school.  This process is nearing completion, letters of intent have issued to each of the disciplines and once final documentation checks are completed in full, my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities to advise them as to the next steps in the process.  The progression of this project through architectural planning and into construction will be dealt with as part of my Department's schools building programme 2016 to 2021.</p></speech>

The Minister set out those details then.  I acknowledge the work the school and the Department have done.  The patron, trustees, board of management, parents' council and teachers have done a great deal of extra work to progress the project since the decision was taken to double the size of the school.  As to the design, will there be enough open space for the children given the restricted site?  Are we clear on that given the importance of an open playing space for children?  Can the Minister provide a realistic timeframe going forward?  That is what I really want to get today.  The school has been in temporary accommodation for 14 years.  Does the Minister have any idea of when the tendering process will be completed and the next stage will commence?</p></speech>

It is not possible for me to forecast when various stages will complete.  As the Deputy said, this started as a plan for an eight-teacher school, but that changed.  Changes of that nature are beyond my capacity to predict and it would be very hazardous for me to suggest a completion date.  The Department will work with the school and the design team.  As to the open space, I have no information.  I presume the design team has worked with the school to ensure its needs are met, but I do not have information on the detailed brief that has been drawn up.</p></speech>

The Department provides a grant towards that temporary accommodation for the school every year and one must think about what that money could be used to achieve if the school moved to a permanent site.  I ask the Minister to ensure this stays on the agenda and for real progress for teachers and pupils in 2018.  As it stands, they are in unsuitable accommodation which is unfair to the staff and the children and is costing the Department money.</p></speech>

It is, of course, necessary to use temporary accommodation at times.  In an ideal world we would not be doing it, but schools grow at different paces and one has to be flexible.  Temporary accommodation is a necessary way to deliver a consistent programme over time, but I take the Deputy's point and hopefully we can make good progress on the project.</p></speech>

In accordance with the memorandum of understanding, my Department continues to work with officials in Fingal County Council to identify and acquire school sites and this process is ongoing.  A new site has recently been procured in Mooretown, Swords, and a building project is planned which will provide permanent accommodation for Swords Community College in due course.  I am not in a position to provide further details at this time in respect of the schools in Malahide-Portmarnock due to the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the provision of sites for schools is a priority for the Department.  My Department is in communication with the respective patron bodies in respect of interim accommodation arrangements pending delivery of permanent accommodation.</p></speech>

While that might not seem too far if one is outside Dublin, it is a very significant distance in an urban environment, in particular given traffic on the Malahide Road.  It is also accommodated in an unsuitable facility which is in effect a former third-level agricultural college.  We are expending considerable moneys to facilitate the school there.  The difficulty is that there is considerable demand for that particular school which is growing at a significant rate.  However, it is growing in the wrong community and it is not serving the community for which it was designated.</p>  <p>  The secondary school has a school principal but no school building.  It was supposed to open last year.  While I appreciate the sensitivities around land acquisition, the Mooretown site was identified by myself and other councillors over a decade ago, but we are no further along the road of identifying a site that can be acquired in the Malahide-Portmarnock community area.  I appreciate that the Department has particular budgetary constraints but if we designate an area for a non-denominational school, we have to back it up with the purchase of a site.  I cannot understand how we are no further along three years later with the secondary school delayed and no site for the primary school.</p></speech>

The Malahide-Portmarnock Educate Together primary school has six classes accommodated in the Teagasc building in Kinsealy.</p><p>There was an evaluation of sites but they ultimately proved unviable.  A potential permanent site has been identified and is being progressed in respect of the secondary school.  In both cases the Department must work with others to bring the project ashore.  That is what is being done.  It is working with Fingal and the interests concerned to try to meet this demand.  It is a difficult area, and this is something we are finding in the city area where potential sites are scarce and difficult to come by but the Department is actively working on the procurement of sites for the two schools.</p></speech>

I commend the work and the commitment that is there but according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, we have significant growth in the two communities and the demand for schooling places is now critical in Malahide and Portmarnock, especially at second level.  There is a commitment to deliver a new school for Portmarnock by way of a new school building for Portmarnock community school but that commitment must be delivered on now.  We identified Malahide-Portmarnock as requiring a non-denominational school.  The Department of Education and Skills did that identification.  That process began in 2012 and now, in 2018, we still do not have a site.  I welcome the fact that the school is operational.  We have a significant difficulty with secondary education.

We have two Educate Together schools designated for the general community.  Should they not share a site?

I understand that separate sites are identified for these two schools that are being progressed and I shudder to suggest that we should scrap the progress that has been made and come up with another approach.  I fear that would delay the project.  I do not have the detailed knowledge of the issues being negotiated for the very reason that they are commercially sensitive and are being negotiated with the individuals.  My knowledge is that two sites are being progressed and the Department is working in good faith to bring those to conclusion.  I will not suggest that we pull back on what is in progress unless the patron body makes a clear case to the Department that it would improve delivery.

We are hiring more teachers than at any other time in the State's history.  As the Deputy has indicated, issues have arisen.  The provisions of the career break scheme are set out in chapter eight, Terms and Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A career break is period of special leave and the main objectives of this scheme is for employers, wherever possible, to facilitate applicants in the areas of personal development, voluntary service overseas, to accompany a spouse or partner on a diplomatic or military posting, for education, public representation, child care or dependent care, and self-employment.</p>  <p>  In response to reported difficulties by schools with regard to recruiting substitute teachers, my Department issued notification on 26 January that it was suspending the restrictions regarding substitution limits for those on a career break for the current school year.  Prior to this decision the limits were 90 days in primary schools and 300 hours in post primary schools.  The notification also reminded employers that &ldquo;in considering applications for career breaks, the welfare and educational needs of the pupils shall take precedence over all other considerations and accordingly, must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers".  I understand from representations received that suspending the restrictions as outlined will provide immediate assistance to some schools finding it difficult to recruit qualified substitute teachers.</p></reply>

I have spoken to him about this on foot of my experience as chair of a board of management and it is a situation which other schools are also facing.  Boards are in a difficult position.  They want to be flexible with teachers who come to the board seeking a career break but it has been extremely difficult.  Today is the deadline for applications for this year.  I know that there will be boards which will dread that first meeting in February where these decisions will have to be made.  What the Minister has said here is very clear.  Time will tell if suspending those restrictions will have the effect that the Minister says it will have.  There are so many demands on boards of management, which are voluntary.  This directive and the Minister's input could be very helpful in resolving the inordinate number of career break requests that some schools are getting.</p></speech>

Its purposes are set out in the answer I just gave.  The scheme is not for purposes such as switching career.  The obligation is on the board of management to decide on the matter.  I am happy to leave the arrangement where it is, namely, with the decision made at local level, but the boards must bear in mind the needs of the children and the boards' capacity to replace the teacher.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the problem regarding substitution, people on career break can be part of a solution.  There are also significant number, in fact a majority, of teachers who are retiring under the age of 60 years.  If they remain registered, they can provide substitution hours.  Student teachers in their final year of study can be considered for substitution.  We are looking at all sources of supply.  I have established a teaching supply group to monitor other possible actions.</p></speech>

That has also been driving the request for career breaks.</p>  <p>  On the Teaching Council and registration, I know of teachers who retired under the age of 60 years whose registration with the Teaching Council lapsed, or in some cases they may not have thought they would return to the classroom.  The Teaching Council could be encouraged to speed up the process, particularly in the cases of teachers who have been registered in the past but let it lapse because they did not think they would come back to teaching but now there is a need for them to return. </p></speech>

The difficulty with the question of career break is that if someone has a permanent post and they leave, it can only be filled with a temporary post, which is less attractive for the school and the teacher.  Career breaks need to be thought out by the school for that reason.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there are pressures in housing and so on, but we are trying to manage this.  The difficulty arises in part because we are recruiting such a high number of posts.  We are recruiting 5,000 teachers in two years, which is a significant rate of recruitment.  It might have been the case that there were more teachers who were interested in part-time posts who now have access to full-time posts.  That also changes the environment.  There are several issues that must be monitored.  I am also making changes in initial education to try to improve the supply.</p></speech>

This has created serious difficulties for many families.  This is a particular issue in more remote parts of rural Ireland.

He has met Deputies who have suggestions and concerns.  I suppose I need to outline the position.  It is a significant operation.  It is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Some 115,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in 4,500 vehicles to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country each day.  These vehicles cover approximately 100 million km each year.  This service was provided at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  I think the relevant distance at primary level is 3.2 km and at secondary level is 4.8 km.  It is important to note that all eligible children are accommodated under the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments in the programme for Government, a review of the concessionary charges and rules element of the school transport scheme has been undertaken.  The review, which was published in December 2016, made recommendations on the charges and the rules elements of the concessionary school transport scheme.  The recommended course of action in respect of the charges for concessionary school transport was to continue with the current policy of imposing charges in respect of those in receipt of concessionary places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.  The report also recommended that the number of concessionary places should be reduced in line with the rules introduced in 2012 on a phased basis.  Previous plans to advance this option were put on hold, pending the completion of the review.  After considering the review and discussing the matter with the cross-party working group which was established to feed into the review, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, decided there should be no planned programme of downsizing in the coming years, other than in line with normal operational decisions under the current scheme.  The terms of the school transport scheme are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been very forthcoming and receptive to meetings with all of us.  He indicated in response to a Topical Issue I raised in this Chamber that a small amount of additional money would enable him to provide a better service to many people.  The Minister has quite rightly pointed out that significant resources are invested in the school transport scheme, which is particularly important in rural Ireland.  We can talk about introducing various schemes with the aim of regenerating rural Ireland, but if we do not have a satisfactory school transport scheme there will be a substantial deficit in rural Ireland.  Everyone who has the privilege of representing a rural constituency - my colleagues, Deputies Niall Collins and Eugene Murphy, represent constituencies that are much like my constituency - knows that many families decide to set up homes in rural parishes on the basis of access to schools and availability of transport to primary and secondary schools.  I appreciate that there will always be difficulties in any overall general scheme that is based on boundaries.  There needs to be some flexibility in decision-making at local level.  As we all know, changes in the old catchment areas that were assigned to schools that closed in the past can mean that rural communities fall into different towns or villages.  In cases in which older siblings went to certain post-primary centres, flexibility is needed to ensure younger siblings are not denied the transport services that were available to other family members.  If those services are not available, it will impose an additional cost burden on families.</p></speech>

If we want the rules to apply nationally on an equitable and fair basis, we need to ensure they apply in every community.  The rules cannot differ from one community to another.  The Deputy is looking for a different rule to apply in his area because of its special circumstances.  The problem is that a scheme cannot be run on that basis.  We have rules and criteria relating to the distance from the school and the question of whether it is the nearest school.  Children have been accommodated in circumstances in which there were places on local buses.  They were always accommodated on the basis that it was not being done as of right.  The Deputy is suggesting that we should create a right for such children.  That would be an entirely new rule and it would have to be applied everywhere.  Many better brains than my brain have tried to grapple with what the Deputy is saying, but they have not been able to move away from the sort of rules-based approach that guarantees equity to every community.</p></speech>

I said that additional costs should not be imposed on a family that has had a traditional pattern of attendance at a post-primary centre in the event that the level of school transport service that was made available to older siblings in that family is denied to a younger sibling who is about to enter secondary school.  In recent years, the use of Google maps when people have been applying for school transport online has resulted in distances being measured using roads that are not capable of carrying motor cars or school transport buses.  It is that context that I am talking about local flexibility and local knowledge.  I fully appreciate that a scheme cannot be designed to suit every family.  We should have flexibility.  Past patterns of attendance should be taken into account.  That washes out of the system anyway as the years go on.  By and large, all the difficulties being encountered by specific families, with which all of us have dealt, will be ironed out within a few years.  I remind the Minister that many of the costs associated with the concessionary transport scheme are being met by families that are under financial pressure.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to consider the point that a little modern imagination should be used when the rules are being defined at local level.  It has been shown that it is possible for this to be done without breaching the national rules.  As Deputy Smith has said, a precise measurement can sometimes be achieved by satellite but, depending on the circumstances, this is sometimes not possible.  I would like this to be looked at along the lines mentioned by Deputy Smith.  Such an approach would be beneficial in reaching a solution that removes much of the angst in a local area without any breaching of rules.</p></speech>

It has doubled to 27,000 in the last four years.  The core number of eligible pupils who always get their transport delivered is 77,000.  As I understand it, the problem that has arisen is that some people who have been receiving concessionary transport feel that they and their siblings should have an entitlement on the basis that a pattern has been established.  That is where problems arise.  I can understand exactly what the Deputies are saying.  I have not seen a solution that involves allocating the existing budget of &euro;190 million in a different way that is seen to be fair to all communities and treats all communities in an equitable way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has grappled with this difficulty, as others did before him.  I do not have a solution I can offer to the Deputies.  The Minister of State is always open to considering suggestions and evaluating them with the officials concerned.</p></speech>

The Department of Health has established an intra-departmental group, chaired by the chief medical officer, to address the ancillary recommendations of the joint committee.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will engage with the Department of Health on this ancillary recommendation.</p>  <p>  Access to sexual health and relationships education is an important right for students.  Schools have a responsibility to provide for it, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.  However, it is important to note that the ethos of the school must not preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge set out in the curriculum.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, which includes relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and the junior cycle.  RSE is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle.  My Department has set out the content of each of the programmes in the SPHE and RSE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the SPHE curriculum at primary level will undergo a review by the NCCA as part of the ongoing review of the curriculum.  A review of the curriculum at senior cycle is also under way and the SPHE programme at that level will be considered.  The reviews will include the views of all of the education partners, recent research outcomes, societal and cultural changes, and existing policies and teaching materials.  SPHE and RSE form integral parts of the new well-being area of learning at junior cycle.</p></speech>

My key concern is about impartiality and the provision of factual information.  The religious ethos of the majority of schools is preventing young people from receiving vital information that will allow them to make choices in life.  There seem to be more laws to protect the rights of the institution over those of the young person.  I sent a question to the Minister on 18 January on RSE being delivered by Accord, a Catholic organisation that does not, for example, deal with same-sex couples in marriage counselling services, despite the outcome of a massive referendum.  Its representatives are going into hundreds of schools, including ETB schools which do not have a Catholic ethos; therefore, young people who are LGBT are not receiving what should be reflected in their lives.</p></speech>

In 2017 it provided contextualised school-based supports for 3,084 primary and 2,100 post-primary teachers.  There is investment by the Department to make sure the teachers who deliver the programme have the skills to do so.  That was just one year of the programme's activities.  As I emphasised in my initial reply, there are no options in the delivery of the programme.  Schools cannot opt out of certain parts of the sexuality education programme being delivered.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the use of outside organisations, there are very clear guidelines from the Department which are included in circulars to primary and post-primary schools.  They state that where an outside speaker is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school, that he and or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it, that it is the responsibility of the school to ensure outside speakers are aware of the school policy and that the full content of the curriculum is delivered.  It is not envisaged that outside providers will deliver the core curriculum in this area, although they can be a supplement to it.</p></speech>

In 2016 Accord delivered courses in 53 secondary schools and all 347 Catholic primary schools in Dublin.  ETB schools also avail of its services.  In response to a related question I sent to the Minister yesterday, he stated he would review the funding of the Meitheal and Ember programmes because even though they were not in the area of RSE, they were related to student self-esteem and development.  The programmes have been receiving an endowment from the State, even though they are denominational and only deal with young people who are Catholic.  We also find that boys' schools do not provide sex education as much as girls' schools.  Girls are meant to be the gatekeepers when it comes to sexuality.  There is an ethos which is based on waiting until the time is right; it is not an all-encompassing view of sexuality but tends to be about watching out for this and not doing it.  There is a clear link between quality sex education and lower levels of crisis pregnancies.  Surely that is something in which there should be an interest in developing.</p></speech>

It expressed concerns about the period during which the programme was delivered and the fact that it could be delivered as part of religious education.  As the Department has made clear, schools do not have the option of not delivering the full curriculum.  The Deputy and the committee are right - we need to have a look at the programme and that is what the committee will do.  It made the comment that many teachers were not comfortable teaching RSE and that, therefore, it was left to a minority of teachers or outsourced to an agency.  Clearly, this needs to be looked at.  As I stated, agencies cannot be used to provide the entire programme.  While agencies can deliver part of it, the school must have a comprehensive programme to deliver it.  Of course, the inspectorate will have to be satisfied that that is the case.  These are important points, points the group will examine and that we will take seriously.  I wanted to give the Deputy the background to the existing policies and what supports were available for schools to ensure the programme was delivered properly.</p></speech>

All statutory approvals have been secured.  The stage 2b submission has been reviewed by the Department and comments were issued to the school and its design team in December 2017.  The Department has requested confirmation from the design team that it will carry out one final review of all of its tender documentation to ensure compliance with departmental requirements.  The design team has been requested to submit written confirmation from each design team member, including the project supervisor design process, PSDP, that it has completed the review and is satisfied that the tender documents are complete, correct and in compliance with departmental requirements and the amended building control regulations on tender documentation.  On receipt of the requested confirmations, the Department will revert to the school on the further progression of the project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the funding pressures on the capital programme and the need to focus limited funding on the provision of additional school places to cater for demographic demands.  The Department is reviewing its programme for capital expenditure in 2018 and into 2019.  Building projects, including St. Mary's national school, will be considered in that context.  Officials from the Department will shortly be in contact with the school about a timeframe for progression of the project.</p></speech>

That is not good enough and I must make a political charge.  It appears, in the case of this and many other schools, that there is deliberate procrastination at all stages.</p><p>The Minister refers to funding and capital expenditure.  Bringing the project to a stage at which the Minister can go to tender with it will not cost anything.  The school has 447 pupils, of whom 157, or 35%, are permanently based in prefabs.  They will have passed through the system before we receive the necessary approval.  There is running water in only four classrooms.  The main building was built in 1958 and extended later.  The planning period for the new school had expired and we had to seek a further duration of five years.  I am worried because we can do this only once.  Therefore, I implore the Minister to issue a political directive to the Department to move on the project as quickly as possible to allow it to go tender later this year.</p></speech>

However, it needs to be satisfied that the tender process is robust and that has been done.  It then has to be satisfied, as it releases projects to tender, that it is in accordance with the funding available.  It has to plan and manage the process as best as possible.  I agree that it would be best to give schools a roadmap to show how this occurs.  The Department is trying to improve in that area in order that schools understand the road ahead.  I acknowledge the difficulty highlighted by the Deputy and will talk to the officials to see if communication with the school can be improved.</p></speech>

I will deal with these projects on another day, but I implore the Minister to ask the officials to move quickly.  The letter from the Department, dated 21 December, should be dealt with without delay.  I realise the Minister is responsible for the country and that Deputies represent counties, but there were school projects further down the list that have been built and the children are in state-of-the-art classrooms.

The policy also seeks to improve the quality of teaching through Irish to ensure existing teachers' Irish language proficiency and pedagogical knowledge, skills and competence will be enhanced to a level that will equip them to deliver high quality Irish medium education.  In that context, the Department has been working with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to develop a request for tenders for the design and delivery of two new Irish medium teacher education programmes, comprising a full-time four-year Irish medium initial teacher education B.Ed. primary teaching programme and a part-time two-year Irish medium M.Ed. postgraduate blended learning programme.  It is expected that the successful tenderers will be announced in the coming weeks.  The M.Ed. programme which will provide up to 30 places annually is due to commence from September 2018, while the B.Ed programme, also with up to 30 places annually, is due to commence from September 2019.</p>  <p>  Also in implementing the policy, the Department made arrangements for the secondment from September 2017 of two additional teaching posts to the M&aacute;istir Gairmi&uacute;il san Oideachas, MGO, programme at the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, which is an Irish medium post-primary ITE programme.  This initiative will allow for an increase in the supply of Irish medium post-primary teachers through a range of measures, including the upskilling of student teachers, outreach, online and blended learning opportunities in the second year of the programme. </p>  <p>  I will shortly announce the establishment of a teacher supply steering group to consider teacher supply issues at primary and post-primary level, including the provision of adequate numbers of teachers in key subject areas such as Irish.</p></reply>

This followed the decision by SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, to withdraw late last year.  Three of the most experienced and established utility companies in the State have opted out of the Government process to provide broadband infrastructure to 542,000 homes and business premises dotted throughout rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the Fine Gael-led Government promised that broadband would be rolled out to every premises in the State by 2016.  That did not happen.  Yesterday's announcement signalled the collapse of the Government's plan.  When negotiating a programme for Government, in which the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, played a key role, the Government indicated that a deal would be done and a contractor would be appointed by June 2017.  That date slipped.  Virtually every date that the Government has set since talking about a national broadband plan has been missed.</p>  <p>  When asked repeatedly in the House to outline the projected contract signing date and the dates on which work would begin and be completed, the Minister dodged the questions and instead waxed lyrical about all of the broadband that was being rolled out throughout Ireland, failing to mention that it was being rolled out by commercial operators based on their commercial decisions and, in many cases, duplicated a pre-existing service in densely populated areas.</p>  <p>  From his former role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste knows the profile and character of rural Ireland.  He knows the kind of people whom he has met on his visits there.  He knows the farming communities, the small communities and the small businesses that support farming and require access to high-speed broadband.  He knows the people who live in rural Ireland and the students who come home at the weekend or every night and need access to broadband in order to pursue their studies.  People living in rural Ireland need access to broadband to conduct their banking and for their basic life pursuits, but they have been continuously deprived of it and have been sold a pup time after time.</p>  <p>  When Vodafone and the ESB pulled out of the process, it should have raised a red flag in the Department concerned, but it did not.  The withdrawal of Eir should have signalled a crisis in the process, but it has not.  Amazingly, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has welcomed the clarity provided by the withdrawal of Eir.  He believes that shovels will be in the ground more quickly and that the project will now be delivered on budget and ahead of schedule.  What cybergalaxy is the Minister living in?  The situation is farcical.  Months of detailed negotiations are still to take place between the remaining bidder and the Government on pricing and technical matters, so there is no guarantee that a deal can be arrived at or if the deal proposed by the Government will remain viable for the 25 years of the contract.  The last thing the 542,000 homes and businesses need is another false dawn or, worse still, a contract that collapses a few years into operation.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed that this infrastructure should have been built and owned by the State.  The Minister rejected that proposition, claiming that it would create significant delays to the project.  The Government put its faith in the market, but the market has turned its back on the Government.  In light of what has happened, will the Government now consider changing the nature of the tender so that the State will take responsibility for building and owning this infrastructure?</p></speech>

Like many Deputies, I grew up on a farm in a rural community.  I know the responsibility the Government has to ensure that people in rural Ireland as well as people in urban centres can access the information and the opportunity that the Internet provides.  They need speed to be able to do that and, by and large, delivering that speed requires fibre, which is exactly what the Government is committed to delivering by effectively State sponsoring the roll-out of broadband to the 500,000 or so households that currently do not have it.  We are going to see that through.</p>  <p>  We have been through a very complex tendering process to get there in terms of finalising a tender that will last for 25 years.  That has been a competitive process.  In many competitive processes, commercial operators pull out for commercial reasons if the processes do not suit them.  That is what has happened here.  We also have another operator - there is now only one left - that has been adamant that it is committed to this process.  It wants to work with the Government on it and believes that it can do this.</p></speech>

We are expecting it to be concluded by September so that we can roll out State-sponsored broadband delivery rapidly after that.  This is on top of what is already happening commercially, with about 300 farms per week, if the Deputy wants to raise the issue of agriculture, getting access to broadband.  We want to accelerate that in parts of Ireland that do not have commercial solutions.</p>  <p>  The idea that we should at this stage, because one operator has pulled out and we have another operator confirming that it wants to get on and do the business, stall the whole process and ask for another panel of experts to make recommendations would mean that nothing would happen for probably years and we would be starting all over again.  The Minister has an assurance that, actually, we are almost where we need to be in terms of spending hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money to make sure that rural Ireland gets the broadband it needs.</p><p>We are going to see this through.  It has been complex and difficult, but we were only months away from approving a preferred bidder before September.  That has essentially been fast-forwarded now and we need to work with Enet and others in the consortium which are big players in the sector.  This is not a small operation.  It is as big as the ESB or some of the bidders which have pulled out.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is now suggesting that the Government now somehow has the upper hand.  It is at the market and there is only one person there.  Its back is to the wall.  If the Government thinks it will be able to achieve the deadline which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, keeps avoiding questions on or that somehow it will get value for money for the taxpayer, it needs to wake up because it is not going to happen.</p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is that the two companies with the greatest footprint in the State, the greatest experience and the most established operators which understand the marketplace have pulled out.  If it is not plain to the T&aacute;naiste and the Government that there is a serious problem with the contract and tender it is proposing, then it does not understand what is going on.  It is about time that the Government faced up to what is happening.  People are deeply concerned that the Government is not even committed to providing broadband to the 540,000 homes which need it.

In 1994, an agreement was reached between the CI&Eacute; employees and the company to amalgamate five pension schemes, thereby allowing it to remove a potential &euro;73 million pension deficit from its book.  In return, employees were given certain assurances, the first of which was that the board of CI&Eacute; would guarantee the solvency of the pension schemes each year.  The second commitment given was that there would be regular post-retirement increases, but no specific rate was given.</p>  <p>  The company stuck to those commitments until 2009 when it failed to provide sufficient funding to ensure the solvency of the schemes in that year and in the following years.  This was against the advice tendered by the company's actuary.  Since then, the board of CI&Eacute; has underfunded the pension scheme to the tune of around &euro;80 million.  The assurance given by the Minister states: "In every year there shall be a contribution from the board to a fund of such sum as the board after consulting the actuary determines to be necessary to support and maintain the solvency of the fund."  Despite this, neither the Government nor the Minister has intervened to ensure that CI&Eacute; adheres to that order.  A blind eye has been turned to it.</p>  <p>  Not only has the company underfunded the pension scheme, by extension it has jeopardised the solvency of both CI&Eacute; pension scheme funds.  This issue was raised by the NBRU and SIPTU.  Yesterday, I proposed to the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that we invite the unions in to discuss these issues with the committee.  It has agreed to do that.  We will hear the unions' side of the story this month.</p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste that to remember that we are talking about people's pensions.  Last year, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was very unhappy with the prospect of being a lot poorer because a large part of his pension from Independent News &amp;amp; Media was being cut.  He blasted the proposals at that time as very unfair and unreasonable.  I sincerely hope he sees the seriousness of this issue for the thousands of workers in CI&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  The Government and Department have serious questions to answer.  Once again, it comes back to accountability and oversight pure and simple.  It is also an issue which has been known about by successive Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, one of whom is the current Taoiseach and another of whom is the Minister for Finance.  It is not an issue the Government can ignore the because CI&Eacute; has a legal obligation to adhere to the Minister's directive.</p>  <p>  When was the underfunding of the pension scheme brought to the attention of the Minister?

Like many other semi-State companies, CI&Eacute; has a responsibility towards its pensioners and workers who will be future pensioners in terms of ensuring that pension funds are solvent.  Many, if not all, of the semi-State companies and agencies have sought to restructure pension funds accordingly.  The ESB and Coillte have done so.  CI&Eacute; has worked with unions to ensure that there is an understanding around funding pension funds appropriately for the future.  There is an obligation on the board and management of CI&Eacute; to work with union representatives to make sure that is the case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy said she will have an opportunity to tease some of those things out in committee and hear the concerns of unions, which I welcome.  I would also like to make it very clear that boards and management in semi-State companies have a responsibility to face up to pension challenges, as the private sector has been doing for years.  That sometimes involves co-operation and compromise from the union side.  If that is not possible, then there is an infrastructure in the State to help to find compromise and resolution to those issues and problems.  CI&Eacute; should be no different.</p></speech>

It boils down to the fact that the Government has allowed CI&Eacute; to show blatant disregard for a ministerial order.  The issue was raised today in the Committee of Public Accounts by my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General said this was a statutory, rather than a private, pension scheme.  There are legislation and statutory instruments.  The Minister knows what "statutory" means - it means responsibility and with responsibility comes accountability.  The Government has allowed this to happen but I am quite sure it would not allow it to happen to its members' pensions, or I should say their multiple pensions.  Over 10,000 CI&Eacute; workers have been left in limbo for the past eight years because the Government has allowed CI&Eacute; to ignore statutory instruments.  The Government cannot hide behind CI&Eacute; on this issue.  CI&Eacute; has, quite simply, broken the law and I wonder if the T&aacute;naiste would care a bit more about it if it related to his pension.  Was this issue not brought to the Cabinet's attention?</p></speech>

There are hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across the country currently without access to high-speed broadband.  The tendering process collapsed yesterday when Eir withdrew, the second bidder to do so.  A tendering competition with one bidder is not a procurement process and I say that as the person who as Minister brought the last three procurement directives through the European Parliament.  The notion that the Minister would now portray this latest development as a good thing is delusional at best and cynically misleading at worst.  There is only one bidder so, by definition, the State now has no choice as to who will deliver the national broadband plan to 500,000 homes and businesses and it will only happen if the price of Enet can be afforded.</p>  <p>  The incompetent way in which this has been handled leaves the State over a barrel on price and the timeframe of implementation.  In effect, the country is now snookered and the Minister and his Department have lost control of the process.  The delays in rolling out the plan have allowed the dominant, near-monopoly player to increase its market share.  The original basis of the plan was critically undermined when the Minister allowed Eir to cherry pick over 300,000 homes in April 2017.  Was there an evaluation of the plan at that time, or of the consequences of that decision?  If one removes all the lucrative parts of any contract one should not be surprised when private businesses, which already dominate the market, decide they already have what they want and walk away from the process.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, must take responsibility for this disaster.  He managed to turn what had been a solid process into a mess, all in less than two years.  SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, withdrew from the tendering process in September stating there was no longer a business case once those 300,000 premises had been removed.  That only left Eir and Enet.  The Minister has facilitated a market grab by the largest player in the field, which already has a dominant position.  Through the delays in delivering the plan, Eir has been able to build an even more dominant position and undermine the prospect of a credible roll-out plan.</p>  <p>  The process over the past two years has driven credible providers out of the market.  Yesterday's news leaves more than 500,000 homes and businesses with no prospect of viable connectivity in the years to come.  Will the Government apologise to those who will now wait years for broadband, with no clear timeframe for when they will get it?  Is it not now the case that the State is totally beholden to one provider which can name its price, determine the timeframe and laugh at the Government?</p></speech>

The other 500,000 justifies, under State aid rules, significant public expenditure to pay for the roll-out of broadband and that is what is going to happen.  A number of operators have been part of this process and some have chosen to pull out but that does not mean companies have not submitted costings.  People are talking as if we are starting again.  We are not starting again but are at the very end of a very complex process which the Deputy set up.  We have one absolutely viable consortium which wants to do this with the State and has confirmed that again today.  It has submitted costings and we want to develop a partnership with it to make sure the 500,000 homes which need broadband, but would not get it under commercial conditions, will get it because it will be sponsored by the State.</p>  <p>  Our only focus is to get broadband to homes in rural Ireland as quickly as we can do that and that was the motivation behind giving the go-ahead for Eir to roll out broadband to 300,000 homes.  The other 500,000 which are still waiting, in frustration, expect the Government to find a way of getting fibre to them as quickly as we can.  Ending this process and starting all over again with a panel of experts is not the way to do this.  We have loads of experts advising us on this.</p></speech>

In the main, the focus has been on the economy and preparing the Irish economy for the impact.  We have had so many discussions around business, agriculture, jobs, the Single Market, the customs union, the common travel area and how the Good Friday Agreement is being undermined.  I look at all that and the drive, energy, work and commitment.  I know it is very necessary but I also look at what is happening in the north inner city where I am looking for even a fraction of that drive, energy and commitment on the issues that have seen such an escalation in violence, a callous indifference to life and the neglect of those communities and their way of life.</p>  <p>  I have heard comments that this violence and the number of murders in a small area would not be tolerated if it was to happen in the leafy suburbs of Dublin or Cork.  I suppose it would not be tolerated but that is missing the point.  The point is that it is not happening there and it would not happen there.  It is because those leafy suburbs were not neglected in the way the communities in the north inner city have been over many years and through many Governments when one looks at the difference between the areas in terms of housing, infrastructure, environment, the health of the residents, jobs, careers, disposable income, access to a variety of social activities and progression in education.  I would ask how much open drug dealing is happening on the streets of those leafy suburbs.  It is because of that difference that the inner city has been a fertile ground for the drug industry and all the mayhem, chaos and violence it brings.  It is telling that it took a string of murders to bring attention and focus on those issues in the north inner city.  </p>  <p>  I know it will not change overnight and I acknowledge the work that has started and the work of the garda&iacute; and their successes through their intelligence gathering but the reality is that there was another murder on Tuesday night, the evening before the funeral of another murder victim.  I think back to the first murder, which took place during the last election, but now it is almost like "oh, another murder in the north inner city, more of the gangland feud" and then it is forgotten about until the next one.  It is likely that there will be more.  The residents of the north inner city, particularly young people, teenagers and senior citizens, deserve the same respect as those who live in those leafy suburbs and they also deserve the same right to a peaceful existence enjoyed by people in other areas.  This will not happen unless there is a real urgency and a real commitment to tackle those issues that have brought about the chaos we are experiencing.  </p></speech>

The State's response here has to be across multiple different areas and initiatives.  From a justice and policing point of view, the type of criminal behaviour we have seen again this week has no place in a civilised society and will not be tolerated by the Government.  We are putting resources in place to ensure that this is the case.  Operation Hybrid has been established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and to address public safety concerns about community safety.  Operation Hybrid benefits from significant support by armed support units.  If we look at the result of that Garda response as of 21 January last, we see 72 arrests;13 charges in total, of which ten related to murder investigations and three of which related to other related offences; 34 firearms seized; in the region of 260 searches; and over 15,000 lines of inquiry conducted with more than 50,000 high-visibility checkpoints.  There is a significant step up in terms of Garda presence.</p>  <p>  I accept that this is not enough in terms of the State's collective response.  This is why under the previous Taoiseach, who felt very strongly about this issue, as does the current Taoiseach, we set up a north-east inner-city initiative to which the Deputy contributed in terms of the thinking on that chaired by Michael Stone.  The board includes representatives from the community and business sectors as well as key Government Departments and agencies.  The board has met every month since it was established last June and will shortly publish its 2017 report, including a comprehensive detailed report on spending across multiple areas from education to youth development to community development to sports facilities and all the other things that are a real deficit for communities living in this part of Dublin versus communities in other parts of Dublin.  That is a gap and deficit that this Government wants to overcome.  We will put very significant resources in place to try to do that.  </p></speech>

I go back to the point about inequality.  During last week's Leaders' Questions, I referred to the report from the World Economic Forum, which spoke about the income inequality in Ireland and the soaring wealth inequality.  It is that inequality that has led to the social deprivation and social neglect.  I really feel for young people.</p><p>Young people will not be able to realise their potential because they are living in an environment where they are open to exploitation and manipulation.  It is important that we get progress reports on the implementation of the Mulvey report.  We need to address the gaps identified by communities in the Mulvey report.</p></speech>

It is probably true to say there has never been better co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI than there is today.  We need to ensure through Brexit and post Brexit that co-operation is maintained and sustained so that vulnerable people who are being targeted by criminal gangs are protected North and South, and that the movement of gangs across the Border is addressed in as comprehensive a way as we can address it from a security point of view.</p>  <p>  The Government does not disagree with the concerns here.  The shootings in the past week are horrific.  We need to ask constantly if we can do more.  I assure the Deputy that resources are not the problem here.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na asks for more, for example, an increased emphasis on community policing and more resources for that, the Government's response will be very positive.  Resources are not the issue here.  From a policing perspective we need to listen to and work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on what it needs.  From a broader community development perspective we need to reassess constantly.</p></speech>

I chair a stakeholders' group that meets regularly and all the key sectors the Deputy mentioned are represented there.  This is an ongoing conversation.

The T&aacute;naiste will know this is European cervical cancer prevention week, which is a critical issue.  The Irish Family Planning Association and CervicalCheck are running their annual Pearl of Wisdom campaign.  Each year 260 women in Ireland are diagnosed with cervical cancer and up to 70 lives are lost.  Public awareness on screening is essential and women aged between 25 and 60 can avail of regular free checks.</p>  <p>  However, we all remember the recent controversy over the HPV vaccine.

Those workers informed me that they do not get payslips.  They do not know what deductions are being made.  They say Romanian workers are being paid less than the sectoral employment agreement rates.  This stuff is rampant.  Agencies are being set up that are not registered, paying people less.</p></speech>

It does not involve the introduction of any further or updated legislation.  The Garda at national level in the area to which the Deputy refers and at international level through Interpol is actively engaged with other international police forces.  Should there be an appropriate level of evidence to be levelled against any suspect, we will operate under the time-honoured system of the European arrest warrant in the expectation that anybody who is not residing in the jurisdiction and who faces charges in this State can be properly returned under these conditions.</p></speech>

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the T&aacute;naiste will have an important role to play in this.  There is tremendous concern at the prospect of the offering from the EU to the Mercosur countries supposedly increasing from 70,000 tonnes to 99,000 tonnes in the negotiations last week.  For any final deal, will it be a situation where all countries have to agree, in that we would have a veto or will it be by qualified majority voting?  Does the T&aacute;naiste know that at this stage?  If we are so against it and the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have taken such a hard line, as they tell us, why is the European Commission proceeding with increasing the beef offering?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us information on that?  As negotiations continue over the next week, will the T&aacute;naiste get the ear of relevant Commissioners and ensure that beef is not sold out at the expense of doing a trade deal?</p></speech>

We are the largest beef exporter in the northern hemisphere.  The EU's market for beef is crucial for us in the future.  Any trade deal negotiated and finalised by the EU is one we are watching closely.  No final deal has been agreed to my understanding.  Ireland and other countries, particularly France, have raised concerns about the sensitive issue of beef.  The way in which the EU handles trade is that the Commission has the mandate to negotiate, but that negotiating mandate is determined by member states.  Ireland and France have continuously raised concerns that, if a deal is to be done, beef access needs to be part of that.</p></speech>

There is currently a critical situation where there are 700 farmers around the country who have contracts or partnerships with Coillte and are being treated abysmally by a semi-State company.  They are not being paid.  There is no communication.  It is a scandalous situation.  We need the Government to intervene.  I know it is a semi-State company and that it is at arm's length, but the way it is treating citizens is shameful.</p></speech>

The Government is conscious that there is an obligation to follow through on some of the legislation that is still outstanding to ensure consistency with the convention.  On the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which deals with the deprivation of liberty issues, the Government hopes to bring it forward, if not this term then very shortly after that, but I suspect it may well be dealt with this side of the summer.</p></speech>

We are working on the establishment of the scheme in conjunction with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, as part of the new change management programme.  The legislation in place may not be sufficient to do what we want to do with the RTB.  We may need to bring in new legislation to supplement the primary legislation.  We are moving to do what the Deputy suggests but doing so is not as simple as we thought it would be in terms of the existing legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100021#T00100"><p>I move Amendment No. 3:</p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes that&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;&mdash; the number of individuals or couples with a housing need that are neither eligible to apply for social housing because of the low income thresholds, nor able to afford to purchase a private home at current prices, far exceeds the approximately 100,000 on the social housing list, possibly by a factor of three;<br /><br />&mdash; since taking office in 2011, Fine Gael have not delivered a single affordable home through any Government scheme;<br /><br />&mdash; the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness contains no targets and no clear funding stream for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; the Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il Confidence and Supply Arrangement for a Fine Gael-led Minority Goverment has no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il have facilitated two Fine Gael budgets despite neither containing any credible proposals for delivering affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Budget 2018 proposals contain no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;90 million Help to Buy Scheme is driving up house prices and by the most generous estimate will help no more than 1,000 home purchases;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is unlikely to deliver significant numbers of genuinely affordable housing and may deliver no affordable homes in Dublin;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;25 million affordable housing fund announced in Budget 2018 will only deliver 650 affordable homes;<br /><br />&mdash; the revised local authority first-time buyers mortgage will be of limited value if genuinely affordable homes are not available to purchase;<br /><br />&mdash; the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones has not constrained rents by 4 per cent, particularly with respect to new tenancies;<br /><br />&mdash; no affordable homes will be delivered by any Government scheme in 2018; and<br /><br />&mdash; no precise definition of affordable rental homes has been forthcoming but the indications that such rents would be pitched at approximately 80 per cent of market rates, or worked out on the basis of a 25 year cost recovery on the commercial construction cost, are in no manner &lsquo;affordable&rsquo;; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to:<br /><br />&mdash; immediately introduce regulations to ensure that, independent of commitments in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a minimum of 20 per cent affordable housing is delivered in all private developments;<br /><br />&mdash; directly construct 100,000 council and affordable homes over the next five years;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately establish what price or rent level is defined as affordable and to ensure that this is genuinely affordable for those on average incomes above the eligibility threshold for council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; achieve mixed income public housing estates through a combination of affordable housing but also by raising the eligibility criteria for renting local authority homes, at minimum, to include all with a housing need that cannot purchase privately at current market rates;<br /><br />&mdash; not deplete the public housing stock, as happened in the past, by making it mandatory that the local authority have first refusal in buying back affordable homes that occupants seek to sell;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately introduce an affordable housing scheme for public land that will ensure no land is sold off, in part or in whole, to private developers or landlords and further ensure that public private partnerships will not be considered in the context of council and/or affordable housing on public land;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that in any delivery of affordable homes on public land, all of these homes remain affordable into the future i.e. where purchasers do sell at a future date, they will be required to sell back to the local authority and that home will be either resold as affordable or revert to council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; fund the delivery of the affordable housing schemes through a combination of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund/Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), Housing Finance Agency and exchequer funding as appropriate, and provide local authorities with multi-annual funding commitments to facilitate forward planning;<br /><br />&mdash; design the HBFI fund to prioritise loan finance to small and medium-sized builders participating in council-led affordable housing schemes;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that all residential housing on National Asset Management Agency sites, or on sites supported by the Strategic Investment Fund, will be a mix of council and affordable housing only, with no housing on these sites being sold at market prices;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that all LIHAF and HBFI funded developments deliver, independent of any commitment in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, 40 per cent affordable homes as per the Government&rsquo;s original proposal for LIHAF, putting in place appropriate claw-back mechanisms to ensure the State benefits proportionately on any capital gain arising from future sale of these homes;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately scrap the failed &lsquo;Land Initiative&rsquo; and commit appropriate public funding to all council developments for projects currently underway in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Park and St Michael's Estate in Dublin City, The Grange/Kilcarberry in South Dublin and Shangannagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but ensure that all of these lands remain in full public ownership and that any affordable housing remains affordable into the future and that any tenure mix on these sites will ensure a majority percentage being developed as traditional council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; identify public sites around the country for similar council-led developments and introduce legislation to allow for the purchase of land needed to meet the public and affordable housing needs, at use value prices, and immediately bring forward plans similar to the Damastown proposal in Fingal and Whitechurch in Cork brought forward by Solidarity-People Before Profit public representatives;<br /><br />&mdash; commit the required funding to ensure the maximum council and affordable housing in the Poolbeg and Clonburris Strategic Development Zone's (SDZ) and to dramatically increase the proportion of council and affordable homes in the Cherywood SDZ;<br /><br />&mdash; amend Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to provide for a minimum of 20 per cent council housing requirement;<br /><br />&mdash; introduce real rent controls that allow local authorities to set rents at affordable levels and ensure that future rent increases are linked to an index such as the Consumer Price Index; and<br /><br />&mdash; defend and maintain the differential rent levels in local authority rented housing.&rdquo;</blockquote></speech>

He was murdered because of his name and as part of an ongoing feud that has, for the last number of years, dominated certain parts of this city.  Six days ago, there was another example of this feud and its damaging influence when gunshots were fired outside of the National Stadium on South Circular Road.  Two men were injured.  It was thought that one of the targets was a 40 year-old man.  The Garda stated that this is part of the ongoing feud, the Kinahan-Hutch dispute that has now been going on for two and a half years.  Then, two days ago, we saw another brutal murder.  A man was brutally murdered on the North Strand simply because of his association, it appears, with the Hutch family.  He too was only 27 years of age.</p>  <p>  These murders are brutal and cowardly for very many reasons.  First, they are brutal and cowardly because, as happened with the man who was murdered 11 days ago, people are lured to places against their will.  They are brutal and cowardly because people attack victims from behind as they are getting into a car and shoot them in the head.  They are brutal and cowardly because individuals are targeted because of their name, or because of their friendship with a particular family.  Most of all, they are brutal and cowardly because of the damaging and traumatic influence and impact the violence is having on the community in the north inner city, a very proud community that wishes, like any other, to ensure that its children are brought up in a safe and peaceful environment.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Over the last two and a half years or so, approximately 15 people have been murdered as a result of this feud.  It is simply unacceptable and we, as legislators and as politicians in this House, have to re-emphasise consistently that it is unacceptable.  I know there is no one, easy solution to this problem.  I know it is ongoing criminal activity that can only be resolved through investment in local communities, resources on the ground and responses by the Legislature to issues that must be raised.  They are the responsibility of different groups throughout society.  However, one of the entities - in fact, the entity - that has the most power to effect that change and fight this criminal activity is the Government.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is the Minister in this Government responsible for ensuring that the people of this city, the people of the north inner city, in particular, are kept safe.</p>  <p>  I want to know what the Minister for Justice and Equality is going to do about of this.  Something has to be done about it.  I want to know if, since he has the power, the Minister proposes to bring forward changes to the law.  I was particularly concerned when it was reported recently that the armed response unit and the special detective unit may have been subject to cutbacks.  We need to ensure that the Garda presence in the north inner city, which has been very effective over the last two years or so, is maintained.  We cannot just take our foot off the pedal in the hope that this problem will go away.  It has not gone away.  It is still there.</p>  <p>  Of course, the Minister is the central authority in the State for matters pertaining to extradition.  I know it is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but why is it, if individuals are masterminding these criminal acts from outside the State, that no steps are being taken to bring them to justice within this State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100023#Z00300"><p>I wish to thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this issue of great seriousness in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I will be addressing this issue from a criminal justice perspective, but of course it is important to note that the Government's focus on removing organised criminals' grip on areas is not confined to a criminal justice approach.  A multiplicity of supports are involved across a range of Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  The fatal shooting that took place earlier this week in Dublin's North Strand is currently under active investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The House will appreciate that the manner in which particular investigations are conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  I have no role in such investigations.  The shooting occurred within days of the brutal killing of Derek Hutch near Cloverhill Prison and the non-fatal shootings which took place outside the National Stadium on the South Circular Road on 26 January this year.  I wish to assure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also conducting a comprehensive investigation into both of these incidents.  I wish it well with its endeavours and inquiries, and I join the garda&iacute; in calling for anybody with any information to report that potential evidence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear.  This type of criminal behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  It will not be tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again.  I note that there has been some commentary this week to the effect that the State provides fewer resources to the policing of organised crime north of the River Liffey, or that little is done to stop gangland figures from killing each other.  Such assertions are ill-informed and without foundation.  In the first instance, the Garda has, in fact, prevented a huge amount of violence and crime in recent times.  Successes of this kind go under the radar and are not reported on the news on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that the Garda, supported by significant resources allocated to it by this Government, has made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in the north Dublin inner city area.  Operation Hybrid has been established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  It benefits from significant support by armed support units.  As of 21 January, this response has resulted in 72 arrests, 13 charges in total, 34 firearms seized, 260 searches, 15,260 lines of inquiry conducted and more than 50,450 high-visibility checkpoints implemented with active support from the armed support units.  A significant about of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence has also been examined.</p>  <p>  In addition, the conviction earlier this week in the Special Criminal Court of Eamonn Cumberton for the murder of Michael Barr in the Sunset House pub in April 2016, and the convictions of two other men apprehended in possession of a large number of firearms, were feud-related.  They came about as a result of concentrated efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle the perpetrators involved in this ongoing feud.  We have also seen reports of a series of very significant drug seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as important seizures of significant banking information used to fuel the activities of organised criminals.  These seizures have significantly hampered the ability of these gangs to operate.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not allow these criminals to prevail.  It will ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes will be apprehended and brought to justice as quickly as possible.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that these endeavours will continue to be fully supported by this Government. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100023#Z00400"><p>I agree with the Minister that this is not simply a criminal justice issue, but it is predominantly a criminal justice issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is the person within the Government who is responsible for criminal justice and for the resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  With respect to the Minister, it is not sufficient for him to simply state that he wishes the Garda well in these endeavours.  The Garda needs more than to be wished well by Government.  It needs to be given full and adequate resources to ensure that this vicious feud can be stopped, so that the people of the north inner city can be protected.  If, as the Minister said, the following is incorrect, I would like to see his statistics on the matter but it was reported that armed patrol units in the north inner city have been cut by 30% and that the covert backup by the special detective unit has also been cut.  If that is so, it needs to be reversed. </p><p>This is not the time to cut back on Garda resources just as the feud appears to be reigniting.  Everyone in the House has a responsibility which the Minister has recognised to ensure the people of the north inner city will not be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to their protection.  They are being exposed to a vicious, violent feud that is having a traumatic effect on families and young people in the vicinity.  We have a responsibility to ensure we face up to it and the best way to do that is to ensure the Garda has the resources it needs.  I ask the Minister to meet assistant Garda commissioner Leahy to ensure he is properly informed on whether adequate resources are being provided for the force.  Why are extradition requests not being submitted to European countries in respect of gangland criminals against whom there is sufficient evidence that they are responsible for instructing others to kill people on the streets of this city?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00200"><p>I meet the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda officers on a regular basis and will do so again in the near future.  Garda operations in Dublin's north inner city are underpinned by increased resources made available to the force by the Government.  In budget 2018 approximately &euro;100 million has been allocated for Garda overtime to support ongoing operations such as Operation Hybrid.  In 2016, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, funding was approved by the previous Government for the setting up of a dedicated armed support unit in the Dublin metropolitan region.  It is now operational on a 24/7 basis.</p>  <p>  The allocation and management of Garda resources, including the overtime budget, as the Deputy will be aware, are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, having due regard to operational needs.  I have no role in that regard.  It is a matter for Garda management to utilise the resources made available to it by the Government in the most efficient and effective manner, while also ensuring high visibility policing in communities to tackle the scourge of gangland crime head on.  Garda&iacute; are active on the international stage through Interpol and Europol and on a bilateral basis with other European states.  Action is well under way to ensure that if there is sufficient evidence, those responsible will be brought before the courts.  The Government has enacted legislation to target criminal activities further, including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2016 which provides additional powers for the Garda, in particular to immediately seizure assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them from being disposed of.</p>  <p>  While the allocation of Garda personnel is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I am advised that since January 2017, a number of new and additional garda&iacute; have been assigned to Store Street, Mountjoy and Bridewell Garda stations.  Furthermore, work is progressing towards the reopening of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, with funding for the project having been made available in the mid-term capital review.  A dedicated community policing office is also based in Store Street Garda station for the north central division to ensure the issues highlighted by the local community and stakeholders will be dealt with in an effective manner.</p>  <p>  All of the endeavours we have discussed will continue to be supported fully by me and my Government colleagues.  This type of crime will not be tolerated.  We will continue to stand with the people of the north inner city.</p></speech>

As a result, the remaining staff were left to work in extreme conditions.  With their union, they have been trying to secure adequate staffing levels to ensure patient safety.  Conditions got so bad that on 2 January, they were due to work to rule.  At the last minute, however, the HSE decided to reintroduce 14 agency staff for a period of one month.  That time is up and the HSE has informed staff that 16 nursing and five home care assistant posts will be lost.  What steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that will not happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00400"><p>As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien outlined, the hospital plays a crucial role in providing health services for people in the city and surrounding areas.  It provides rehabilitation and step-down facilities for patients from Cork University Hospital and the Mercy Hospital, which frees up a substantial number of acute beds.  The hospital has a number of vitally important rehabilitation wards.  In recent months it has come under severe pressure.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien outlined, the last minute reintroduction of agency staff in early January is coming to an end and it appears that 16 nursing and five home care assistant posts will be cut.  This will result in additional pressure being put on a hospital that is already under significant pressure.  The medical staff, particularly the nurses, are not only concerned about their working conditions but also about the effects on services and patient health.  This is happening at a time when we should be investing in health services, not cutting back.  It is wrong that there is any prospect of cutbacks at St. Finbarr's Hospital</p></speech>

As my colleagues outlined, cutting staff and creating a toxic environment in any hospital, never mind St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork, is criminal.  On top of this, we have heard the magic word "review".  A review is a money saving initiative on the part of the HSE.  One of the staff said, "We are just hanging in there."  If that is what passes for a job, the HSE and the Government have a lot to answer for.  I appeal to the Minister of State to treat the staff with respect.  They do a wonderful job and should be respected.  Given what they do, all nurses should be sent a "Thank You" card and beatified when they finish work.  It is not a job but a vocation.  I ask the Minister of State to address this issue in a humane way, not with statistics or a review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00600"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I thank the three Deputies for raising it and expressing their concerns.</p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and with independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what they and everybody in this House want.  We also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long-stay or short-stay basis.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St Finbarr's Hospital.  The hospital is part of the older persons social care directorate and one of 24 hospitals in the Cork Kerry Community Hospitals Group. </p>  <p>  The HSE has worked with the Irish Nursing and Midwives Organisation in recent months on staffing levels and ratios at the hospital.  HSE management has undertaken a review of staffing in consultation with the nursing unions, with a view to ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels and a skills mix to meet the care needs of the residents in long-term care and the rehabilitation wards.  It included a review of resource management, the skills mix and service costs.  The executive proposes to reconfigure the staffing levels and skills mix at the hospital to provide for optimum use of approved staffing resources and a reduction in the over-reliance on overtime and agency costs.  The current proposal, if implemented, will potentially provide for a reduction of 16.5 nursing whole-time equivalents and 5.1 health care assistant whole-time equivalents.  This will eliminate the reliance on the use of agency staff and maximise overall direct employment within the hospital.</p>  <p>  The HSE has assured the Department that there are no plans to reduce the number of directly employed staff at the hospital and certainly there are no plans for redundancies.  The Department understands the executive has demonstrated that staffing levels in terms of WTEs have increased in the past few years and that HSE management is satisfied that the reconfigured staffing levels will be adequate to provide the service being delivered.</p><p>The engagement between management, staff, the INMO and SIPTU is underpinned by the terms of the national public service stability agreement.  Agreement was not reached locally and notification was issued for the commencement of industrial action. The matter progressed to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, conciliation services and the parties met in December 2017.  Following subsequent correspondence and discussions, an interim arrangement was put in place without prejudice to either party&rsquo;s position and this has provided for the deferral of any industrial action, with the agreement to engage on the change programme as soon as possible.  This was in place until yesterday, 31 January.</p> <p> A conciliation conference has been organised by the WRC for 8 February 2018.  Management has agreed to an extension of the interim arrangements up to and including the date of the WRC conciliation conference and to not later than Thursday, 15 February which will allow a reasonable period for the parties to consider any proposal emerging from the WRC process.  This issue is being addressed by the HSE and key stakeholders through an agreed process, and officials from the Department will continue to monitor this situation carefully.  The HSE has been asked to keep the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, updated on developments.</p></speech>

She is saying that a review of staffing has been undertaken in consultation with the nursing unions with a view to ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels within the hospital.  Anyone reading that would presume that there may not be safe and adequate staffing levels at present and therefore we should be looking at increasing them.  However, the reconfiguration of staffing levels to ensure that there is a safe level of staff within the hospitals entails cutting 21 whole-time equivalent posts.  That makes no sense.  I am glad that the interim period is being extended until the issue comes before the WRC, but staff are telling us that the conditions are unsafe and the Minister of State's answer is not to employ more staff but to cut 21 posts.  It is ridiculous.</p></speech>

It seems extraordinary that the Department is asserting that there was consultation with the unions on staffing figures and yet the situation has proceeded to a work to rule and now to the Workplace Relations Commission.  That does not sound like an ordinary process.  It certainly does not seem that any points which may have been made by the unions in consultation were taken into account.  The Minister of State referred to agency staff and said that there is no threat to permanent staff, but it is clear that the global figure, inclusive of agency and permanent staff, will be reduced and nothing the Minister of State has said indicates the contrary.  On the basis of current proposals there will a reduction of 16 nursing staff and five home care assistants.  The Minister of State is saying that no permanent staff will be got rid of but the hospital will still be down staff.  That will put pressure on the permanent staff and will lead to a reduction in services.  The HSE and the Department need to back away from what is very clearly a cutback which will compromise safety and health care and will continue to put nurses, who are already in a precarious position, under extreme pressure.</p></speech>

We see the words "issue" and "review".  I do not believe a bit of it.  This has been festering for months.  Were it not for the bravery of the staff within St. Finbarr's Hospital in speaking out on this issue, it would not even have come to the fore.  The way staff are being treated is disgusting.  It beggars belief that we will not invest in our elderly people.  I have nothing against the agency staff, but we need to maintain a proper level of staff within our hospitals and give them a sense of purpose and belonging.  I hear that the issue is being addressed by the HSE but it has failed so many times that it is frightening.  I spoke to the INMO a while back and I was told that the HSE is spending &euro;2 million a week on agency staff.  I do not understand why we cannot retain our own staff, who are experienced and believe in what they do, within the system.  I ask the Minister of State to go back and get a proper black and white statement so that we can go back to the staff in St. Finbarr's and tell them that their jobs are secure and that they are doing a great job.</p></speech>

The HSE remains committed to ensuring an effective and efficient information and consultation process with the staff and the trade unions on the proposed change programme.  Management is satisfied that the proposed staffing levels and skill mix will be provided for the enhancement of nursing duties.

The Minister came back promptly with factual information on the numbers attending and so on.  I appreciate that.  However, my question was whether she had been made aware of the issue and what alternative steps she will take.  The reason I asked that question is that we have received very urgent representations, primarily from the most important people, namely, the parents of the children who will be affected.  That is more than 40 families.  Unusually for them, people from the legal profession - solicitors and barristers - have got together to say that this is an essential service.  They are publicly on the record as saying that this service must be kept.  Therapists and various other professionals who use the service have also made representations to us in respect of this service.</p>  <p>  This service was set up in 2007.  It has been there for more than ten years.  It has had two positive evaluations, one in 2008 and one in 2016.  Both pointed to the essential nature of the service and to the positive effect on children.  I do not have much time to speak on this but I will bring the Minister's attention to the conclusions of the 2016 report, where figures are given.  It says that the service enhances the positive relationships between parents and children and so on.</p><p>They cannot do without this service.  If it is closed, 40 or more families will be affected.  Primarily, children will not see their fathers.  It is run on a shoestring budget of approximately &euro;80,000 per year and has four staff, one of whom is full-time.</p> <p> We have spoken to the directors.  The only difficulty seems to relate to the governance structure and providing cover at the weekend.  Problems seldomly arise at the weekend.  The house costs nothing because it is in Tusla's ownership.  It will remain open and has ample space for the other services provided therein.  A number of Deputies met the directors last week.</p> <p> People with legal and psychological care backgrounds are happy to serve on the board, but they have never been contacted.  Last Monday, the directors confirmed to us that it was an essential service and they wanted it kept open at all costs.</p> <p> To repeat myself, it is run on a shoestring budget and there have been no problems on the ground.  The problem with the governance structure is not insurmountable.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughton has also done work on this issue.  I support what has been said.  It is important to recognise that all the Galway Deputies are concerned.</p>  <p>  Governance has become an issue when trying to get people involved in boards because they are afraid of the responsibilities.  It is fine when there is a large professional staff, but it would be a tragedy if important services were lost because people felt that there was too much governance and not enough backup to support it.  Money is useful because, if a board has money, it can buy expertise.</p>  <p>  This is a vital service and it should be supported.  We must decide that, where services are concerned, structures can never be more important than the reality on the ground.  Sometimes, important services cannot fit inside structures, but that is not a justification for not having the services.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to clarify the circumstances surrounding Time 4 Us and the wider picture of child contact centres.  We all agree that the long-term goal is a quality service delivered to all children in all areas.  However, it is important to ensure that any service delivered to children and families is of a high quality.  Services must be appropriate to local needs and sustainable.</p>  <p>  Child contact centres are safe, friendly and neutral places where children can spend time with the parent or parents with whom they do not live.  The centre provides a child-centred environment that allows the child to continue a relationship with the parent at the child's pace and in his or her own way, usually through play and child-centred activities.</p>  <p>  Services of this nature are used by children and families in a wide range of circumstances, some of which can be difficult or contentious.  These centres may also cater to children whose parents are separated and cannot agree contact arrangements.  Children in the care of Tusla, who need support to have access with their families, also use the service.  I paid attention to Deputy Connolly outlining aspects of that in this case.</p>  <p>  Time 4 Us was established in 2007.  The service's purpose is to provide parents who do not live with their children with a facility where they can spend time together.  A total of 41 families are currently using the service, 36 of which were referred by the courts or private family law services.  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's concerns relate to the funding of this service, but I will draw his attention to the additional reasons given by the board of directors for closing the service.  These include significant challenges in terms of board membership and sustainable governance, which Deputy Connolly referenced.  Several members of the board wish to retire in the coming years and the board has struggled to find suitable replacements.  It has also struggled to provide staff for weekend cover, which is a time of high demand.</p>  <p>  Time 4 Us operates an on-call rota at the weekend to provide support to the staff in the centres.  It previously received funding from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality as well as from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP.  In 2016, the service's main funding came from grants from Tusla and the Galway City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committee, with the remainder coming from the SVP.  However, the funding from the SVP has now ceased.</p>  <p>  A decision has been made by the board of directors to cease the service on 31 March.  Tusla will work with the board to identify alternative supports that current service users can avail of in the local area.  It is important to ensure that the services provided for access and contact are safe, of the highest quality and sustainable.</p></speech>

It has been brought to her attention that this is an essential service.  We cannot do without it.  Indeed, it should be rolled out nationally.  Of the reasons given, finance was not one.  It is run on a shoestring budget.  Staffing was not mentioned as a problem.  Four staff run it.  There were no difficulties at the weekend.  The primary difficulty related to the governance structure, that is, covering the weekend.</p>  <p>  Any number of people with adequate legal and psychological skills as well as other skills would serve on the board.  That is not a difficulty.  Rather, the problem is with the governance structure.  Only three directors are necessary.  Some want to retire, with which I do not have a difficulty.  They have done a good job.  The Minister is standing over the closure of this service because of a small problem with a governance structure.  Tusla has to step in and recognise that it must provide active support at the weekend.  Rarely does a problem arise.  We asked about all of this.  Will the Minister re-examine the matter and revert to us?</p></speech>

In a situation like this, the way forward is for people to meet face to face.  It seems to be going out of fashion in many facets of our lives.  I suggest that the people with responsibility for ensuring these types of service sit down, go through the issues and devise a solution.  Governance has rightly grown more onerous, but we must ensure that it does not become a barrier to the provision of services.  The assistance that is needed to provide that governance should be given.  The only way for this situation to be resolved is through face-to-face discussions around a table with the appropriate authorities.</p>  <p>  Money is an issue, given that the SVP withdrew its funding.  Where there is enough funding, one can buy any governance expertise that is required.</p></speech>

That said, I hear what the Deputies are saying.  In particular, Deputy Connolly referred to how there were barristers and psychologists who were willing to serve on the board.  That there were two positive reviews of the service is helpful information for me.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies can imagine, I am concerned about how family breakdowns are stressful for children.  Anything that can be done to assist them and their families in that context should have our support.  The question is one of how to do that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly asked whether we could re-examine the matter.  Deputies Naughton and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggested a face-to-face meeting.  I will commit to calling to arrange a meeting with members of the board - I will also ask Tusla to join us - in order to re-examine the situation and discuss the Deputies' points.  I will revert to the Deputies subsequently.</p></speech>
