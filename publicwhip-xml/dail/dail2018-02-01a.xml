    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00500"><p>I apologise for being slightly late.  I had to query a matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, to whom I am grateful.  His office is full of useful information.</p>  <p>  I tabled my question to the Minister for Education and Skills in accordance with normal procedures.  Is he satisfied that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes?  My constituency is in the cockpit of the changes.  It is experiencing a huge increase in population which will start to filter into west Dublin, south east Meath, north Kildare, Fingal and other parts of the country.  From my experience, I am not convinced that the Department is up to speed and I want to know what in general the Minister is doing about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00600"><p>It is a valid question for the Deputy to raise.  Ireland has experienced a significant bulge in pupil enrolments in schools.  We have seen significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places, which puts a high demand on the Department's capital budgets.  Since 2011 there have been 340 major school projects and over 120,000 new and replacement places have been provided.</p>  <p>  My Department's capital programme continues to address the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing school population.  To meet this demographic challenge, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme for the period 2016 to 2021 details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process.  The programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  We are building more schools and providing more school places than ever before.  This reflects the priority which the Government is giving to education.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  It uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where there will be pressure to provide school places across the country.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources. </p>  <p>  The nationwide demographic exercises involving all school planning areas at primary and post-primary level which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future are ongoing.  My Department is factoring in the demographic exercises critical updated data, including updated enrolment data and up-to-date information on additional residential development from local authorities.  The provisional 2017-18 enrolment data have recently been made available and provide an important update on the available information which will inform the outcome of the demographic exercises.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the review will be announced in the coming weeks.  In addition, my Department is included in the prescribed bodies to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00700"><p>I am glad that a review is taking place.  I have raised this issue previously in the D&aacute;il.  I have met officials at my request, meetings the Minister organised, to explain my concerns.  What is happening in my constituency in Dunshaughlin and Ashbourne, in particular - I suspect it is also happening in other constituencies - is that houses are being built that are not starter homes.  They are not for families starting off, rather they are for ready-made families, as a predecessor of mine on the education side in my party described them.  They are for families with grown up children who are moving to Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin, in particular.  In all my years as a Deputy, until the past few years, I never had to deal with an educational welfare officer to find a school place for a child.  Unfortunately, this is now a regular feature of my constituency work in Ashbourne, in particular.  It is not fair.  Families who have moved into the area find that there is not a single school place available if they have a child attending first, third or fifth class, despite welcome improvements in schools infrastructure delivery.  I am told by my colleagues in Fingal and Kildare that, notwithstanding further developments, the Department is already behind in providing new designated buildings.  I am very concerned about this issue.  We should not have to ring an educational welfare officer to find a school place for a child.  That is the last thing we should need to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A00900"><p>I accept the Deputy's point that patterns of development are changing and that, as a result, the models used to predict growth in the numbers of children in accordance with new settlements have to factor this in.  We liaise very closely with the local authorities which have on-the-ground information.  We also track child benefit payments data and pick up data for preschool children as quickly as possible.  We use every data source we can track, be it social welfare, local authority or another source.  I can give the Deputy information on them.  It is a forecasting exercise which is always prone to error, but the Department is using all of the geographical based information data on which the Central Statistics Office and others can lay their hands to improve the forecasting model.  As I said, if there are particular needs, there are systems in place to provide additional school places on a quicker basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100003#A01000"><p>The educational welfare service of Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs urgently needs to be brought within the Minister's Department.  Educational welfare officers are finding issues on the ground; they are definitely finding them in Ashbourne, as they will tell the Minister.  They are receiving representations from my clinic and I am sure from those of the Minister's colleagues.  The service should be within the Minister's Department in order that it would know first-hand from the individuals in question where the critical points were and why a first class or a third class in a school was full.  In general, there may not yet be a problem in finding places in junior infant classes in some cases.  As I said, the houses being built are four-bedroom detached dwellings in many cases.  This presents a real problem.  The Department has a long history in that regard and knows all about this problem.  It had to deal with a crisis in Laytown, which was the first political issue on which I worked just before I was elected to the D&aacute;il with the late Deputy Shane McEntee.  The issues that arose there appear to be beginning to arise again elsewhere and I am disappointed that the Department does not seem to have learned the lessons.  That crisis is seared in my memory and I will certainly do all in my power to prevent such an issue from ever arising again.</p></speech>

Most of them were in areas where we had identified a need.  Of course, the Department has to have a planning process and we rely on the local authorities and other agencies to supply us with data.  The data we use come from the CSO, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Tusla, as well as our own enrolments databases.  I will ensure the Department factors in any information coming from agencies such as Tusla that may not be available in the forecasting model.</p></speech>

This uses information that we can track from any sources that can help refine the process.</p></speech>

These units are not available within a reasonable geographic distance for students.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00500"><p>Ensuring that children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for this Government.  Since 2011 we have provided 12,000 extra pupils with special needs assistant, SNA, support.  The investment has been very substantial.  There have been 3,545 additional SNAs since 2011, over 2,000 in the last two years.  There have been 3,660 additional resource teachers, 1,600 of which have been recruited in the past two years.  In terms of special classes, which I know the Deputy is concerned about, there have been an additional 712 of those since 2011.  That represents a more than doubling of the amount of special class, including 277 new classes in the past two years.  Another 180 are planned for this September.</p>  <p>  The Department is extending major investment to meet the very needs the Deputy brings up, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, advises me that we are meeting those needs.</p>  <p>  Most children with special education needs attend mainstream class, but some require the environment of a special class. This decision is based on a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, SENOs, in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area, for example where a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, Deputy Thomas Byrne and others have urged at Committee Stage that we would introduce a provision, which I am now having drafted, which would give the NCSE the power to designate a school to open a special class, should that prove necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00600"><p>I am concerned that the NCSE is saying it is meeting the requirements.  Unfortunately it is not.  I am not sure where it is getting its figures from, but in my constituency alone in the last number of months I have dealt with three cases of children who are due to start school in September and who have no school place.  Starting school is a major step in anybody's life, but if a person has an additional need and does not know what school he or she will attend it is difficult.  In some situations parents are being told that there is a school an hour or an hour and a half away and that transport will be provided.  In that instance a child of five is being asked to get on a bus for an hour and a half before he or she even starts school.  A few weeks into that sort of system they are going to be so exhausted that they will not be able to learn, let alone reach their full potential.  There are 24 ASD units throughout Carlow and Kilkenny at primary level and 16 at post primary level.  They only cater for six children each, so that is a total of 144 in primary school and 96 at post-primary.  It is not adequate, certainly in my constituency.  Perhaps the NCSE is saying that it is adequate in its eyes, but I invite it to come down to our constituency and visit the schools and parents who are struggling.  What are we supposed to tell them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00700"><p>We are establishing these special units at a very rapid pace.  There are 180 planned for next September.  To have a special class the NCSE must ensure that there are enough children so that it will be a sustainable class.  It has to consider present and future need.  While it will not always be possible to provide an ASD unit in the child's own school for that reason the NCSE has informed the Department that it is generally satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class places at primary level to meet existing demand.  The NCSE and my Department work closely together to address the issues of provision that arise from time to time at local level.  These issues arise in my constituency as well.</p>  <p>  Children with special education needs are eligible for school transport.  In the event that these children have to move away from their local school their transport requirements will be met.  That has been significantly expanded, so that 2,000 more children with special needs have availed of school transport in the last number of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00800"><p>I understand that the children are eligible for school transport, but it is not good enough that we are asking a five year old child to get on a bus at 7.30 a.m. so that he or she can be in school for 9 a.m.  The child in that instance would be awake for over an hour and a half before they even get to school and begin to learn.  That is not an adequate way to learn.  That child is not going to do well.  He or she is going to end up completely exhausted and will miss days from school.  I would ask that the Minister inquire of the NCSE, if it is insisting that there are adequate spaces, whether it will look into provision in Carlow-Kilkenny and tell us why there are so many children who are unable to get a place in an ASD unit.  In some cases a place is not available even an hour or an hour and a half away.  There have been a large number of cases in the last few months where parents have been told that schools just do not have the space in September.  It is now February, and parents do not know where their children will be going to school in September.  That is completely unfair.  Every other child who does not have an additional need who is starting school will know either this month or next month when they will start school.  There will be the usual meetings with the school concerning being a new student and the whole big step of starting school.  These other children are simply being left behind because they have an additional need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100004#B00900"><p>It is important to say that two thirds of children with special needs are accommodated in a mainstream class.  Not every child needs to be considered for a special unit.  A special unit is a six-child unit, with a teacher of its own and two SNAs.  Its own space has to be developed.  Unfortunately we cannot guarantee that will be available in every single local school.  Where the need is established in an area we work with the schools to establish that class as conveniently as possible to the children who have the need.  That requires school transport for some children in some cases.  The NCSE tries to solve these problems in as practical a way as possible by working with the schools.  We are taking this additional step of giving the power to direct, if necessary, to the NCSE.  By and large we have not found that schools are unsupportive of these units.  In fact, many schools are really keen to see the development of those units in their areas.</p>  <p>  It is expanding very rapidly.  We are matching the need, as conveniently as we can, to the parents.  I will ask that the NCSE have a look at Carlow-Kilkenny.</p></speech>

There is a real technological divide between schools happening at the moment.  In many cases it is an urban-rural divide, and in some cases it is putting the future of rural schools at risk because they do not have access to broadband.  Ludicrous situations are arising, as is also the case for many rural dwellers, where the mainline Eir broadband is coming within a few feet or metres of particular schools.  Sometimes the Eir broadband is just up the road but it cannot be provided to the schools.  What does the Minister propose to do about this?</p></reply>

Deputy Byrne has outlined why that is important.  It is essential to embed technologies for teaching and learning and for the implementation of new subjects.  My Department spends some &euro;15 million per year on the provision of internet connectivity.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided.</p>  <p>  A programme to roll out broadband to post-primary schools was started in 2012, at a time when virtually no school had speeds of over 30Mbp/s.  By the end of 2015, all 735 post-primary schools and some 58 special schools had speeds of 100Mbp/s.</p>  <p>  In the case of primary schools, by the end of 2017, 1,046 schools were upgraded to speeds of 30Mbp/s plus, the standard established under the national broadband plan.  It is anticipated that the infrastructure to be made available through Eir's 300K rural deployment commitment will reach 700 to 800 schools by the end of 2018. </p><p>This infrastructure will allow for speeds of at least 30 Mbps, if not more, and my Department will upgrade the service to those schools as soon as possible on delivery of the infrastructure.</p> <p> The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in my Department's digital strategy.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to advise on how this can be best achieved while having regard to other developments in State policy and the implementation of the Government's national broadband plan, its associated intervention strategy and provision offered by the industry.  Extensive training supports are available to schools to help in their planning and engagement with technology for teaching and learning.</p></speech>

Eir has a strategy for its own rural network and, before yesterday, apparently had a strategy for the rest of the rural network.  I posted on Facebook yesterday, for my constituents, that Eir had pulled out of the national broadband plan.  I view that as a disaster, as I am sure everybody does, but the reaction from members of the public was a little different.  They have had such bad experiences with Eir, in various guises, over recent years that they are somewhat glad it is out of the process because they do not have confidence in it.  When the Minister says that Eir will deliver these schools by the end of the year, it is almost passing the buck to a company that, let us be honest, has shown itself to be unreliable in the provision of broadband in rural areas.  Yesterday was the pinnacle of that.  I am very concerned that the answer to schools' broadband provision is Eir.  The Department needs a far more comprehensive strategy involving the Department and other technologies that might be available.  The Department should consider that urgently.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the elements of putting this in place will partly come from commercial roll-out and Eir and others are doing that.  It will partly come from the national broadband plan as well, and there are others that will have to be resolved in other ways.  We are working in all three channels, as it were.  We cannot ignore that where it is commercially viable for a company to roll it out, and Eir is a significant player and its plan envisages another 700 to 800 this year, that is clearly an opportunity for us to deliver to our primary schools.  However, it is not the sole way of resolving the remaining areas we must address.  Each year my Department seeks to plan the continuing roll-out.  I share the Deputy's concern that we do this as quickly as possible.  I understand the national broadband plan has the target of 2022 to complete the roll-out.  If that could be achieved it would be the real backbone for addressing the rural disadvantage about which the Deputy is concerned.</p></speech>

That is the truth.  Parents will look askance at schools that cannot provide the full educational experience to their students.  As I said previously, the centre point of the strategy appears to be Eir.  Eir is a dead duck.  If it rolls out what it says it will in rural areas, aside from the national broadband plan which it has dropped like a hot potato, it may work out, but it is not acceptable for the Department of Education and Skills to put its eggs in the basket of a private operator that has proved itself to be unreliable in the provision of broadband, and not just in rural areas.  I am seeking a much more comprehensive strategy.  After the debacle that occurred yesterday, which is tragic for broadband in rural areas, perhaps it is time for the Department to acknowledge that it must look at this again, as it is a clear and present threat to our rural schools.</p></speech>

However, Eir has a plan and it reiterated yesterday that it would deliver that plan even though it is pulling back from the national broadband plan.  It would be short-sighted of the Department to suggest that Eir's potential to fill a significant gap should be shunned in some way.  We will work with any commercial provider that proves capable of delivering.  I am keen to have this move as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who will probably be answering questions later in the House, does not foresee delay in the roll-out of the national broadband strategy as a result of the decision by Eir, so we will continue to work with all parties and use the best available information to support our programme of investment.</p></speech>

The grant most recently issued to all primary schools last December in respect of the school year 2017-18.  The payment of the minor works grant is not confined to any particular date and can be issued during any month of the school year.  For the 2002-03 school year, part of the grant was paid in May 2003 with the balance paid in October 2003.</p>  <p>  With regard to the minor works grant for 2018-19, it is intended that the grant will issue not later than January 2019.  The capital allocation for the school sector in 2018 will be expended primarily on large-scale projects, the additional accommodation scheme and site acquisitions.  The priority remains to have sufficient school places available for the start of the school year next September.</p>  <p>  I am confident that outlining the position regarding the minor works grant for 2018-19 gives certainty to schools so they can plan accordingly for the infrastructure works specified in the minor works grant circular that they intend to undertake.  My Department recognises the importance of the minor works grant and there are no plans in place either to withdraw or reduce it.  As part of our longer-term infrastructural planning, the Department will explore whether it will be possible to give greater certainty to primary schools about the payment of the minor works grant, taking account of the Government's ten-year public capital investment plan which is under development.</p></reply>

I agree with the Minister that the scheme is necessary.  However, it is not just for minor works now.  It is for physically trying to keep the schools standing with some modicum of respectability for the staff and the pupils.  They are being educated in buildings that are creaking and damp and often have many other problems such as with the roof or the heating.  There were issues with heating in some schools recently that the minor works grant would not even cover.  The grant is really a sticking plaster for many schools.  However, I accept the Minister's statement that the grants for this year will be paid not later than January 2019.  My main worry is if there is enough funding available and whether there will be cutbacks to the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that because it is vital.  As I said, the scheme is a sticking plaster but it is vital for principals, boards of management and parent councils to have that avenue to get some funding.  They must fundraise for a huge amount of the rest.</p></speech>

I believe what we have worked out here is a satisfactory arrangement.  We recognise that 2018 will be a difficult year because there are so many demands on the scheme.  We made the payment before the end of last year and we have given schools advance notice that the next payment will be in January 2019.  That allows us to manage our flow of money and it gives schools certainty.  As the Deputy said, this has become an expectation and a need for schools, so over the coming years I will seek to give a map upon which people can plan.</p></speech>

Now he says he will pay it by January 2019.  However, is there sufficient funding to meet the demand that will arise?  The Minister was unsure in the House some months ago.  He said it himself.  It was not another Minister answering for him.  I believe what the Minister says himself.</p><p>The concern is that people are going to put in applications.  The Minister said they would be paid by January 2019, which is good, but will they all get over the wire?  These schools are looking for a very necessary few bob to ease the pressure on the parents, the boards of management and the parents councils' fundraising efforts in order to keep the schools open - literally to keep the lights on, fix collapsed ceilings and deal with dampness, accidental damage or, God forbid, storm damage.  This grant is all they have.  The minor works scheme is paltry enough so I need to know, on behalf of the schools in Tipperary, that there will be enough in the scheme if they apply.</p></speech>

This is something we pay on the basis of capitation, and it is so much per child and so much per school according to a formula.  What I am saying very clearly is that we paid it before Christmas and we will pay it again on the same basis in January 2019.  We will be paying it for each school year and we will continue to pay it.  There are not pressures on the resources and we are making provision for that payment.  We can map this.  As the Deputy said, it has become an area where schools need money, so we will map that into the future in line with other longer-term planning.</p></speech>

I am pleased that, under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I negotiated a programme of pay restoration with the teacher unions.  Through this process, a 15% to 22% pay increase was negotiated for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for newer teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and, from 1 October 2020, will be &euro;37,692.  This is a very competitive graduate salary, as the CSO reports today have confirmed.</p>  <p>  I have successfully hired over 5,000 extra teachers in the last two years.  We are hiring more teachers than at any other point in the State's history.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross-sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The public service stability agreement 2018-20 contains a commitment to consider the issue of newly qualified teacher pay within 12 months of the agreement&rsquo;s commencement and that process has started.  Also, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will lay a report before the Oireachtas on the cost of, and a plan for dealing with, pay equalisation for new entrants within three months of the passing of the Act.</p>  <p>  On the issue of teacher supply, the Deputy may wish to note that I have already announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short-term vacancies.</p></speech>

That means the number of applicants is now substantially less than half of what it was five years ago - in fact, there has been a collapse of 62% over that period.  It is clear that a career as a teacher no longer has the attraction it had even five years ago.  Clearly, the combination of salary scale, conditions of service and career prospects are deficient.  This is exacerbated by the travesty of paying new entrants at a lower salary scale and providing a pension scheme which is significantly inferior to that enjoyed by their longer-serving colleagues.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister, as a first step, equalise the pay scales of new entrants with their colleagues?  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, which represents 2,800 schools, found that 90% of principals are having difficulties finding qualified or substitute teachers.</p></speech>

However, the number graduating from the programme has not.  By contrast, the undergraduate programme is massively oversubscribed.  There are more than 5,000 seeking to join the undergraduate programme, for which there are only 500 places, and I announced last week that I plan to double the number of places on that undergraduate programme.  Of course, that has the advantage in financial terms that a master's fee does not have to be paid for people going that route.  I have also announced that I plan to have quotas for particular subject areas where, as Deputies have pointed out, there is tightness and we need to have ambition, for example, the STEM programme and the foreign languages programme.  I am establishing a teachers supply steering group which will work with all of the stakeholders to deliver these programmes.  I made immediate changes in terms of the career break and the period that people could work on a career break.  I have advised schools that they should not give a career break unless they can, as the circular requires, be assured it is in the best interests of children in the school and that they can fill the position vacated.</p></speech>

The ETBs, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the joint managerial bodies, the trade unions and everybody else have acknowledged there is a significant crisis in recruitment and retention of teachers and it is getting worse.  The suggestion that restricting career breaks would help is not correct and would, in fact, worsen the situation and mean we have teachers emigrating.</p>  <p>  We must continue to have the most able people teaching our children.  The continuation of current Government policy will do lasting damage to the education system.  Bad and all as the situation is now, official documents and official statistics show that, at second level alone, there will be an additional 85,000 students by 2025, which will require an additional 4,000 teachers.</p></speech>

There is the issue of substitution and the issue of subject areas, which I am addressing, and I am also planning to double the number of undergraduate places for teaching.  Those are very solid responses to needs that we all acknowledge.  It is worth pointing out to the Deputy that, back in 2014, before I made the improvements in pay that we negotiated with the unions, teachers were the second-highest paid graduates, second only to ICT workers.</p><p>We have made improvements since then and we have a process in place under the pay negotiations where the remaining issues of the trade unions are being discussed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his advisers with a view to resolving those issues over time.  There is a process in place which the Deputy should acknowledge.  We are making real efforts to establish a balanced response to the needs of teachers which are, of course, important, as well as the needs of pupils.  We have heard about the many challenges we must meet in regard to pupils who we must also treat equitably.</p></speech>

Current enrolment stands at 202 pupils with a current staffing of one principal plus eight mainstream teaching posts and three special education support teachers.  The site for the school is quite restricted and is bounded by Dominick Street Lower to the front, Dominick Place to the rear and No. 20 Dominick Street to the north which is a protected structure.</p>  <p>  The original design brief for this project was for an eight-classroom primary school and a team to design this project was appointed by open competition in December 2012.  However, due to increasing enrolments, the brief increased to a 16-classroom school.  The project has been designed up to stage 2A - developed design - as an eight-classroom primary school by this design team with a design indication option of how a 16-classroom school could be fitted into this restrictive site.  In April of last year, the services of this design team were terminated by mutual agreement and it became necessary to commence the tender process to appoint a new design team to complete fully a stage 2A, developed-design report for the 16-classroom school.  This process is nearing completion, letters of intent have issued to each of the disciplines and once final documentation checks are completed in full, my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities to advise them as to the next steps in the process.  The progression of this project through architectural planning and into construction will be dealt with as part of my Department's schools building programme 2016 to 2021.</p></speech>

The Minister set out those details then.  I acknowledge the work the school and the Department have done.  The patron, trustees, board of management, parents' council and teachers have done a great deal of extra work to progress the project since the decision was taken to double the size of the school.  As to the design, will there be enough open space for the children given the restricted site?  Are we clear on that given the importance of an open playing space for children?  Can the Minister provide a realistic timeframe going forward?  That is what I really want to get today.  The school has been in temporary accommodation for 14 years.  Does the Minister have any idea of when the tendering process will be completed and the next stage will commence?</p></speech>

It is not possible for me to forecast when various stages will complete.  As the Deputy said, this started as a plan for an eight-teacher school, but that changed.  Changes of that nature are beyond my capacity to predict and it would be very hazardous for me to suggest a completion date.  The Department will work with the school and the design team.  As to the open space, I have no information.  I presume the design team has worked with the school to ensure its needs are met, but I do not have information on the detailed brief that has been drawn up.</p></speech>

The Department provides a grant towards that temporary accommodation for the school every year and one must think about what that money could be used to achieve if the school moved to a permanent site.  I ask the Minister to ensure this stays on the agenda and for real progress for teachers and pupils in 2018.  As it stands, they are in unsuitable accommodation which is unfair to the staff and the children and is costing the Department money.</p></speech>

It is, of course, necessary to use temporary accommodation at times.  In an ideal world we would not be doing it, but schools grow at different paces and one has to be flexible.  Temporary accommodation is a necessary way to deliver a consistent programme over time, but I take the Deputy's point and hopefully we can make good progress on the project.</p></speech>

In accordance with the memorandum of understanding, my Department continues to work with officials in Fingal County Council to identify and acquire school sites and this process is ongoing.  A new site has recently been procured in Mooretown, Swords, and a building project is planned which will provide permanent accommodation for Swords Community College in due course.  I am not in a position to provide further details at this time in respect of the schools in Malahide-Portmarnock due to the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the provision of sites for schools is a priority for the Department.  My Department is in communication with the respective patron bodies in respect of interim accommodation arrangements pending delivery of permanent accommodation.</p></speech>

While that might not seem too far if one is outside Dublin, it is a very significant distance in an urban environment, in particular given traffic on the Malahide Road.  It is also accommodated in an unsuitable facility which is in effect a former third-level agricultural college.  We are expending considerable moneys to facilitate the school there.  The difficulty is that there is considerable demand for that particular school which is growing at a significant rate.  However, it is growing in the wrong community and it is not serving the community for which it was designated.</p>  <p>  The secondary school has a school principal but no school building.  It was supposed to open last year.  While I appreciate the sensitivities around land acquisition, the Mooretown site was identified by myself and other councillors over a decade ago, but we are no further along the road of identifying a site that can be acquired in the Malahide-Portmarnock community area.  I appreciate that the Department has particular budgetary constraints but if we designate an area for a non-denominational school, we have to back it up with the purchase of a site.  I cannot understand how we are no further along three years later with the secondary school delayed and no site for the primary school.</p></speech>

The Malahide-Portmarnock Educate Together primary school has six classes accommodated in the Teagasc building in Kinsealy.</p><p>There was an evaluation of sites but they ultimately proved unviable.  A potential permanent site has been identified and is being progressed in respect of the secondary school.  In both cases the Department must work with others to bring the project ashore.  That is what is being done.  It is working with Fingal and the interests concerned to try to meet this demand.  It is a difficult area, and this is something we are finding in the city area where potential sites are scarce and difficult to come by but the Department is actively working on the procurement of sites for the two schools.</p></speech>

I commend the work and the commitment that is there but according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, we have significant growth in the two communities and the demand for schooling places is now critical in Malahide and Portmarnock, especially at second level.  There is a commitment to deliver a new school for Portmarnock by way of a new school building for Portmarnock community school but that commitment must be delivered on now.  We identified Malahide-Portmarnock as requiring a non-denominational school.  The Department of Education and Skills did that identification.  That process began in 2012 and now, in 2018, we still do not have a site.  I welcome the fact that the school is operational.  We have a significant difficulty with secondary education.

We have two Educate Together schools designated for the general community.  Should they not share a site?

I understand that separate sites are identified for these two schools that are being progressed and I shudder to suggest that we should scrap the progress that has been made and come up with another approach.  I fear that would delay the project.  I do not have the detailed knowledge of the issues being negotiated for the very reason that they are commercially sensitive and are being negotiated with the individuals.  My knowledge is that two sites are being progressed and the Department is working in good faith to bring those to conclusion.  I will not suggest that we pull back on what is in progress unless the patron body makes a clear case to the Department that it would improve delivery.

We are hiring more teachers than at any other time in the State's history.  As the Deputy has indicated, issues have arisen.  The provisions of the career break scheme are set out in chapter eight, Terms and Conditions of Employment for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A career break is period of special leave and the main objectives of this scheme is for employers, wherever possible, to facilitate applicants in the areas of personal development, voluntary service overseas, to accompany a spouse or partner on a diplomatic or military posting, for education, public representation, child care or dependent care, and self-employment.</p>  <p>  In response to reported difficulties by schools with regard to recruiting substitute teachers, my Department issued notification on 26 January that it was suspending the restrictions regarding substitution limits for those on a career break for the current school year.  Prior to this decision the limits were 90 days in primary schools and 300 hours in post primary schools.  The notification also reminded employers that &ldquo;in considering applications for career breaks, the welfare and educational needs of the pupils shall take precedence over all other considerations and accordingly, must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers".  I understand from representations received that suspending the restrictions as outlined will provide immediate assistance to some schools finding it difficult to recruit qualified substitute teachers.</p></reply>

I have spoken to him about this on foot of my experience as chair of a board of management and it is a situation which other schools are also facing.  Boards are in a difficult position.  They want to be flexible with teachers who come to the board seeking a career break but it has been extremely difficult.  Today is the deadline for applications for this year.  I know that there will be boards which will dread that first meeting in February where these decisions will have to be made.  What the Minister has said here is very clear.  Time will tell if suspending those restrictions will have the effect that the Minister says it will have.  There are so many demands on boards of management, which are voluntary.  This directive and the Minister's input could be very helpful in resolving the inordinate number of career break requests that some schools are getting.</p></speech>

Its purposes are set out in the answer I just gave.  The scheme is not for purposes such as switching career.  The obligation is on the board of management to decide on the matter.  I am happy to leave the arrangement where it is, namely, with the decision made at local level, but the boards must bear in mind the needs of the children and the boards' capacity to replace the teacher.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the problem regarding substitution, people on career break can be part of a solution.  There are also significant number, in fact a majority, of teachers who are retiring under the age of 60 years.  If they remain registered, they can provide substitution hours.  Student teachers in their final year of study can be considered for substitution.  We are looking at all sources of supply.  I have established a teaching supply group to monitor other possible actions.</p></speech>

That has also been driving the request for career breaks.</p>  <p>  On the Teaching Council and registration, I know of teachers who retired under the age of 60 years whose registration with the Teaching Council lapsed, or in some cases they may not have thought they would return to the classroom.  The Teaching Council could be encouraged to speed up the process, particularly in the cases of teachers who have been registered in the past but let it lapse because they did not think they would come back to teaching but now there is a need for them to return. </p></speech>

The difficulty with the question of career break is that if someone has a permanent post and they leave, it can only be filled with a temporary post, which is less attractive for the school and the teacher.  Career breaks need to be thought out by the school for that reason.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there are pressures in housing and so on, but we are trying to manage this.  The difficulty arises in part because we are recruiting such a high number of posts.  We are recruiting 5,000 teachers in two years, which is a significant rate of recruitment.  It might have been the case that there were more teachers who were interested in part-time posts who now have access to full-time posts.  That also changes the environment.  There are several issues that must be monitored.  I am also making changes in initial education to try to improve the supply.</p></speech>

This has created serious difficulties for many families.  This is a particular issue in more remote parts of rural Ireland.

He has met Deputies who have suggestions and concerns.  I suppose I need to outline the position.  It is a significant operation.  It is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Some 115,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in 4,500 vehicles to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country each day.  These vehicles cover approximately 100 million km each year.  This service was provided at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  I think the relevant distance at primary level is 3.2 km and at secondary level is 4.8 km.  It is important to note that all eligible children are accommodated under the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments in the programme for Government, a review of the concessionary charges and rules element of the school transport scheme has been undertaken.  The review, which was published in December 2016, made recommendations on the charges and the rules elements of the concessionary school transport scheme.  The recommended course of action in respect of the charges for concessionary school transport was to continue with the current policy of imposing charges in respect of those in receipt of concessionary places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.  The report also recommended that the number of concessionary places should be reduced in line with the rules introduced in 2012 on a phased basis.  Previous plans to advance this option were put on hold, pending the completion of the review.  After considering the review and discussing the matter with the cross-party working group which was established to feed into the review, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, decided there should be no planned programme of downsizing in the coming years, other than in line with normal operational decisions under the current scheme.  The terms of the school transport scheme are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been very forthcoming and receptive to meetings with all of us.  He indicated in response to a Topical Issue I raised in this Chamber that a small amount of additional money would enable him to provide a better service to many people.  The Minister has quite rightly pointed out that significant resources are invested in the school transport scheme, which is particularly important in rural Ireland.  We can talk about introducing various schemes with the aim of regenerating rural Ireland, but if we do not have a satisfactory school transport scheme there will be a substantial deficit in rural Ireland.  Everyone who has the privilege of representing a rural constituency - my colleagues, Deputies Niall Collins and Eugene Murphy, represent constituencies that are much like my constituency - knows that many families decide to set up homes in rural parishes on the basis of access to schools and availability of transport to primary and secondary schools.  I appreciate that there will always be difficulties in any overall general scheme that is based on boundaries.  There needs to be some flexibility in decision-making at local level.  As we all know, changes in the old catchment areas that were assigned to schools that closed in the past can mean that rural communities fall into different towns or villages.  In cases in which older siblings went to certain post-primary centres, flexibility is needed to ensure younger siblings are not denied the transport services that were available to other family members.  If those services are not available, it will impose an additional cost burden on families.</p></speech>

If we want the rules to apply nationally on an equitable and fair basis, we need to ensure they apply in every community.  The rules cannot differ from one community to another.  The Deputy is looking for a different rule to apply in his area because of its special circumstances.  The problem is that a scheme cannot be run on that basis.  We have rules and criteria relating to the distance from the school and the question of whether it is the nearest school.  Children have been accommodated in circumstances in which there were places on local buses.  They were always accommodated on the basis that it was not being done as of right.  The Deputy is suggesting that we should create a right for such children.  That would be an entirely new rule and it would have to be applied everywhere.  Many better brains than my brain have tried to grapple with what the Deputy is saying, but they have not been able to move away from the sort of rules-based approach that guarantees equity to every community.</p></speech>

I said that additional costs should not be imposed on a family that has had a traditional pattern of attendance at a post-primary centre in the event that the level of school transport service that was made available to older siblings in that family is denied to a younger sibling who is about to enter secondary school.  In recent years, the use of Google maps when people have been applying for school transport online has resulted in distances being measured using roads that are not capable of carrying motor cars or school transport buses.  It is that context that I am talking about local flexibility and local knowledge.  I fully appreciate that a scheme cannot be designed to suit every family.  We should have flexibility.  Past patterns of attendance should be taken into account.  That washes out of the system anyway as the years go on.  By and large, all the difficulties being encountered by specific families, with which all of us have dealt, will be ironed out within a few years.  I remind the Minister that many of the costs associated with the concessionary transport scheme are being met by families that are under financial pressure.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to consider the point that a little modern imagination should be used when the rules are being defined at local level.  It has been shown that it is possible for this to be done without breaching the national rules.  As Deputy Smith has said, a precise measurement can sometimes be achieved by satellite but, depending on the circumstances, this is sometimes not possible.  I would like this to be looked at along the lines mentioned by Deputy Smith.  Such an approach would be beneficial in reaching a solution that removes much of the angst in a local area without any breaching of rules.</p></speech>

It has doubled to 27,000 in the last four years.  The core number of eligible pupils who always get their transport delivered is 77,000.  As I understand it, the problem that has arisen is that some people who have been receiving concessionary transport feel that they and their siblings should have an entitlement on the basis that a pattern has been established.  That is where problems arise.  I can understand exactly what the Deputies are saying.  I have not seen a solution that involves allocating the existing budget of &euro;190 million in a different way that is seen to be fair to all communities and treats all communities in an equitable way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has grappled with this difficulty, as others did before him.  I do not have a solution I can offer to the Deputies.  The Minister of State is always open to considering suggestions and evaluating them with the officials concerned.</p></speech>

The Department of Health has established an intra-departmental group, chaired by the chief medical officer, to address the ancillary recommendations of the joint committee.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will engage with the Department of Health on this ancillary recommendation.</p>  <p>  Access to sexual health and relationships education is an important right for students.  Schools have a responsibility to provide for it, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.  However, it is important to note that the ethos of the school must not preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge set out in the curriculum.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, which includes relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and the junior cycle.  RSE is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle.  My Department has set out the content of each of the programmes in the SPHE and RSE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the SPHE curriculum at primary level will undergo a review by the NCCA as part of the ongoing review of the curriculum.  A review of the curriculum at senior cycle is also under way and the SPHE programme at that level will be considered.  The reviews will include the views of all of the education partners, recent research outcomes, societal and cultural changes, and existing policies and teaching materials.  SPHE and RSE form integral parts of the new well-being area of learning at junior cycle.</p></speech>

My key concern is about impartiality and the provision of factual information.  The religious ethos of the majority of schools is preventing young people from receiving vital information that will allow them to make choices in life.  There seem to be more laws to protect the rights of the institution over those of the young person.  I sent a question to the Minister on 18 January on RSE being delivered by Accord, a Catholic organisation that does not, for example, deal with same-sex couples in marriage counselling services, despite the outcome of a massive referendum.  Its representatives are going into hundreds of schools, including ETB schools which do not have a Catholic ethos; therefore, young people who are LGBT are not receiving what should be reflected in their lives.</p></speech>

In 2017 it provided contextualised school-based supports for 3,084 primary and 2,100 post-primary teachers.  There is investment by the Department to make sure the teachers who deliver the programme have the skills to do so.  That was just one year of the programme's activities.  As I emphasised in my initial reply, there are no options in the delivery of the programme.  Schools cannot opt out of certain parts of the sexuality education programme being delivered.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the use of outside organisations, there are very clear guidelines from the Department which are included in circulars to primary and post-primary schools.  They state that where an outside speaker is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school, that he and or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it, that it is the responsibility of the school to ensure outside speakers are aware of the school policy and that the full content of the curriculum is delivered.  It is not envisaged that outside providers will deliver the core curriculum in this area, although they can be a supplement to it.</p></speech>

In 2016 Accord delivered courses in 53 secondary schools and all 347 Catholic primary schools in Dublin.  ETB schools also avail of its services.  In response to a related question I sent to the Minister yesterday, he stated he would review the funding of the Meitheal and Ember programmes because even though they were not in the area of RSE, they were related to student self-esteem and development.  The programmes have been receiving an endowment from the State, even though they are denominational and only deal with young people who are Catholic.  We also find that boys' schools do not provide sex education as much as girls' schools.  Girls are meant to be the gatekeepers when it comes to sexuality.  There is an ethos which is based on waiting until the time is right; it is not an all-encompassing view of sexuality but tends to be about watching out for this and not doing it.  There is a clear link between quality sex education and lower levels of crisis pregnancies.  Surely that is something in which there should be an interest in developing.</p></speech>

It expressed concerns about the period during which the programme was delivered and the fact that it could be delivered as part of religious education.  As the Department has made clear, schools do not have the option of not delivering the full curriculum.  The Deputy and the committee are right - we need to have a look at the programme and that is what the committee will do.  It made the comment that many teachers were not comfortable teaching RSE and that, therefore, it was left to a minority of teachers or outsourced to an agency.  Clearly, this needs to be looked at.  As I stated, agencies cannot be used to provide the entire programme.  While agencies can deliver part of it, the school must have a comprehensive programme to deliver it.  Of course, the inspectorate will have to be satisfied that that is the case.  These are important points, points the group will examine and that we will take seriously.  I wanted to give the Deputy the background to the existing policies and what supports were available for schools to ensure the programme was delivered properly.</p></speech>

All statutory approvals have been secured.  The stage 2b submission has been reviewed by the Department and comments were issued to the school and its design team in December 2017.  The Department has requested confirmation from the design team that it will carry out one final review of all of its tender documentation to ensure compliance with departmental requirements.  The design team has been requested to submit written confirmation from each design team member, including the project supervisor design process, PSDP, that it has completed the review and is satisfied that the tender documents are complete, correct and in compliance with departmental requirements and the amended building control regulations on tender documentation.  On receipt of the requested confirmations, the Department will revert to the school on the further progression of the project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the funding pressures on the capital programme and the need to focus limited funding on the provision of additional school places to cater for demographic demands.  The Department is reviewing its programme for capital expenditure in 2018 and into 2019.  Building projects, including St. Mary's national school, will be considered in that context.  Officials from the Department will shortly be in contact with the school about a timeframe for progression of the project.</p></speech>

That is not good enough and I must make a political charge.  It appears, in the case of this and many other schools, that there is deliberate procrastination at all stages.</p><p>The Minister refers to funding and capital expenditure.  Bringing the project to a stage at which the Minister can go to tender with it will not cost anything.  The school has 447 pupils, of whom 157, or 35%, are permanently based in prefabs.  They will have passed through the system before we receive the necessary approval.  There is running water in only four classrooms.  The main building was built in 1958 and extended later.  The planning period for the new school had expired and we had to seek a further duration of five years.  I am worried because we can do this only once.  Therefore, I implore the Minister to issue a political directive to the Department to move on the project as quickly as possible to allow it to go tender later this year.</p></speech>

However, it needs to be satisfied that the tender process is robust and that has been done.  It then has to be satisfied, as it releases projects to tender, that it is in accordance with the funding available.  It has to plan and manage the process as best as possible.  I agree that it would be best to give schools a roadmap to show how this occurs.  The Department is trying to improve in that area in order that schools understand the road ahead.  I acknowledge the difficulty highlighted by the Deputy and will talk to the officials to see if communication with the school can be improved.</p></speech>

I will deal with these projects on another day, but I implore the Minister to ask the officials to move quickly.  The letter from the Department, dated 21 December, should be dealt with without delay.  I realise the Minister is responsible for the country and that Deputies represent counties, but there were school projects further down the list that have been built and the children are in state-of-the-art classrooms.

The policy also seeks to improve the quality of teaching through Irish to ensure existing teachers' Irish language proficiency and pedagogical knowledge, skills and competence will be enhanced to a level that will equip them to deliver high quality Irish medium education.  In that context, the Department has been working with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to develop a request for tenders for the design and delivery of two new Irish medium teacher education programmes, comprising a full-time four-year Irish medium initial teacher education B.Ed. primary teaching programme and a part-time two-year Irish medium M.Ed. postgraduate blended learning programme.  It is expected that the successful tenderers will be announced in the coming weeks.  The M.Ed. programme which will provide up to 30 places annually is due to commence from September 2018, while the B.Ed programme, also with up to 30 places annually, is due to commence from September 2019.</p>  <p>  Also in implementing the policy, the Department made arrangements for the secondment from September 2017 of two additional teaching posts to the M&aacute;istir Gairmi&uacute;il san Oideachas, MGO, programme at the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, which is an Irish medium post-primary ITE programme.  This initiative will allow for an increase in the supply of Irish medium post-primary teachers through a range of measures, including the upskilling of student teachers, outreach, online and blended learning opportunities in the second year of the programme. </p>  <p>  I will shortly announce the establishment of a teacher supply steering group to consider teacher supply issues at primary and post-primary level, including the provision of adequate numbers of teachers in key subject areas such as Irish.</p></reply>

This followed the decision by SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, to withdraw late last year.  Three of the most experienced and established utility companies in the State have opted out of the Government process to provide broadband infrastructure to 542,000 homes and business premises dotted throughout rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the Fine Gael-led Government promised that broadband would be rolled out to every premises in the State by 2016.  That did not happen.  Yesterday's announcement signalled the collapse of the Government's plan.  When negotiating a programme for Government, in which the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, played a key role, the Government indicated that a deal would be done and a contractor would be appointed by June 2017.  That date slipped.  Virtually every date that the Government has set since talking about a national broadband plan has been missed.</p>  <p>  When asked repeatedly in the House to outline the projected contract signing date and the dates on which work would begin and be completed, the Minister dodged the questions and instead waxed lyrical about all of the broadband that was being rolled out throughout Ireland, failing to mention that it was being rolled out by commercial operators based on their commercial decisions and, in many cases, duplicated a pre-existing service in densely populated areas.</p>  <p>  From his former role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste knows the profile and character of rural Ireland.  He knows the kind of people whom he has met on his visits there.  He knows the farming communities, the small communities and the small businesses that support farming and require access to high-speed broadband.  He knows the people who live in rural Ireland and the students who come home at the weekend or every night and need access to broadband in order to pursue their studies.  People living in rural Ireland need access to broadband to conduct their banking and for their basic life pursuits, but they have been continuously deprived of it and have been sold a pup time after time.</p>  <p>  When Vodafone and the ESB pulled out of the process, it should have raised a red flag in the Department concerned, but it did not.  The withdrawal of Eir should have signalled a crisis in the process, but it has not.  Amazingly, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has welcomed the clarity provided by the withdrawal of Eir.  He believes that shovels will be in the ground more quickly and that the project will now be delivered on budget and ahead of schedule.  What cybergalaxy is the Minister living in?  The situation is farcical.  Months of detailed negotiations are still to take place between the remaining bidder and the Government on pricing and technical matters, so there is no guarantee that a deal can be arrived at or if the deal proposed by the Government will remain viable for the 25 years of the contract.  The last thing the 542,000 homes and businesses need is another false dawn or, worse still, a contract that collapses a few years into operation.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed that this infrastructure should have been built and owned by the State.  The Minister rejected that proposition, claiming that it would create significant delays to the project.  The Government put its faith in the market, but the market has turned its back on the Government.  In light of what has happened, will the Government now consider changing the nature of the tender so that the State will take responsibility for building and owning this infrastructure?</p></speech>

Like many Deputies, I grew up on a farm in a rural community.  I know the responsibility the Government has to ensure that people in rural Ireland as well as people in urban centres can access the information and the opportunity that the Internet provides.  They need speed to be able to do that and, by and large, delivering that speed requires fibre, which is exactly what the Government is committed to delivering by effectively State sponsoring the roll-out of broadband to the 500,000 or so households that currently do not have it.  We are going to see that through.</p>  <p>  We have been through a very complex tendering process to get there in terms of finalising a tender that will last for 25 years.  That has been a competitive process.  In many competitive processes, commercial operators pull out for commercial reasons if the processes do not suit them.  That is what has happened here.  We also have another operator - there is now only one left - that has been adamant that it is committed to this process.  It wants to work with the Government on it and believes that it can do this.</p></speech>

We are expecting it to be concluded by September so that we can roll out State-sponsored broadband delivery rapidly after that.  This is on top of what is already happening commercially, with about 300 farms per week, if the Deputy wants to raise the issue of agriculture, getting access to broadband.  We want to accelerate that in parts of Ireland that do not have commercial solutions.</p>  <p>  The idea that we should at this stage, because one operator has pulled out and we have another operator confirming that it wants to get on and do the business, stall the whole process and ask for another panel of experts to make recommendations would mean that nothing would happen for probably years and we would be starting all over again.  The Minister has an assurance that, actually, we are almost where we need to be in terms of spending hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money to make sure that rural Ireland gets the broadband it needs.</p><p>We are going to see this through.  It has been complex and difficult, but we were only months away from approving a preferred bidder before September.  That has essentially been fast-forwarded now and we need to work with Enet and others in the consortium which are big players in the sector.  This is not a small operation.  It is as big as the ESB or some of the bidders which have pulled out.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is now suggesting that the Government now somehow has the upper hand.  It is at the market and there is only one person there.  Its back is to the wall.  If the Government thinks it will be able to achieve the deadline which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, keeps avoiding questions on or that somehow it will get value for money for the taxpayer, it needs to wake up because it is not going to happen.</p>  <p>  The fact of the matter is that the two companies with the greatest footprint in the State, the greatest experience and the most established operators which understand the marketplace have pulled out.  If it is not plain to the T&aacute;naiste and the Government that there is a serious problem with the contract and tender it is proposing, then it does not understand what is going on.  It is about time that the Government faced up to what is happening.  People are deeply concerned that the Government is not even committed to providing broadband to the 540,000 homes which need it.

In 1994, an agreement was reached between the CI&Eacute; employees and the company to amalgamate five pension schemes, thereby allowing it to remove a potential &euro;73 million pension deficit from its book.  In return, employees were given certain assurances, the first of which was that the board of CI&Eacute; would guarantee the solvency of the pension schemes each year.  The second commitment given was that there would be regular post-retirement increases, but no specific rate was given.</p>  <p>  The company stuck to those commitments until 2009 when it failed to provide sufficient funding to ensure the solvency of the schemes in that year and in the following years.  This was against the advice tendered by the company's actuary.  Since then, the board of CI&Eacute; has underfunded the pension scheme to the tune of around &euro;80 million.  The assurance given by the Minister states: "In every year there shall be a contribution from the board to a fund of such sum as the board after consulting the actuary determines to be necessary to support and maintain the solvency of the fund."  Despite this, neither the Government nor the Minister has intervened to ensure that CI&Eacute; adheres to that order.  A blind eye has been turned to it.</p>  <p>  Not only has the company underfunded the pension scheme, by extension it has jeopardised the solvency of both CI&Eacute; pension scheme funds.  This issue was raised by the NBRU and SIPTU.  Yesterday, I proposed to the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that we invite the unions in to discuss these issues with the committee.  It has agreed to do that.  We will hear the unions' side of the story this month.</p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste that to remember that we are talking about people's pensions.  Last year, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was very unhappy with the prospect of being a lot poorer because a large part of his pension from Independent News &amp;amp; Media was being cut.  He blasted the proposals at that time as very unfair and unreasonable.  I sincerely hope he sees the seriousness of this issue for the thousands of workers in CI&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  The Government and Department have serious questions to answer.  Once again, it comes back to accountability and oversight pure and simple.  It is also an issue which has been known about by successive Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, one of whom is the current Taoiseach and another of whom is the Minister for Finance.  It is not an issue the Government can ignore the because CI&Eacute; has a legal obligation to adhere to the Minister's directive.</p>  <p>  When was the underfunding of the pension scheme brought to the attention of the Minister?

Like many other semi-State companies, CI&Eacute; has a responsibility towards its pensioners and workers who will be future pensioners in terms of ensuring that pension funds are solvent.  Many, if not all, of the semi-State companies and agencies have sought to restructure pension funds accordingly.  The ESB and Coillte have done so.  CI&Eacute; has worked with unions to ensure that there is an understanding around funding pension funds appropriately for the future.  There is an obligation on the board and management of CI&Eacute; to work with union representatives to make sure that is the case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy said she will have an opportunity to tease some of those things out in committee and hear the concerns of unions, which I welcome.  I would also like to make it very clear that boards and management in semi-State companies have a responsibility to face up to pension challenges, as the private sector has been doing for years.  That sometimes involves co-operation and compromise from the union side.  If that is not possible, then there is an infrastructure in the State to help to find compromise and resolution to those issues and problems.  CI&Eacute; should be no different.</p></speech>

It boils down to the fact that the Government has allowed CI&Eacute; to show blatant disregard for a ministerial order.  The issue was raised today in the Committee of Public Accounts by my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General said this was a statutory, rather than a private, pension scheme.  There are legislation and statutory instruments.  The Minister knows what "statutory" means - it means responsibility and with responsibility comes accountability.  The Government has allowed this to happen but I am quite sure it would not allow it to happen to its members' pensions, or I should say their multiple pensions.  Over 10,000 CI&Eacute; workers have been left in limbo for the past eight years because the Government has allowed CI&Eacute; to ignore statutory instruments.  The Government cannot hide behind CI&Eacute; on this issue.  CI&Eacute; has, quite simply, broken the law and I wonder if the T&aacute;naiste would care a bit more about it if it related to his pension.  Was this issue not brought to the Cabinet's attention?</p></speech>

There are hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across the country currently without access to high-speed broadband.  The tendering process collapsed yesterday when Eir withdrew, the second bidder to do so.  A tendering competition with one bidder is not a procurement process and I say that as the person who as Minister brought the last three procurement directives through the European Parliament.  The notion that the Minister would now portray this latest development as a good thing is delusional at best and cynically misleading at worst.  There is only one bidder so, by definition, the State now has no choice as to who will deliver the national broadband plan to 500,000 homes and businesses and it will only happen if the price of Enet can be afforded.</p>  <p>  The incompetent way in which this has been handled leaves the State over a barrel on price and the timeframe of implementation.  In effect, the country is now snookered and the Minister and his Department have lost control of the process.  The delays in rolling out the plan have allowed the dominant, near-monopoly player to increase its market share.  The original basis of the plan was critically undermined when the Minister allowed Eir to cherry pick over 300,000 homes in April 2017.  Was there an evaluation of the plan at that time, or of the consequences of that decision?  If one removes all the lucrative parts of any contract one should not be surprised when private businesses, which already dominate the market, decide they already have what they want and walk away from the process.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, must take responsibility for this disaster.  He managed to turn what had been a solid process into a mess, all in less than two years.  SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, withdrew from the tendering process in September stating there was no longer a business case once those 300,000 premises had been removed.  That only left Eir and Enet.  The Minister has facilitated a market grab by the largest player in the field, which already has a dominant position.  Through the delays in delivering the plan, Eir has been able to build an even more dominant position and undermine the prospect of a credible roll-out plan.</p>  <p>  The process over the past two years has driven credible providers out of the market.  Yesterday's news leaves more than 500,000 homes and businesses with no prospect of viable connectivity in the years to come.  Will the Government apologise to those who will now wait years for broadband, with no clear timeframe for when they will get it?  Is it not now the case that the State is totally beholden to one provider which can name its price, determine the timeframe and laugh at the Government?</p></speech>

The other 500,000 justifies, under State aid rules, significant public expenditure to pay for the roll-out of broadband and that is what is going to happen.  A number of operators have been part of this process and some have chosen to pull out but that does not mean companies have not submitted costings.  People are talking as if we are starting again.  We are not starting again but are at the very end of a very complex process which the Deputy set up.  We have one absolutely viable consortium which wants to do this with the State and has confirmed that again today.  It has submitted costings and we want to develop a partnership with it to make sure the 500,000 homes which need broadband, but would not get it under commercial conditions, will get it because it will be sponsored by the State.</p>  <p>  Our only focus is to get broadband to homes in rural Ireland as quickly as we can do that and that was the motivation behind giving the go-ahead for Eir to roll out broadband to 300,000 homes.  The other 500,000 which are still waiting, in frustration, expect the Government to find a way of getting fibre to them as quickly as we can.  Ending this process and starting all over again with a panel of experts is not the way to do this.  We have loads of experts advising us on this.</p></speech>

In the main, the focus has been on the economy and preparing the Irish economy for the impact.  We have had so many discussions around business, agriculture, jobs, the Single Market, the customs union, the common travel area and how the Good Friday Agreement is being undermined.  I look at all that and the drive, energy, work and commitment.  I know it is very necessary but I also look at what is happening in the north inner city where I am looking for even a fraction of that drive, energy and commitment on the issues that have seen such an escalation in violence, a callous indifference to life and the neglect of those communities and their way of life.</p>  <p>  I have heard comments that this violence and the number of murders in a small area would not be tolerated if it was to happen in the leafy suburbs of Dublin or Cork.  I suppose it would not be tolerated but that is missing the point.  The point is that it is not happening there and it would not happen there.  It is because those leafy suburbs were not neglected in the way the communities in the north inner city have been over many years and through many Governments when one looks at the difference between the areas in terms of housing, infrastructure, environment, the health of the residents, jobs, careers, disposable income, access to a variety of social activities and progression in education.  I would ask how much open drug dealing is happening on the streets of those leafy suburbs.  It is because of that difference that the inner city has been a fertile ground for the drug industry and all the mayhem, chaos and violence it brings.  It is telling that it took a string of murders to bring attention and focus on those issues in the north inner city.  </p>  <p>  I know it will not change overnight and I acknowledge the work that has started and the work of the garda&iacute; and their successes through their intelligence gathering but the reality is that there was another murder on Tuesday night, the evening before the funeral of another murder victim.  I think back to the first murder, which took place during the last election, but now it is almost like "oh, another murder in the north inner city, more of the gangland feud" and then it is forgotten about until the next one.  It is likely that there will be more.  The residents of the north inner city, particularly young people, teenagers and senior citizens, deserve the same respect as those who live in those leafy suburbs and they also deserve the same right to a peaceful existence enjoyed by people in other areas.  This will not happen unless there is a real urgency and a real commitment to tackle those issues that have brought about the chaos we are experiencing.  </p></speech>

The State's response here has to be across multiple different areas and initiatives.  From a justice and policing point of view, the type of criminal behaviour we have seen again this week has no place in a civilised society and will not be tolerated by the Government.  We are putting resources in place to ensure that this is the case.  Operation Hybrid has been established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and to address public safety concerns about community safety.  Operation Hybrid benefits from significant support by armed support units.  If we look at the result of that Garda response as of 21 January last, we see 72 arrests;13 charges in total, of which ten related to murder investigations and three of which related to other related offences; 34 firearms seized; in the region of 260 searches; and over 15,000 lines of inquiry conducted with more than 50,000 high-visibility checkpoints.  There is a significant step up in terms of Garda presence.</p>  <p>  I accept that this is not enough in terms of the State's collective response.  This is why under the previous Taoiseach, who felt very strongly about this issue, as does the current Taoiseach, we set up a north-east inner-city initiative to which the Deputy contributed in terms of the thinking on that chaired by Michael Stone.  The board includes representatives from the community and business sectors as well as key Government Departments and agencies.  The board has met every month since it was established last June and will shortly publish its 2017 report, including a comprehensive detailed report on spending across multiple areas from education to youth development to community development to sports facilities and all the other things that are a real deficit for communities living in this part of Dublin versus communities in other parts of Dublin.  That is a gap and deficit that this Government wants to overcome.  We will put very significant resources in place to try to do that.  </p></speech>

I go back to the point about inequality.  During last week's Leaders' Questions, I referred to the report from the World Economic Forum, which spoke about the income inequality in Ireland and the soaring wealth inequality.  It is that inequality that has led to the social deprivation and social neglect.  I really feel for young people.</p><p>Young people will not be able to realise their potential because they are living in an environment where they are open to exploitation and manipulation.  It is important that we get progress reports on the implementation of the Mulvey report.  We need to address the gaps identified by communities in the Mulvey report.</p></speech>

It is probably true to say there has never been better co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI than there is today.  We need to ensure through Brexit and post Brexit that co-operation is maintained and sustained so that vulnerable people who are being targeted by criminal gangs are protected North and South, and that the movement of gangs across the Border is addressed in as comprehensive a way as we can address it from a security point of view.</p>  <p>  The Government does not disagree with the concerns here.  The shootings in the past week are horrific.  We need to ask constantly if we can do more.  I assure the Deputy that resources are not the problem here.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na asks for more, for example, an increased emphasis on community policing and more resources for that, the Government's response will be very positive.  Resources are not the issue here.  From a policing perspective we need to listen to and work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on what it needs.  From a broader community development perspective we need to reassess constantly.</p></speech>

I chair a stakeholders' group that meets regularly and all the key sectors the Deputy mentioned are represented there.  This is an ongoing conversation.

The T&aacute;naiste will know this is European cervical cancer prevention week, which is a critical issue.  The Irish Family Planning Association and CervicalCheck are running their annual Pearl of Wisdom campaign.  Each year 260 women in Ireland are diagnosed with cervical cancer and up to 70 lives are lost.  Public awareness on screening is essential and women aged between 25 and 60 can avail of regular free checks.</p>  <p>  However, we all remember the recent controversy over the HPV vaccine.

Those workers informed me that they do not get payslips.  They do not know what deductions are being made.  They say Romanian workers are being paid less than the sectoral employment agreement rates.  This stuff is rampant.  Agencies are being set up that are not registered, paying people less.</p></speech>

It does not involve the introduction of any further or updated legislation.  The Garda at national level in the area to which the Deputy refers and at international level through Interpol is actively engaged with other international police forces.  Should there be an appropriate level of evidence to be levelled against any suspect, we will operate under the time-honoured system of the European arrest warrant in the expectation that anybody who is not residing in the jurisdiction and who faces charges in this State can be properly returned under these conditions.</p></speech>

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the T&aacute;naiste will have an important role to play in this.  There is tremendous concern at the prospect of the offering from the EU to the Mercosur countries supposedly increasing from 70,000 tonnes to 99,000 tonnes in the negotiations last week.  For any final deal, will it be a situation where all countries have to agree, in that we would have a veto or will it be by qualified majority voting?  Does the T&aacute;naiste know that at this stage?  If we are so against it and the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have taken such a hard line, as they tell us, why is the European Commission proceeding with increasing the beef offering?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us information on that?  As negotiations continue over the next week, will the T&aacute;naiste get the ear of relevant Commissioners and ensure that beef is not sold out at the expense of doing a trade deal?</p></speech>

We are the largest beef exporter in the northern hemisphere.  The EU's market for beef is crucial for us in the future.  Any trade deal negotiated and finalised by the EU is one we are watching closely.  No final deal has been agreed to my understanding.  Ireland and other countries, particularly France, have raised concerns about the sensitive issue of beef.  The way in which the EU handles trade is that the Commission has the mandate to negotiate, but that negotiating mandate is determined by member states.  Ireland and France have continuously raised concerns that, if a deal is to be done, beef access needs to be part of that.</p></speech>

There is currently a critical situation where there are 700 farmers around the country who have contracts or partnerships with Coillte and are being treated abysmally by a semi-State company.  They are not being paid.  There is no communication.  It is a scandalous situation.  We need the Government to intervene.  I know it is a semi-State company and that it is at arm's length, but the way it is treating citizens is shameful.</p></speech>

The Government is conscious that there is an obligation to follow through on some of the legislation that is still outstanding to ensure consistency with the convention.  On the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which deals with the deprivation of liberty issues, the Government hopes to bring it forward, if not this term then very shortly after that, but I suspect it may well be dealt with this side of the summer.</p></speech>

We are working on the establishment of the scheme in conjunction with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, as part of the new change management programme.  The legislation in place may not be sufficient to do what we want to do with the RTB.  We may need to bring in new legislation to supplement the primary legislation.  We are moving to do what the Deputy suggests but doing so is not as simple as we thought it would be in terms of the existing legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100021#T00100"><p>I move Amendment No. 3:</p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes that&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;&mdash; the number of individuals or couples with a housing need that are neither eligible to apply for social housing because of the low income thresholds, nor able to afford to purchase a private home at current prices, far exceeds the approximately 100,000 on the social housing list, possibly by a factor of three;<br /><br />&mdash; since taking office in 2011, Fine Gael have not delivered a single affordable home through any Government scheme;<br /><br />&mdash; the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness contains no targets and no clear funding stream for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; the Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il Confidence and Supply Arrangement for a Fine Gael-led Minority Goverment has no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il have facilitated two Fine Gael budgets despite neither containing any credible proposals for delivering affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Budget 2018 proposals contain no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;90 million Help to Buy Scheme is driving up house prices and by the most generous estimate will help no more than 1,000 home purchases;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is unlikely to deliver significant numbers of genuinely affordable housing and may deliver no affordable homes in Dublin;<br /><br />&mdash; the &euro;25 million affordable housing fund announced in Budget 2018 will only deliver 650 affordable homes;<br /><br />&mdash; the revised local authority first-time buyers mortgage will be of limited value if genuinely affordable homes are not available to purchase;<br /><br />&mdash; the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones has not constrained rents by 4 per cent, particularly with respect to new tenancies;<br /><br />&mdash; no affordable homes will be delivered by any Government scheme in 2018; and<br /><br />&mdash; no precise definition of affordable rental homes has been forthcoming but the indications that such rents would be pitched at approximately 80 per cent of market rates, or worked out on the basis of a 25 year cost recovery on the commercial construction cost, are in no manner &lsquo;affordable&rsquo;; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to:<br /><br />&mdash; immediately introduce regulations to ensure that, independent of commitments in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a minimum of 20 per cent affordable housing is delivered in all private developments;<br /><br />&mdash; directly construct 100,000 council and affordable homes over the next five years;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately establish what price or rent level is defined as affordable and to ensure that this is genuinely affordable for those on average incomes above the eligibility threshold for council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; achieve mixed income public housing estates through a combination of affordable housing but also by raising the eligibility criteria for renting local authority homes, at minimum, to include all with a housing need that cannot purchase privately at current market rates;<br /><br />&mdash; not deplete the public housing stock, as happened in the past, by making it mandatory that the local authority have first refusal in buying back affordable homes that occupants seek to sell;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately introduce an affordable housing scheme for public land that will ensure no land is sold off, in part or in whole, to private developers or landlords and further ensure that public private partnerships will not be considered in the context of council and/or affordable housing on public land;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that in any delivery of affordable homes on public land, all of these homes remain affordable into the future i.e. where purchasers do sell at a future date, they will be required to sell back to the local authority and that home will be either resold as affordable or revert to council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; fund the delivery of the affordable housing schemes through a combination of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund/Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), Housing Finance Agency and exchequer funding as appropriate, and provide local authorities with multi-annual funding commitments to facilitate forward planning;<br /><br />&mdash; design the HBFI fund to prioritise loan finance to small and medium-sized builders participating in council-led affordable housing schemes;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that all residential housing on National Asset Management Agency sites, or on sites supported by the Strategic Investment Fund, will be a mix of council and affordable housing only, with no housing on these sites being sold at market prices;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that all LIHAF and HBFI funded developments deliver, independent of any commitment in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, 40 per cent affordable homes as per the Government&rsquo;s original proposal for LIHAF, putting in place appropriate claw-back mechanisms to ensure the State benefits proportionately on any capital gain arising from future sale of these homes;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately scrap the failed &lsquo;Land Initiative&rsquo; and commit appropriate public funding to all council developments for projects currently underway in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Park and St Michael's Estate in Dublin City, The Grange/Kilcarberry in South Dublin and Shangannagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but ensure that all of these lands remain in full public ownership and that any affordable housing remains affordable into the future and that any tenure mix on these sites will ensure a majority percentage being developed as traditional council housing;<br /><br />&mdash; identify public sites around the country for similar council-led developments and introduce legislation to allow for the purchase of land needed to meet the public and affordable housing needs, at use value prices, and immediately bring forward plans similar to the Damastown proposal in Fingal and Whitechurch in Cork brought forward by Solidarity-People Before Profit public representatives;<br /><br />&mdash; commit the required funding to ensure the maximum council and affordable housing in the Poolbeg and Clonburris Strategic Development Zone's (SDZ) and to dramatically increase the proportion of council and affordable homes in the Cherywood SDZ;<br /><br />&mdash; amend Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to provide for a minimum of 20 per cent council housing requirement;<br /><br />&mdash; introduce real rent controls that allow local authorities to set rents at affordable levels and ensure that future rent increases are linked to an index such as the Consumer Price Index; and<br /><br />&mdash; defend and maintain the differential rent levels in local authority rented housing.&rdquo;</blockquote></speech>

He was murdered because of his name and as part of an ongoing feud that has, for the last number of years, dominated certain parts of this city.  Six days ago, there was another example of this feud and its damaging influence when gunshots were fired outside of the National Stadium on South Circular Road.  Two men were injured.  It was thought that one of the targets was a 40 year-old man.  The Garda stated that this is part of the ongoing feud, the Kinahan-Hutch dispute that has now been going on for two and a half years.  Then, two days ago, we saw another brutal murder.  A man was brutally murdered on the North Strand simply because of his association, it appears, with the Hutch family.  He too was only 27 years of age.</p>  <p>  These murders are brutal and cowardly for very many reasons.  First, they are brutal and cowardly because, as happened with the man who was murdered 11 days ago, people are lured to places against their will.  They are brutal and cowardly because people attack victims from behind as they are getting into a car and shoot them in the head.  They are brutal and cowardly because individuals are targeted because of their name, or because of their friendship with a particular family.  Most of all, they are brutal and cowardly because of the damaging and traumatic influence and impact the violence is having on the community in the north inner city, a very proud community that wishes, like any other, to ensure that its children are brought up in a safe and peaceful environment.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Over the last two and a half years or so, approximately 15 people have been murdered as a result of this feud.  It is simply unacceptable and we, as legislators and as politicians in this House, have to re-emphasise consistently that it is unacceptable.  I know there is no one, easy solution to this problem.  I know it is ongoing criminal activity that can only be resolved through investment in local communities, resources on the ground and responses by the Legislature to issues that must be raised.  They are the responsibility of different groups throughout society.  However, one of the entities - in fact, the entity - that has the most power to effect that change and fight this criminal activity is the Government.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is the Minister in this Government responsible for ensuring that the people of this city, the people of the north inner city, in particular, are kept safe.</p>  <p>  I want to know what the Minister for Justice and Equality is going to do about of this.  Something has to be done about it.  I want to know if, since he has the power, the Minister proposes to bring forward changes to the law.  I was particularly concerned when it was reported recently that the armed response unit and the special detective unit may have been subject to cutbacks.  We need to ensure that the Garda presence in the north inner city, which has been very effective over the last two years or so, is maintained.  We cannot just take our foot off the pedal in the hope that this problem will go away.  It has not gone away.  It is still there.</p>  <p>  Of course, the Minister is the central authority in the State for matters pertaining to extradition.  I know it is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but why is it, if individuals are masterminding these criminal acts from outside the State, that no steps are being taken to bring them to justice within this State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100023#Z00300"><p>I wish to thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this issue of great seriousness in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I will be addressing this issue from a criminal justice perspective, but of course it is important to note that the Government's focus on removing organised criminals' grip on areas is not confined to a criminal justice approach.  A multiplicity of supports are involved across a range of Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  The fatal shooting that took place earlier this week in Dublin's North Strand is currently under active investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The House will appreciate that the manner in which particular investigations are conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  I have no role in such investigations.  The shooting occurred within days of the brutal killing of Derek Hutch near Cloverhill Prison and the non-fatal shootings which took place outside the National Stadium on the South Circular Road on 26 January this year.  I wish to assure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also conducting a comprehensive investigation into both of these incidents.  I wish it well with its endeavours and inquiries, and I join the garda&iacute; in calling for anybody with any information to report that potential evidence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear.  This type of criminal behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  It will not be tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again.  I note that there has been some commentary this week to the effect that the State provides fewer resources to the policing of organised crime north of the River Liffey, or that little is done to stop gangland figures from killing each other.  Such assertions are ill-informed and without foundation.  In the first instance, the Garda has, in fact, prevented a huge amount of violence and crime in recent times.  Successes of this kind go under the radar and are not reported on the news on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that the Garda, supported by significant resources allocated to it by this Government, has made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in the north Dublin inner city area.  Operation Hybrid has been established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  It benefits from significant support by armed support units.  As of 21 January, this response has resulted in 72 arrests, 13 charges in total, 34 firearms seized, 260 searches, 15,260 lines of inquiry conducted and more than 50,450 high-visibility checkpoints implemented with active support from the armed support units.  A significant about of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence has also been examined.</p>  <p>  In addition, the conviction earlier this week in the Special Criminal Court of Eamonn Cumberton for the murder of Michael Barr in the Sunset House pub in April 2016, and the convictions of two other men apprehended in possession of a large number of firearms, were feud-related.  They came about as a result of concentrated efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle the perpetrators involved in this ongoing feud.  We have also seen reports of a series of very significant drug seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as important seizures of significant banking information used to fuel the activities of organised criminals.  These seizures have significantly hampered the ability of these gangs to operate.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not allow these criminals to prevail.  It will ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes will be apprehended and brought to justice as quickly as possible.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that these endeavours will continue to be fully supported by this Government. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100023#Z00400"><p>I agree with the Minister that this is not simply a criminal justice issue, but it is predominantly a criminal justice issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is the person within the Government who is responsible for criminal justice and for the resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  With respect to the Minister, it is not sufficient for him to simply state that he wishes the Garda well in these endeavours.  The Garda needs more than to be wished well by Government.  It needs to be given full and adequate resources to ensure that this vicious feud can be stopped, so that the people of the north inner city can be protected.  If, as the Minister said, the following is incorrect, I would like to see his statistics on the matter but it was reported that armed patrol units in the north inner city have been cut by 30% and that the covert backup by the special detective unit has also been cut.  If that is so, it needs to be reversed. </p><p>This is not the time to cut back on Garda resources just as the feud appears to be reigniting.  Everyone in the House has a responsibility which the Minister has recognised to ensure the people of the north inner city will not be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to their protection.  They are being exposed to a vicious, violent feud that is having a traumatic effect on families and young people in the vicinity.  We have a responsibility to ensure we face up to it and the best way to do that is to ensure the Garda has the resources it needs.  I ask the Minister to meet assistant Garda commissioner Leahy to ensure he is properly informed on whether adequate resources are being provided for the force.  Why are extradition requests not being submitted to European countries in respect of gangland criminals against whom there is sufficient evidence that they are responsible for instructing others to kill people on the streets of this city?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00200"><p>I meet the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda officers on a regular basis and will do so again in the near future.  Garda operations in Dublin's north inner city are underpinned by increased resources made available to the force by the Government.  In budget 2018 approximately &euro;100 million has been allocated for Garda overtime to support ongoing operations such as Operation Hybrid.  In 2016, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, funding was approved by the previous Government for the setting up of a dedicated armed support unit in the Dublin metropolitan region.  It is now operational on a 24/7 basis.</p>  <p>  The allocation and management of Garda resources, including the overtime budget, as the Deputy will be aware, are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, having due regard to operational needs.  I have no role in that regard.  It is a matter for Garda management to utilise the resources made available to it by the Government in the most efficient and effective manner, while also ensuring high visibility policing in communities to tackle the scourge of gangland crime head on.  Garda&iacute; are active on the international stage through Interpol and Europol and on a bilateral basis with other European states.  Action is well under way to ensure that if there is sufficient evidence, those responsible will be brought before the courts.  The Government has enacted legislation to target criminal activities further, including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2016 which provides additional powers for the Garda, in particular to immediately seizure assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them from being disposed of.</p>  <p>  While the allocation of Garda personnel is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I am advised that since January 2017, a number of new and additional garda&iacute; have been assigned to Store Street, Mountjoy and Bridewell Garda stations.  Furthermore, work is progressing towards the reopening of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, with funding for the project having been made available in the mid-term capital review.  A dedicated community policing office is also based in Store Street Garda station for the north central division to ensure the issues highlighted by the local community and stakeholders will be dealt with in an effective manner.</p>  <p>  All of the endeavours we have discussed will continue to be supported fully by me and my Government colleagues.  This type of crime will not be tolerated.  We will continue to stand with the people of the north inner city.</p></speech>

As a result, the remaining staff were left to work in extreme conditions.  With their union, they have been trying to secure adequate staffing levels to ensure patient safety.  Conditions got so bad that on 2 January, they were due to work to rule.  At the last minute, however, the HSE decided to reintroduce 14 agency staff for a period of one month.  That time is up and the HSE has informed staff that 16 nursing and five home care assistant posts will be lost.  What steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that will not happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00400"><p>As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien outlined, the hospital plays a crucial role in providing health services for people in the city and surrounding areas.  It provides rehabilitation and step-down facilities for patients from Cork University Hospital and the Mercy Hospital, which frees up a substantial number of acute beds.  The hospital has a number of vitally important rehabilitation wards.  In recent months it has come under severe pressure.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien outlined, the last minute reintroduction of agency staff in early January is coming to an end and it appears that 16 nursing and five home care assistant posts will be cut.  This will result in additional pressure being put on a hospital that is already under significant pressure.  The medical staff, particularly the nurses, are not only concerned about their working conditions but also about the effects on services and patient health.  This is happening at a time when we should be investing in health services, not cutting back.  It is wrong that there is any prospect of cutbacks at St. Finbarr's Hospital</p></speech>

As my colleagues outlined, cutting staff and creating a toxic environment in any hospital, never mind St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork, is criminal.  On top of this, we have heard the magic word "review".  A review is a money saving initiative on the part of the HSE.  One of the staff said, "We are just hanging in there."  If that is what passes for a job, the HSE and the Government have a lot to answer for.  I appeal to the Minister of State to treat the staff with respect.  They do a wonderful job and should be respected.  Given what they do, all nurses should be sent a "Thank You" card and beatified when they finish work.  It is not a job but a vocation.  I ask the Minister of State to address this issue in a humane way, not with statistics or a review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100024#AA00600"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I thank the three Deputies for raising it and expressing their concerns.</p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and with independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what they and everybody in this House want.  We also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long-stay or short-stay basis.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St Finbarr's Hospital.  The hospital is part of the older persons social care directorate and one of 24 hospitals in the Cork Kerry Community Hospitals Group. </p>  <p>  The HSE has worked with the Irish Nursing and Midwives Organisation in recent months on staffing levels and ratios at the hospital.  HSE management has undertaken a review of staffing in consultation with the nursing unions, with a view to ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels and a skills mix to meet the care needs of the residents in long-term care and the rehabilitation wards.  It included a review of resource management, the skills mix and service costs.  The executive proposes to reconfigure the staffing levels and skills mix at the hospital to provide for optimum use of approved staffing resources and a reduction in the over-reliance on overtime and agency costs.  The current proposal, if implemented, will potentially provide for a reduction of 16.5 nursing whole-time equivalents and 5.1 health care assistant whole-time equivalents.  This will eliminate the reliance on the use of agency staff and maximise overall direct employment within the hospital.</p>  <p>  The HSE has assured the Department that there are no plans to reduce the number of directly employed staff at the hospital and certainly there are no plans for redundancies.  The Department understands the executive has demonstrated that staffing levels in terms of WTEs have increased in the past few years and that HSE management is satisfied that the reconfigured staffing levels will be adequate to provide the service being delivered.</p><p>The engagement between management, staff, the INMO and SIPTU is underpinned by the terms of the national public service stability agreement.  Agreement was not reached locally and notification was issued for the commencement of industrial action. The matter progressed to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, conciliation services and the parties met in December 2017.  Following subsequent correspondence and discussions, an interim arrangement was put in place without prejudice to either party&rsquo;s position and this has provided for the deferral of any industrial action, with the agreement to engage on the change programme as soon as possible.  This was in place until yesterday, 31 January.</p> <p> A conciliation conference has been organised by the WRC for 8 February 2018.  Management has agreed to an extension of the interim arrangements up to and including the date of the WRC conciliation conference and to not later than Thursday, 15 February which will allow a reasonable period for the parties to consider any proposal emerging from the WRC process.  This issue is being addressed by the HSE and key stakeholders through an agreed process, and officials from the Department will continue to monitor this situation carefully.  The HSE has been asked to keep the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, updated on developments.</p></speech>

She is saying that a review of staffing has been undertaken in consultation with the nursing unions with a view to ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels within the hospital.  Anyone reading that would presume that there may not be safe and adequate staffing levels at present and therefore we should be looking at increasing them.  However, the reconfiguration of staffing levels to ensure that there is a safe level of staff within the hospitals entails cutting 21 whole-time equivalent posts.  That makes no sense.  I am glad that the interim period is being extended until the issue comes before the WRC, but staff are telling us that the conditions are unsafe and the Minister of State's answer is not to employ more staff but to cut 21 posts.  It is ridiculous.</p></speech>

It seems extraordinary that the Department is asserting that there was consultation with the unions on staffing figures and yet the situation has proceeded to a work to rule and now to the Workplace Relations Commission.  That does not sound like an ordinary process.  It certainly does not seem that any points which may have been made by the unions in consultation were taken into account.  The Minister of State referred to agency staff and said that there is no threat to permanent staff, but it is clear that the global figure, inclusive of agency and permanent staff, will be reduced and nothing the Minister of State has said indicates the contrary.  On the basis of current proposals there will a reduction of 16 nursing staff and five home care assistants.  The Minister of State is saying that no permanent staff will be got rid of but the hospital will still be down staff.  That will put pressure on the permanent staff and will lead to a reduction in services.  The HSE and the Department need to back away from what is very clearly a cutback which will compromise safety and health care and will continue to put nurses, who are already in a precarious position, under extreme pressure.</p></speech>

We see the words "issue" and "review".  I do not believe a bit of it.  This has been festering for months.  Were it not for the bravery of the staff within St. Finbarr's Hospital in speaking out on this issue, it would not even have come to the fore.  The way staff are being treated is disgusting.  It beggars belief that we will not invest in our elderly people.  I have nothing against the agency staff, but we need to maintain a proper level of staff within our hospitals and give them a sense of purpose and belonging.  I hear that the issue is being addressed by the HSE but it has failed so many times that it is frightening.  I spoke to the INMO a while back and I was told that the HSE is spending &euro;2 million a week on agency staff.  I do not understand why we cannot retain our own staff, who are experienced and believe in what they do, within the system.  I ask the Minister of State to go back and get a proper black and white statement so that we can go back to the staff in St. Finbarr's and tell them that their jobs are secure and that they are doing a great job.</p></speech>

The HSE remains committed to ensuring an effective and efficient information and consultation process with the staff and the trade unions on the proposed change programme.  Management is satisfied that the proposed staffing levels and skill mix will be provided for the enhancement of nursing duties.

The Minister came back promptly with factual information on the numbers attending and so on.  I appreciate that.  However, my question was whether she had been made aware of the issue and what alternative steps she will take.  The reason I asked that question is that we have received very urgent representations, primarily from the most important people, namely, the parents of the children who will be affected.  That is more than 40 families.  Unusually for them, people from the legal profession - solicitors and barristers - have got together to say that this is an essential service.  They are publicly on the record as saying that this service must be kept.  Therapists and various other professionals who use the service have also made representations to us in respect of this service.</p>  <p>  This service was set up in 2007.  It has been there for more than ten years.  It has had two positive evaluations, one in 2008 and one in 2016.  Both pointed to the essential nature of the service and to the positive effect on children.  I do not have much time to speak on this but I will bring the Minister's attention to the conclusions of the 2016 report, where figures are given.  It says that the service enhances the positive relationships between parents and children and so on.</p><p>They cannot do without this service.  If it is closed, 40 or more families will be affected.  Primarily, children will not see their fathers.  It is run on a shoestring budget of approximately &euro;80,000 per year and has four staff, one of whom is full-time.</p> <p> We have spoken to the directors.  The only difficulty seems to relate to the governance structure and providing cover at the weekend.  Problems seldomly arise at the weekend.  The house costs nothing because it is in Tusla's ownership.  It will remain open and has ample space for the other services provided therein.  A number of Deputies met the directors last week.</p> <p> People with legal and psychological care backgrounds are happy to serve on the board, but they have never been contacted.  Last Monday, the directors confirmed to us that it was an essential service and they wanted it kept open at all costs.</p> <p> To repeat myself, it is run on a shoestring budget and there have been no problems on the ground.  The problem with the governance structure is not insurmountable.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughton has also done work on this issue.  I support what has been said.  It is important to recognise that all the Galway Deputies are concerned.</p>  <p>  Governance has become an issue when trying to get people involved in boards because they are afraid of the responsibilities.  It is fine when there is a large professional staff, but it would be a tragedy if important services were lost because people felt that there was too much governance and not enough backup to support it.  Money is useful because, if a board has money, it can buy expertise.</p>  <p>  This is a vital service and it should be supported.  We must decide that, where services are concerned, structures can never be more important than the reality on the ground.  Sometimes, important services cannot fit inside structures, but that is not a justification for not having the services.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to clarify the circumstances surrounding Time 4 Us and the wider picture of child contact centres.  We all agree that the long-term goal is a quality service delivered to all children in all areas.  However, it is important to ensure that any service delivered to children and families is of a high quality.  Services must be appropriate to local needs and sustainable.</p>  <p>  Child contact centres are safe, friendly and neutral places where children can spend time with the parent or parents with whom they do not live.  The centre provides a child-centred environment that allows the child to continue a relationship with the parent at the child's pace and in his or her own way, usually through play and child-centred activities.</p>  <p>  Services of this nature are used by children and families in a wide range of circumstances, some of which can be difficult or contentious.  These centres may also cater to children whose parents are separated and cannot agree contact arrangements.  Children in the care of Tusla, who need support to have access with their families, also use the service.  I paid attention to Deputy Connolly outlining aspects of that in this case.</p>  <p>  Time 4 Us was established in 2007.  The service's purpose is to provide parents who do not live with their children with a facility where they can spend time together.  A total of 41 families are currently using the service, 36 of which were referred by the courts or private family law services.  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's concerns relate to the funding of this service, but I will draw his attention to the additional reasons given by the board of directors for closing the service.  These include significant challenges in terms of board membership and sustainable governance, which Deputy Connolly referenced.  Several members of the board wish to retire in the coming years and the board has struggled to find suitable replacements.  It has also struggled to provide staff for weekend cover, which is a time of high demand.</p>  <p>  Time 4 Us operates an on-call rota at the weekend to provide support to the staff in the centres.  It previously received funding from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality as well as from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP.  In 2016, the service's main funding came from grants from Tusla and the Galway City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committee, with the remainder coming from the SVP.  However, the funding from the SVP has now ceased.</p>  <p>  A decision has been made by the board of directors to cease the service on 31 March.  Tusla will work with the board to identify alternative supports that current service users can avail of in the local area.  It is important to ensure that the services provided for access and contact are safe, of the highest quality and sustainable.</p></speech>

It has been brought to her attention that this is an essential service.  We cannot do without it.  Indeed, it should be rolled out nationally.  Of the reasons given, finance was not one.  It is run on a shoestring budget.  Staffing was not mentioned as a problem.  Four staff run it.  There were no difficulties at the weekend.  The primary difficulty related to the governance structure, that is, covering the weekend.</p>  <p>  Any number of people with adequate legal and psychological skills as well as other skills would serve on the board.  That is not a difficulty.  Rather, the problem is with the governance structure.  Only three directors are necessary.  Some want to retire, with which I do not have a difficulty.  They have done a good job.  The Minister is standing over the closure of this service because of a small problem with a governance structure.  Tusla has to step in and recognise that it must provide active support at the weekend.  Rarely does a problem arise.  We asked about all of this.  Will the Minister re-examine the matter and revert to us?</p></speech>

In a situation like this, the way forward is for people to meet face to face.  It seems to be going out of fashion in many facets of our lives.  I suggest that the people with responsibility for ensuring these types of service sit down, go through the issues and devise a solution.  Governance has rightly grown more onerous, but we must ensure that it does not become a barrier to the provision of services.  The assistance that is needed to provide that governance should be given.  The only way for this situation to be resolved is through face-to-face discussions around a table with the appropriate authorities.</p>  <p>  Money is an issue, given that the SVP withdrew its funding.  Where there is enough funding, one can buy any governance expertise that is required.</p></speech>

That said, I hear what the Deputies are saying.  In particular, Deputy Connolly referred to how there were barristers and psychologists who were willing to serve on the board.  That there were two positive reviews of the service is helpful information for me.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies can imagine, I am concerned about how family breakdowns are stressful for children.  Anything that can be done to assist them and their families in that context should have our support.  The question is one of how to do that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly asked whether we could re-examine the matter.  Deputies Naughton and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggested a face-to-face meeting.  I will commit to calling to arrange a meeting with members of the board - I will also ask Tusla to join us - in order to re-examine the situation and discuss the Deputies' points.  I will revert to the Deputies subsequently.</p></speech>

Some &euro;450,000 has been spent on draining the pitches and &euro;260,000 was spent on fencing, including &euro;120,000 of which was public money.</p>  <p>  They are now even more shocked to discover that in response to their campaign, which involved appealing to the Minister and Christian Brothers not to do this to the school and steal their facilities from them the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, ERST, has now, in an act of purely vindictive retaliation against the campaigning of the school, threatened to dissolve the voluntary board of Clonkeen College.  It is an absolutely extraordinary act of bullying by ERST against the school.  The voluntary board is doing nothing more than trying to protect the interests of the school and its students.  It is ERST which, incredibly, has claimed that the board is acting against the interests of the school when it is ERST which is acting against the interest of the school by threatening to take away the playing pitches and dissolve the school board.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, the request to dissolve the board has to be approved by him.  To put it bluntly, this is a moment of truth for the Government in terms of deciding which side it is on.  I and the Minister know that the school is asking him to back the board and school and dismiss out-of-hand the outrageous suggestion that the board be dissolved by ERST.  As the Minister knows, the members of the board have been forced to take very costly legal action to try to protect the pitches.  The case will be heard in the High Court in March.  They ask that not only the Minister reject the proposal to dissolve the board but that he back the board in its legal action against the congregation to protect the pitches for the school's students.</p>  <p>  Not only is this important for the 500 students of the school and future generations of students, it will also affect students in the moderate to general learning disability facility.  It was built recently and will be directly and very negatively impacted by the development proposal and plan to sell the pitches.  St. John of God services in the area said that it was dismayed to hear about the planned sale of the sports fields and the negative impact this would surely have on students with disabilities.  It went on to say that the change would have a dramatic negative impact on their environment as noise and other distractions would wreak havoc with their learning and greatly impede the teachers' ability to connect and teach.  It implored the Minister to support the school and board.  I ask that the Minister do that, and indicate that he will not agree to dissolve the board and instead support the school.</p></speech>

My home is a few hundred metres away.  My neighbours' children are pupils in the school.  Many former pupils of mine have been educated there.  Clonkeen College is an outstanding school with an excellent reputation and offers a comprehensive and holistic education to all its students, including a wide range of sports such as football.</p>  <p>  I also want to draw attention to the special needs unit in the school.  It serves children and allows them to access a special education which I understand needs to be delivered in a caring and special environment.  I supported the special needs unit during my time as principal of The Harold School and have visited it.  I have seen at first hand the great work which is carried out within the special needs unit.  I know from first-hand experience how well the school has been managed and its competent board of management.</p>  <p>  The Department and taxpayer, as is well known, has invested over &euro;10 million in its development and enhancement in recent years.  I want to put on the record of the House that I have worked tirelessly since last summer to facilitate a resolution to this issue.  I arranged a meeting between the Minister for Education and Skill, the principal, members of staff, board and Department to which I invited Deputy Boyd Barrett and other elected representatives.  I subsequently met the school principal, board of management and individual parents, pupils and stakeholders on numerous occasions.  I have communicated with stakeholders and the school principal, often on a biweekly basis and, in some cases, on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  I understand the statutory responsibilities of the Minister for Education and Skills in this process.  However, as an elected Member for D&uacute;n Laoghaire and a former school principal in the area who spent 31 years of my career in educating children, I still believe that talks between both sides is the best route forward.  As a local Deputy, I am available to do whatever I can to bring both sides back to the table.</p></speech>

I am very much aware of the concern of the Deputy which has been expressed on a number of occasions in the House.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, said I met parents and the board of the school.  Genuine efforts have been made to resolve differences, but they have not been fruitful to date.</p>  <p>  The position has changed to an extent, in that two things have occurred.  I understand the board of management has taken a legal case in respect of the sale of the land and that case is due to be heard in the High Court in March.  Clearly, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate about the outcome of that matter which is before the court.</p>  <p>  Separately, I have been informed by my Department officials that the patron of Clonkeen College, ERST, has now sought approval to dissolve the board of management of the college in accordance with section 16 of the Education Act 1998.  I understand that request is connected to the legal case taken by the board of management regarding the sale of the land.  However, the statutory process of dissolution is under way and, as Minister for Education and Skills, I must take a decision having considered the submissions made on all sides.</p>  <p>  I have a statutory duty to consider the request in accordance with the provisions of that Act and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on matters which are related to the dissolution.  To make such a comment would be to prejudge a statutory function which I, as Minister, must now discharge, having received the best legal advice.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position as it now stands.</p></speech>

We have an extraordinary situation which could have been resolved if the Minister told the Christian Brothers that it is not taking the pitches to pay off the redress scheme because that is punishing future generations of kids for the crimes of the Christian Brothers against past generations of kids.  The Minister should have done that at the beginning.</p>  <p>  This also raises the extraordinary situation whereby schools which are publicly funded are run by patron bodies which, it seems, are accountable to nobody.  They are not accountable to the Government which funds them.</p><p>It is absolutely ridiculous.  Now ERST, which is supposed to be protecting the interests of the school, is threatening to dissolve a school board which has been exemplary.  There should be no question of its being dissolved as its members have defended the interests of the school and its playing pitches.  The board should be commended and the Minister should get behind it, by telling the Christian Brothers and ERST where to get off.  In what sense is ERST acting in the interests of the school?  It is demanding to sell lands for &euro;18 million to pay a debt which is only &euro;9 million so where is the rest of the money going?  Is there a conflict of interest here?  What are ERST and the brothers going to do with the rest of the money?</p> <p> The Minister needs to get off the fence and tell the Christian Brothers there is no way we will dissolve a board which has done fantastic work to defend the school.  He also needs to step in to resolve this in a way that secures the pitches for the school for the future.</p></speech>

Many powers which the Deputy wishes I had are powers which I do not have.  However, I have one very important power under section 16 of the Act, where I have to adjudicate on a proposal by a patron to dissolve a board.  I will do this in a way that is fair to all sides.  I will not comment on anyone's interests or motivations as I have to evaluate those fairly, hearing all sides.  That is the way I am going to approach this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100028#EE00400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy Martin Ferris.  The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 is designed to put in place a licence specifically for those fishermen who live on our offshore islands and who gain their incomes from island fishing.  It is a small number of people in the context of the overall fishing fleet.  Small-scale fishing is carried out by vessels with a length of less than 12 m, which do not use towed fishing gear, as listed in table 3 of Commission Regulation EC26-2004.  We are talking about small-scale coastal fishing which occurs within a six-mile territorial limit, including the baseline.  Most fishing in the six-mile zone involves fish that would not affect the quota and it is expected the quota required would be less than 1% of the overall national quota.  The licence would be non-transferable and the holder would not be able to lease it or transfer it to any other person.  The licence holder would have to be on board the vessel while fishing so worries about abuse in this respect are taken care of in the Bill.</p>  <p>  We are trying to bring about the introduction of a non-transferable community island quota.  I am delighted that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle, is present because this comes from an earlier cross-party D&aacute;il committee of which he was Chair.  I congratulate him on his work to bring the Bill this far and, now that others have brought it further, I am sure we will be able to welcome the support of the Minister and the Government, who were there at its conception.</p>  <p>  The quota is for appropriate species within the six-mile limit.  We are talking about artisan fishing, which happens in many parts of the world in small coastal communities that depend on fishing.  It is not about the big vessels.  The people who engage in small-scale fishing look out to the sea and they notice that the fish stocks are getting smaller and smaller as the huge vessels, especially the supertrawlers, clean them out.  Around this time last year I attended a conference at the United Nations on the sustainable development goals for 2014, which was about keeping our ocean environments clean and pure.  One of the big issues was on protecting the rights of artisan fishers across the world and clipping the wings of large fishing vessels with regulations of some sort.  Many fishermen find they cannot catch the fish they have traditionally fished for, sometimes for centuries.  </p>  <p>  This Bill deals with island fishermen because small coastal communities are under huge pressure.  The proposal first came from the committee because island communities are being decimated by depopulation.  Between 1986 and 2006, Arranmore Island lost 206 people, Bere Island in Cork is down by 63 people in the same period, and there are almost 120 fewer people living on the Aran Islands.  They are losing their populations with every generation and the cross-party committee recognised that we needed to do something to help arrest that trend.  We hope this Bill can be developed speedily to Committee Stage so that the Government can issue fishing licences to people who live on, and fish off, the islands for their livelihoods.  It would use a very small portion of quota but would ensure their livelihoods were maintained and sustained into the future.</p>  <p>  Some people have said it is difficult for the Government to divide the quota in this manner because the island fishermen do not have the necessary track record but article 17 in the regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy makes it clear that it is within the competency of the member state to decide how it uses the quota it is given, stating that member states shall use "transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature".  The Government does not have to base the quota on previous actions by fishermen but can base it on the specific environmental, economic and social context in which these fishermen make their living.  We are trying to ensure island fishermen can make a living into the future.</p>  <p>  I come from south Leitrim, which has a very small coastline and no habitable offshore island.  I am close to Longford in the midlands but people from all over Ireland have huge empathy with our fishing community.  They understand that they go out on small boats to make a living, taking huge risks in the process.  When people are lost at sea there is huge sympathy for the people in the community, who work hard to make a difference for their families.</p>  <p>  This Bill is about a specific quota for island communities so that we can make a difference into the future.  Many Deputies support the Bill and I appeal to the Minister, who was there at its conception, to work with his colleagues in government to make the Bill a reality.  I appeal to him to support it going to Committee Stage and being passed in the Houses so that we can do something concrete for island communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100028#EE00500"><p>This year, I will have been in this House for 16 years and, to be honest, there is an awful lot of bull and waffle here.  However, this Bill, which was conceived in 2012 with the report of the committee chaired by Deputy Andrew Doyle, is one of the better things with which I have been associated.</p><p>In 2012, the Minister of State and the committee members were quite startled by the decline in the population of our rural communities and, in particular, our islands.  Our all-party objective at the time was to try to do something to reverse it and to address the socioeconomic challenges facing our rural communities, including the island communities.  As a result, we had to rely on other reports.  There was a 2009 report relating to a review of fisheries on Ireland's offshore islands and sustaining island livelihoods as well as a report on Gaeltacht islands.  Irrespective of whether they were Gaeltacht islands or English-speaking islands, it is quite clear that there was a historical dependence in offshore island communities on fishing as part of their livelihood.  This had dried up and a source of employment and income was taken from them.<br/><br/>The joint sub-committee on fisheries was established in December 2012 and it commenced its detailed work in 2013 which culminated in a report on promoting sustainable rural, coastal and island communities.  As the Minister of State is aware, during that period we met on eight occasions in public and on nine occasions in private with various group from a wide selection of stakeholders.  There was a detailed consideration of issues arising from the oral and written submissions received as well as the research work undertaken by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  All of this contributed significantly to the development and finalisation of the 29 recommendations in the report, but the report has been sitting there since and my two colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Martin Kenny, have decided that this cannot be allowed to continue.<br/><br/>A significant amount of collective work went into this report and there was all-party agreement on it but report is just sitting there.  We, therefore, took it upon ourselves and sought support from other parties and individuals in the Oireachtas to support the Bill.  We have received an overwhelming response but, unfortunately, the Government has not committed as of yet.  I hope that the Minister of State will give his support to the Bill.  He will be living up to the work he did as Chairman of the committee, which was the genesis of the Bill, and to what he said during the debate at the time.<br/><br/>The motivation behind the Bill is that there is a forgotten community on our islands and in coastal areas.  This community has been consistently neglected by various political parties down through the years and the reason it has been neglected is that it does not have the numbers to make a difference in an election.  That is the reason this community have been neglected and abandoned by the political establishment of the State, and it continues to be the case.  If one looks at how the Common Fisheries Policy works and the distribution of quota and so forth, it is designed and continues to be implemented to facilitate the big beneficiaries at the large end of the scale.  That is wrong.  Our natural resources do not belong to individuals and there is an obligation on all of us, as legislators, to ensure that we treat everyone fairly.  This includes the people who live on our islands.<br/><br/>A huge indictment of the political system is the decline, as Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, in the population on our islands and along the coast since 1986.  There is an obligation on each of us to ensure that we give them fair play and part of giving them fair play is to give them a sustainable income so that they can live where they and their parents and grandparents were born - they have a traditional link to those islands - rather than forcing them to emigrate to America, Australia, England or elsewhere to try to seek out a livelihood and an income.  There is an income off their shore.  A part of a lot of allocations of quota has been a historical track record.  If people are prepared to look, there is a historical track record from our island communities that is going back generations.  It dates back hundreds of years.  They lived and worked and reared their families on the islands.<br/><br/>Recommendation 10 of the report, which is central to the Bill, states:</p><blockquote>The sub-Committee recommends that the Government examines the feasibility of the issuance of 'heritage licences' to rural coastal and island communities.  Such licences would optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices.</blockquote><p>That is the purpose of the Bill, namely, to facilitate this traditional practice.  It is to facilitate an economy on the islands where people can survive and live there.<br/><br/>Dangers have been pointed out.  I spoke to a Minister already and he obviously had not read the Bill.  He told me that our Bill means someone can stand at the end of a pier, wave his licence and give it to someone else to go back out fishing.  This senior Minister had not even read the Bill.  That shows the kind of bull that goes on in here.  People make judgments without even knowing the facts about what they are doing or saying.<br/><br/>There are dangers which have been pointed out, including, for example, granting special terms and conditions for any sector that cause migration of vehicles into the area.  We have dealt with that in the Bill, however.  We made it quite clear that a person has to live on the island, has to be fishing for a living on the island and has to be onboard the fishing vessel.  That is copperfastened.  If people want to look at it, there is also a fallback position.  A prime example is how Tralee Bay Oyster Society works.  Both a licence and a permit are required to fish it.  That is a fallback position.  If the Government has a difficulty, it can insert that into the Bill on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>There is no reason the Government cannot support the Bill.  If the Government has difficulties with the legislation, it can be tweaked.  The Minister of State, when he was Chairman of the committee, stood over the concept.  I am very proud to have played a part in producing the report and I am quite sure the Minister of State is too.  It did an awful lot of good and gave a voice to the voiceless.  These are the forgotten communities.  It gave a voice to them and today we must support the Bill.  Let it go to committee Stage and finally implement a report that has been agreed by all parties in the House.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their references to the committee that I chaired.  When the committee commenced its proceedings, I noted that I was the only member who knew nothing about fishing.  I learned a lot, however, and I appreciate the co-operation of Deputies Pringle and Ferris, who were both members of the committee.  This is a rather unusual situation as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is away on a trade mission and, therefore, unavailable.</p>  <p>  The Department's legal advice is that the Bill is not compatible with EU law and the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I wish to reassure the House, however, that the Government recognises the value and importance of maintaining vibrant rural and coastal communities.  The Action Plan for Rural Development, Realising our Rural Potential, which was launched last year, is a whole of Government strategy aimed at delivering change for people living and working in rural Ireland.  In the sphere of fisheries and seafood production, the Minister has been pleased to launch a range of schemes under Ireland&rsquo;s European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, operational programme for 2014 to 2020.  The EMFF programme is co-funded by the Exchequer and the EU and targets the development of Ireland&rsquo;s seafood industry to support, in turn, the communities reliant on the industry for incomes and jobs.</p>  <p>  I have witnessed the great projects supported by both the north-east and south-east fisheries local action group schemes, FLAGs, supported by the national scheme.  Over the duration of the EMFF programme, the national FLAG scheme will deliver &euro;12 million in funding to Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities.  This is an eightfold increase on the previous scheme.  More than 200 project applications were received under the scheme in 2017.  The final 153 were selected by the FLAG boards for their contribution to community rejuvenation, enterprise, innovation, job creation and skills enhancement across the fishing, aquaculture-----</p></speech>

They include projects such as storage facilities for fishermen, which improve working conditions at harbours and piers, and the promotion of seafood through integration with tourism and community events.</p> <p> Island fishermen and other inshore fishermen can, of course, avail of a range of other schemes, such as the dedicated inshore fisheries conservation scheme with its own &euro;6 million allocation.  This scheme funds the popular lobster V-notching programme, providing direct support to fishermen for engaging in the practice of demarking lobsters for conservation and putting them back to sea to support long-term healthy stocks.</p> <p> I note a particular focus of the Bill is small-scale coastal fishing, which is fishing by vessels of less than 12 m overall length with non-towed gear.  This is a feature of fishing in many of the ports and harbours around our coast, not just the offshore islands.  Small-scale coastal fishing is a commercial activity from which a livelihood is derived.  Under the programme, most of the grants available to small-scale coastal fishermen apply at a rate of 80% of the cost of the investment.</p> <p> Small-scale coastal fishermen are already using Ireland's EMFF programme to invest at very low cost in selective fishing gear, to purchase a wide variety of essential on-board equipment and on-land equipment, such as ice machines and freezers to preserve and add value to catch, or indeed to purchase their first fishing vessel.  To date, over 50% of all payments from the sustainable fisheries scheme have been to small-scale coastal fishermen.  Bord lascaigh Mhara is using the resources of the EMFF programme to provide technical and business advisory services to small-scale coastal fishermen and to assist this important part of Ireland's fishing fleet in the development of fishery management plans and environmental requirements.</p> <p> One of the responsibilities held by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is overseeing Ireland's role in the Common Fisheries Policy.  The CFP is a set of rules for managing European fishing fleets and for conserving fish stocks.  Designed to manage a common resource, fisheries management is based on data and scientific advice, and control measures to ensure that rules are applied fairly and complied with by all fishermen.  A key component of CFP rules is the requirement for a stable and enduring balance between the fishing capacity and the fishing opportunities of each member state.  In this regard the rules lay down requirements for each member state to license every commercial sea-fishing boat in its fishing fleet.  These requirements are legally binding on every member state and are set out in EU regulations.</p> <p> This Bill before us proposes to create a system of licences for individual island fishermen.  However, it cannot be divorced from the requirement to license each sea-fishing boat.  Therefore, all the Bill could hope to achieve is to put island fishermen in the uniquely bureaucratic situation of needing a personal licence and a sea-fishing boat licence.  Entry to and exit from Ireland's fishing fleet is managed through the capacity of each vessel wishing to be registered as an Irish sea-fishing boat with the independent Registrar General of Fishing Boats.</p> <p> Capacity in the form of gross tonnage and engine power has become a privately owned tradeable asset which, with certain exceptions, may be sold, traded or realised as a financial asset on the tonnage market.  I stress it is not an asset owned by the Department or the Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats.  We must be clear here what we are talking about.  Capacity is a privately owned asset by which fishing boat owners can exercise rights to fish on a commercial basis - rights to earn their livelihood.</p> <p> The existing licensing system for sea-fishing boats is administered by the Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in legislation and ministerial policy directives.  The Minister is legally precluded under section 3(5) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 from exercising any power or control in individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned.  Licences issued by the licensing authority are issued to the owners of sea-fishing boats to license the vessel concerned.  The owner may be an individual, a partnership or a corporate body, including a co-operative.  An independent appeals system is available to anyone dissatisfied with a decision of the licensing authority.</p> <p> It is important to point out that the existing licensing legislation and procedures are available to and apply to islanders engaged in commercial sea-fishing.  Island fishermen therefore already have access to a licensing regime which recognises their commercial sea-fishing activities, their right to earn a living from the sea, on the same basis as others in the fishing industry.</p> <p> There are further complexities in how the Irish sea-fishing fleet is managed, including licensing conditions and segmentation.  I do not propose to take up the time of the House going into such details.  Suffice it to say that there are restrictions on the nature of stocks which may be caught, the fishing gear which may be used and the areas in which fishing may be undertaken.</p> <p> This Bill, as I read it, proposes to confer a responsibility on the Minister to issue licences to any person either habitually or ordinarily resident on offshore islands to engage in fishing in a narrowly defined way.  The Bill does not set out how residency would be determined, nor is it clear how the proposed application process would deal with applications by corporate bodies such as co-operatives and partnerships which come under the legal term "person".  I am concerned that the Bill would, if enacted, be open to exploitation by those with very little fishing heritage or island connections.</p> <p> The Bill does not define what is meant by the term "offshore islands" and seems to presume that islands have a six-mile territorial limit.  Many islands around the coastline are contained within the baselines of the territorial seas of the State.  These include the Blasket Islands, the Aran Islands, Inishbofin, Clare Island off Mayo and Arranmore Island off Donegal.</p> <p> The Bill sets out an intention to create a "non-transferable community island quota".  It is long-standing Government policy that Ireland's fish quotas are a national asset.  Ireland's fish quota management system is designed to ensure the best possible spread among fishing vessel operators and also in terms of uptake of quota throughout the year having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions.  Quotas for species which can be obtained using small-scale coastal fishing gear, such as mackerel and herring, already have set-aside allocations for the inshore fishing sector.  Key inshore stocks are not limited by quota arrangements, for instance, lobster and crab species which are the mainstay for many small boats.  I believe Deputy Kenny had this in mind when he referred to artisan fishing.</p> <p> The Bill provides no means of review, repeal, surrender or withdrawal of a licence and provides for no sanctions, offences or enforcement powers to oversee the proposed licensing regime.  These deficiencies demonstrate that the Bill is not fit to address the concerns of island fishermen or any other community dependent on fishing.</p> <p> The Government has made conscious strides to create more inclusive and responsive policies to support and develop communities which are reliant on fishing and seafood production for valuable incomes.  The Government introduced the fishers tax credit in budget 2016 recognising the difficult nature of working in the fishing sector.  I believe this also featured as a recommendation from the committee's report.</p> <p> When I was Chair of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Fisheries, it was evident that no representative body was specifically focused on the inshore sector and the needs of its communities.  The Government moved to address this long-standing challenge by creating the inshore fisheries forums to give inshore fishing communities an effective say in policymaking.  The national inshore fisheries forum, supported by its base of six regional forums, has given the inshore fishing sector its first dedicated platform to provide meaningful input into decisions, such as access to Ireland's fishing quotas, use of funds from the EMFF and conservation measures for inshore stocks, all of which affect how the sector can operate.</p> <p> I understand that island fishermen have representatives on four of the six regional inshore fisheries forums and also on the national inshore fisheries forum, which the Minister, Deputy Creed, regularly meets.  I am, of course, not surprised that island fishermen and their communities have recognised the opportunities being involved in this process bring and how they can contribute to a better long-term future for their sector.</p> <p> The Government is committed to supporting coastal and rural communities, including through the provision of direct financial supports.</p><p>Ireland's EMFF operational programme is focused on the development of the seafood sector and is a critical part of our commitment and I urge all small-scale coastal fishermen on offshore islands and otherwise to avail of the supports in the programme.  I stress that the existing legislation in this area provides an independent licensing process for sea-fishing boats and contributes to managing Ireland's fishing fleet within EU rules.  The existing legislation and procedures are available to and apply to islanders already.  This Bill would conflict with existing legislation and procedures and would create more restrictive licences for islanders than are currently available to them.  That is why the Government, unfortunately, cannot support this Bill.</p></speech>

My parliamentary assistant, Christopher Oonan, has been going there in the summer since he was 12.  His girlfriend's family are from the island and many sets of tyres have been worn out in pursuit of that woman.  To say islands have been ignored by the State would be a serious understatement.  Arranmore is the fifth most populated coastal island in Ireland with a population of 469 in the 2016 census.  As its population was 803 in 1981, there has been a decrease of nearly 50%.  The current unemployment rate is 52% for males and 40% for females.  Almost one in four families on the island are lone-parent families.  This deprivation is not unconnected to the fact that fishing has all but ceased besides that for a few non-quota species.  I will read some words from S&eacute;amus Bonner, a fisherman from Arranmore and secretary of the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation.  He states:</p><blockquote>Seasonal fishing has always been key to the way of life on the islands.  Taking fish when they were at their best and allowing them to recover in the off season is the island way.  Fitting in with the natural way of things comes second nature to islanders.<br /><br />In more recent times a different way of thinking has come about.  Bigger is better is the order of the day.  The outcome of this has been bad for island communities who depend on fishing to make a living and allow islanders to stay on the islands.<br /><br />Instead of a varied fishery, islanders are forced by the existing quota system to fish for non-quota species such as crab and lobster, all year round.  This is not only unsustainable for the islands and puts massive pressure on the few fisheries we have access to.  It cannot last.  The Bigger-is-Better policy has failed us.<br /><br />Small changes can have big effects on the islands, we see the results in our school numbers and our young people having to leave the islands for work.<br /><br />Islanders have recognised the need for change to our way of thinking on fisheries for a long time now.  We have organised, first regionally, then nationally.  Islanders from Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork have come together to work out a way forward.<br /><br />The Joint Oireachtas sub-committee report on fisheries in 2014, which this bill draws its ideas from, charts a way through EU and national rules.<br /><br />The Common Fisheries Policy set by the EU, recognises that islands are different and need special consideration and support.  It is written into the CFP foundations:<br /><br />Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper.&rdquo;<br /><br />The islands heritage license bill being debated today provides for this support.  It allows fair access to CFP quota species so that island fishers can fish seasonally in tune with natural cycles and the weather.<br /><br />It provides for low-impact island boats to earn an income for island families which in turn will support the islands all along our coast.  Small-scale fishing is the way forward for a fairer Common Fisheries Policy.</blockquote><p>I come from a county which does not have much in the way of islands.  We have Bannow Island, which is not really an island, and the Saltee Islands and Keeragh Islands.  In any case, we do not have island fishermen but we do have many fishermen of various shapes and sizes and some, like the island fishermen, have seen their traditional culture slowly eroded by many different factors.  We have salmon net fishermen on our river in the south east.  They used to build traditional cots which they then used primarily to fish and sometimes to race in regattas.  Whenever the season allowed, they used traditional net-fishing practices to catch perhaps one or two salmon a day.  These traditional fishermen were one of the first groups to get the bullet when Inland Fisheries Ireland decided to tackle the decline of the north Atlantic salmon stock.  The major industrial polluters got a pass to warm the waters around our island and further afield.  The agricultural industry got a pass for eutrophication and water extraction on our rivers.  Coastal salmon farmers got a pass to spread sea lice and to forget to report salmon escapes.  There is a tail race on the Slaney where salmon and trout get trapped on a daily basis.  It is the biggest problem facing salmon stocks on the Slaney and Inland Fisheries Ireland pulled out hundreds of fish on a few occasions in recent years.  The same authority cannot tell me how many times it has inspected this tail race because it does not disaggregate inspections.</p><p>My point is simple.  Small, traditional fish catchers on islands or rivers were taken out of the equation.  Major fish killers continued to operate with immunity and are subsidised to continue in many cases.  This Bill seeks to protect a small but important group of fishermen, which I welcome.  While legislation can dictate that certain groups should be allowed to fish, it cannot guarantee fish.  The journey cycle of a salmon is one of the most incredible feats of nature and the obstacles that the north Atlantic salmon faces to survive and spawn are incredible.  The biggest of these obstacles are created by man and until we address these factors that lead to declines in fish stocks, Bills such as this, while important, are somewhat secondary in the bigger scheme of things.  There are many traditional coastal fishermen in Wexford and east Waterford, including Dunmore, Duncannon, and Cheekpoint, who rejected the salmon hardship scheme.  When the Government paid for a buy-out of Irish salmon drifter licences, not everyone sold out.  Some people waited, in good faith, for stocks to recover.  That was 11 years ago and it will be 12 years this summer.  Much of what I have already said about island fishermen and their practices applies to these small-scale coastal fishermen too.  We seem to punish the smaller fishermen and reward the big boats and supertrawlers.</p><p>Conservation of our fish stocks is vital but the traditional fishermen in Wexford and Waterford can still offer a sustainable fishing future.  Most of their boats are under 10 m in length and these fishermen only spend approximately half a year on the water.  Might the Minister support affordable, comprehensive or polyvalent licences and capacity for these men who have been waiting for too long, in recognition of their patience and loss of earnings?  Will the Minister at least meet traditional coastal fishermen in Wexford?  Wexford is consistently shown to be one of the most deprived counties in Ireland, not unlike the economic situation islanders find themselves in.  Surely, we need to consider how the lives of people in these communities have been further devastated by the salmon licence buy-out and lack of improvement in the salmon stock.  All fishermen, whether island, coastal or river, would be served much better if the Government started to tackle the real problems with fish stocks and climate change.</p></speech>

L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn a l&aacute;ithreacht anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  N&iacute; inniu n&aacute; inn&eacute; a thosaigh siad ag teacht anseo.  T&aacute; siad ag teacht anseo thar na blianta fada ag iarraidh br&uacute; a chur orainn cuidi&uacute; leo agus le c&aacute;s na n-iascair&iacute; ar na hoile&aacute;in bheaga.</p>  <p>  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&eacute;ann s&eacute; seo ar fad ar ais go dt&iacute; an cinneadh dul isteach sa Chomhphobal Eorpach, an tAontas Eorpach, mar at&aacute; s&eacute; anois, sa bhliain 1973.  Ina dhiaidh sin, cuireadh an Comhbheartas Iascaigh i bhfeidhm sa bhliain 1983.</p><p>When Ireland became a member of the European Union in 1973, there was no doubt but that it benefited greatly.  This can be seen from our major infrastructure.  Membership gave us free access to 500 million people with whom we could trade our goods and services.</p> <p> I repeat what I have said on numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il and European Parliament, namely, that the fishing industry paid too great a price for membership of the Union.  At the time in question, those who negotiated our membership were of the view that the quotas that would become available in 1983 would be sufficient to allow the industry to develop.  Of course, we have discovered, regrettably, that this has not been the case.  The key that was agreed at that time, when we got some 4.8% in total of the quotas in Europe, and some 21% on a larger scale, or, if it was boarfish, some 90% on a larger scale.  It was not sufficient to allow the industry to develop.</p> <p> Let me return to the subject of the islands.  As I said in Irish, I fully support the Bill, as does my party.  I fully support the measures contained in it.  The Bill, as drafted, may not be perfect.  Those in Sinn F&eacute;in who drafted it would be the first to admit that.  In all my years here, dating back to 1981, I have never seen a Bill that was not amended at all following Second Stage.  Even the Government amends its own Bills.  It will have an opportunity to amend this one.  We may have an opportunity to do so.  We want an opportunity to consider this Bill on Committee Stage.  The Government should not oppose it.  I will go into detail as we go along.</p> <p> It is blatant, given the support this Bill is receiving from the various parties and individuals concerned, that it will go through.  There will be an opportunity when the vote is taken on Thursday of next week to have a rethink.  Not only is the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, present but the Minister of State with responsibility for the islands, Deputy Joe McHugh, is also here.  While this is a marine Bill, it is, as the latter Minister of State would say, fite f&uacute;ite with the islands.  In that context, there has to be joined-up thinking.</p> <p> The Bill would provide young people and those who are not so young with an opportunity to secure a livelihood for themselves and their families and the islands off our coast.  I am very familiar with many of the islands, having represented the Donegal islands during all my years here in the D&aacute;il and the islands off the coasts of Galway and Mayo during my time in the European Parliament.  On those islands, there is no alternative source of employment.  There is an opportunity for fishing and tourism, particularly as they are linked to heritage.  This is a heritage Bill.  We want to give the islanders an opportunity to make a living on their doorstep.  We should remember that we have the most prolific fishing grounds in all of Europe.  The islanders are not in a position to avail of the opportunities presented by those prolific fishing grounds.</p> <p> The Bill recognises the traditional rights of island fishing communities, and it follows on from the recommendation of the joint committee, to which reference has been made.  We have to be positive about this and give credit to the former Chairman of the committee and current Minister of State, Deputy Doyle.  Time does not permit me to go into detail on the recommendations of the committee.  Others have referred to them.</p> <p> I remind the Government that we are not taking this step without precedent.  In 2011, when I was a Member of the European Parliament reviewing the Common Fisheries Policy, I played a lead role on behalf of the party of which I was a member, namely, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, and secured and agreement, not just in ALDE and in the European Parliament but also at the trilogue.  We discussed the matter within the Council, the Parliament and the Commission.  I remind the House that the President of the Council at the time was none other than the present T&aacute;naiste, who was then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He was very supportive of me at that time.</p> <p> It is said that if we agree to this Bill, we will be running into difficulty with Europe.  Europe has agreed that "Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper".  Those were my words but they were adopted by the European Parliament and the trilogue.  They are written into the Common Fisheries Policy.  Therefore, to suggest that we might not be compliant with European guidelines makes no sense.  The joint committee said something similar.</p> <p> Let us have the opportunity to amend the Bill, as necessary.  It may be said that it is not compliant with European legislation.  If it is not, let us make the necessary amendments that make it compliant.  We will work together.  If the Minister of State wants to establish a small working group to table amendments, all of us will be very happy to participate.  The Minister of State says the Bill may not be in conformity with EU legislation.  He should make it conform.  That is what we are here for.</p> <p> On the residency issue, it is suggested in the Bill that one has to be the holder of the licence and that one has to be on board the boat.  It is easy to amend the provision in this regard.  What happens if someone takes ill on the day and there are two or three others on the boat?  These are little amendments we can deal with.  I do not believe they should be regarded as obstacles to proceeding with the Bill.</p> <p> We will give the Government the tools necessary to amend this Bill.  How can we do so?  We can do so by giving the Bill an overwhelming vote of confidence on Thursday of next week, irrespective of whether the Government supports it.  I would like to believe the Government will support it.  If it does not, every Member of this House, whether a member of a party or group or an Independent, will support it.</p> <p> I am delighted because, while I have chaired the proceedings on very many Private Members' Bills, I have never seen as many Members taking an interest as today.  One should remember it is Thursday evening.  This is a fair indication of the commitment of all the parties and individuals concerned.  The full time allowed will be used.</p> <p> Imp&iacute;m ar an Rialtas agus ar na Air&iacute; St&aacute;it at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair leis an gceist seo a fhreagairt thar ceann Roinn na mara agus Roinn na Gaeltachta agus na n-oile&aacute;n smaoineamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille seo agus cinneadh a ghlacadh gan v&oacute;t&aacute;il ina choinne.

I know about and value the benefits of island life, which I have experienced over many years.  The islands have a special, unique atmosphere and way of life, not to mention scenery, natural beauty, peace and tranquility.</p><p>The wide range of skills that islanders have had to develop over the years are also very obvious because they depend on each other so much and that community spirit is evident.</p> <p> I am not looking at islands through rose-tinted glasses because I also know the difficulties, pressures and practicalities of living on islands and the extra costs, in particular of transport of goods and animals on and off the islands, the way islands can be cut off due to adverse weather conditions and the effect of those weather conditions on the infrastructure and roads on the islands.  It is vital that islanders can make a living - a viable income - in order to stay on the islands.  Otherwise, we are going to see an increase in the outward flow to cities and abroad.  We know island populations are falling and the viability of island life is under threat.  We could do without any more Blasket Island scenarios.</p> <p> Islanders have traditionally depended on farming and fishing but life has been particularly difficult for island fishermen.  The Bill goes some way towards addressing those difficulties.  I will use some of the time left to me to refer to what an island fisherman, a young man whom I know, said about the reality of life for him as a fisherman.  He has been fishing all his life since he was a youngster right up to adulthood when he had his own purpose-built 10 m inshore potter.  He invested heavily in that.  He had taken out a mortgage on it but he was forced to downsize to a 20 ft. fibreglass boat a number of years ago.  Part of the reason for downsizing was an inability to make repayments.  He was forced to buy a licence to allow him to fish in an area where he had been fishing all his life and where generations of his family had also fished.  He believes in the importance of regulating access to the fishing industry.  Otherwise, it would be a free for all with unlicensed operators depleting the stocks.</p> <p> In his 20 years fishing he tried to incorporate conservation measures into his fishing activities such as V-notching programmes, minimum size limits, maximum size limits for lobster and brown crab and also voluntary closed seasons.  What he was doing was sustainable and he felt that was vital in order to protect the stocks and ensure viability.  However, he said what is not sustainable is the current licensing system where inshore and part-time island fisherman have to pay huge amounts for a licence.  He said that is preventing any young island fisherman from even considering having a future in the industry, which would otherwise enable them to make a living on the island.  He also said the current licensing structure does not fit with the inshore way of fishing.  It was designed for bigger boats where their ability to catch fish was measured by the amount of power, also known as kilowatts.  Due to those boats becoming even bigger there is a scarcity of kilowatts and it could cost up to &euro;1,000 to buy even one.  I appreciate that talk of kilowatts is another aspect of the issue but the point he is making is that small island fishermen are being forced to compete against the large multinational fishing companies to buy the kilowatts.  His point is that the Government has a responsibility to prevent our natural resources from effectively becoming privatised by monopolies.  In most other countries in the world small inshore boats have a permit that allows them to fish, which is not tied to engine power and so they do not have to compete with the multinational cartels to buy access to the natural resources.</p> <p> The 20 ft. boat he currently uses for fishing is too small to safely fish around the island which is eight miles offshore.  He has to push the boat to its limits in order to make it profitable.  Then he must also steam eight miles to the mainland to land his catch and collect bait often in poor conditions. The current licence does not allow him to upgrade as well as the cost factor being prohibitive.</p> <p>B'fhearr leis fanacht ar an oile&aacute;n, p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa phobal agus lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh ag iascaireacht ach t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe anois as a bhaile d&uacute;chais.  Ba mhaith liom aitheantas speisialta a thabhairt do na hoile&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht agus tac&uacute; leo as an tsl&iacute; ina bhfuil siad ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh leis an nGaeilge chun &iacute; a choime&aacute;d beo.</p> <p> The Bill is going some way towards addressing the issues.  What the Minister said earlier was disappointing but I hope that we can address them on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100034#LL00200"><p>I wish to start by congratulating the island fishermen for sticking with the fight they started, and to be parochial I will mention in particular the fishermen from Donegal.  We started this struggle through the committee in the last D&aacute;il.  It was thanks to the work of then committee Chairman, now Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, that we managed to publish a report.  I know he would like to support the Bill but he had to speak against it today.  That is an anomaly of being in government at this stage, although he was in favour of the report published by the committee under his stewardship.  It is a sad indictment that after all the work carried out by D&aacute;il committees that reports fall on deaf ears within Departments.  I am not just singling out the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the same is true across all Departments in that many committee reports end up lying idle.  For that reason we have introduced the Bill before the House to try to achieve what should have been achieved when the report was first published.</p><p>What is left out of this process is the island fishermen themselves who vested their trust in the Oireachtas to deliver on what is a reasonable demand.  How many fishermen have been pushed further into debt by our inaction?  How many have left fishing entirely and how many have left the islands because we have been unable to carry this process through for them?  I believe that we all lose when someone has to leave an island or give up traditional fishing, in particular when it is due to the inaction of the Government.</p><p>The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 would go some way to showing that the Oireachtas is going to stand up for fishermen and their rights.  This Bill on its own will not reverse the downward trend in the island fishing populations but it would help empower communities further to fight for their own survival and that is the least we should aim to achieve in this House today.  The Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries in its report, Promoting Sustainable Rural Coastal and Island Communities, and in its final recommendations stated that greater support for communities be provided.  In recommendation 10 the report recommends that the Government examine the feasibility of the issuance of heritage licences to rural coastal and island communities.  Such licences would, optimally, facilitate traditional fishing practices.  The following quote from the report sums up the position when it states.</p><blockquote>[In] regard to inshore fisheries, the sub-committee has some concerns.  It would appear that plans advanced to develop the management of inshore fisheries now appear to be in abeyance.  It would also appear that there is a paucity of data, in particular to inshore fisheries in the context of fishing and circumstances of the under 10 metre LOA category of vessel, the bulk of the fleet.  It is clear that it is upon this category that many of the communities, which are the focus of this report, depend to a significant degree economically, socially, demographically and even culturally on inshore fisheries.  In this context, the sub-committee asks the question as to what degree the Government is in a position to plan for the future of this industry and, by extension, these communities.  It appears that there is a very fragmented governance of the maritime sector so the sub-committee also queries whether other, simpler models should not be examined by the Government.</blockquote><p>That says it all.  We need to take a long look at how the Department governs fisheries and find ways to reform that.  It seems to me that the system is definitely broken.  The Bill itself is in line with the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  Article 20 states: &quot;small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper&quot;.  If it was ever appropriate, now is the time.  Section 19 of the CFP states: &quot;Member states should endeavour to give preferential access for small scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen&quot; which further strengthens the support for island fishermen.  I am no friend of the EU but at least in this case the EU is standing up for island fishermen, which we are not doing.  The island communities have looked around Europe to see if such a model exists anywhere else and have found similar models already working.  One example is in Galicia in Spain and this model is based substantially on it.  The Government cannot say that no such approach exists and that it is too difficult, which it probably will try to say here today.</p><p>The island communities have done great work in getting the issue this far, and hopefully we can get them the rest of the way.  However, it would be remiss of me not to mention wider coastal communities and fishermen who are also suffering who could be helped by a similar approach for the very same reasons.  The one drawback that they have is that they do not have the distinct area that an island has and in a lot of cases are working almost alone.  I believe that they should be included in this arrangement and that was the view of the Oireachtas committee as well.  Island communities are not properly represented but that should not make their issue any less important, it just makes it harder for them to get a hearing.</p><p>In conclusion, I wish to say well done to the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IMRO, in getting this far.  I hope this Oireachtas does not let its members down and, by extension, that the Department will honour the recommendations of the committee report and respond to the express wishes of the Oireachtas.</p><p>N&iacute;l drogall ar bith agam mo bhu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt don Bhille seo.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Sinn F&eacute;in as ucht &eacute; a thabhairt os comhair na D&aacute;la.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; foirfe, gan dabht, ach is f&eacute;idir na fadhbanna, na lochtanna agus na laigeachta&iacute; a oibri&uacute; amach ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; an Bille bunaithe ar an tuarasc&aacute;il &oacute;n gcomhchoiste.  Th&aacute;inig an tuarasc&aacute;il sin amach i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir 2014.  Sin ceithre bliana &oacute; shin agus, m&aacute; t&aacute; an t-am agam, tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il sin.  T&aacute; na molta&iacute; ann iontach ar fad.  Faraor g&eacute;ar n&iacute; cuireadh i bhfeidhm iad ach t&aacute; 29 moladh i gceist.  T&aacute; an Bille seo bunaithe go pr&iacute;omh&aacute; ar moladh 10.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; an Bille i bhfad n&iacute;os srianta n&aacute; an moladh mar luaitear sa Bhille na hiascair&iacute; at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar oile&aacute;in agus n&iacute; luaitear ar chor ar bith na daoine at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar an m&oacute;rth&iacute;r in aice na farraige.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith srianta agus n&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil an Rialtas 100% taobh thiar den Bhille seo.</p> <p> I am fully behind the Bill.  It is certainly not perfect and it has problems but they can be worked out on Committee Stage.  Indeed, the Bill is based on the report produced at an earlier stage by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle.  The Minister of State has been praised, and rightly so.  I have taken the trouble of downloading the report and reading it.</p> <p> Four years ago, the now Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, stood over what I would term as a radical document.  Unfortunately, from what I can see, none of the 29 recommendations has been implemented.  Today, in particular, we are considering recommendation 10.  The Sub-committee on Fisheries chaired by the now Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, recommended that the Government examine the feasibility of the issuance of heritage licences to rural coastal and island communities.  Such licences would, the recommendation suggested, optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices and so on.  This Bill is far more restrictive than the recommendation.  It simply refers to fishermen habitually living on islands.  It is also limited by the nature of the licence, which is a non-transferable heritage licence, and the boat size referenced is particularly small.</p> <p> I have before me the response of the Minister of State.  T&aacute; trua agam don Aire St&aacute;it mar bh&iacute; s&eacute; 100% taobh thiar den tuarasc&aacute;il seo agus anois t&aacute; s&eacute; ina shu&iacute; agus n&iacute;l s&eacute; in ann taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille srianta seo.  Bheadh mise ag s&uacute;il le Bille i bhfad n&iacute;os leithne &oacute;n Rialtas agus go h&aacute;irithe &oacute;n Aire St&aacute;it de bharr an m&eacute;id oibre a rinne s&eacute; sa tuarasc&aacute;il.  I feel sorry for the Minister of State in a sense.  He has done tremendous work and has come up with good recommendations.  One in particular was altogether radical and lifted my heart: recommendation 6.  Reference is made to a clear need for a statutory financial community gain in respect of agriculture and marine energy projects.  Of course that recommendation was never realised.  I do not think any of the recommendations has ever been implemented.</p> <p> The Minister of State has stood behind recommendation 10.  The Bill is far more restrictive than that recommendation.  He cannot even agree to change the Bill in that regard on Committee Stage.</p> <p> An adage comes to mind - the devil will quote scripture to suit his purpose.  Certainly, I do not attribute any satanic characteristics to the Minister of State.  However, he quotes from the Common Fisheries Policy to suit himself.  Yet, he has ignored the preamble, which has already been referenced by my colleagues, paragraph 20 of which states: "Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper."</p> <p> There are other references to helping islands enjoy sustainable life.  The Minister of State referred to the difficulties of the reference to "habitually resident".  Family law legislation has many uses of the term "habitually resident" without a problem for the purposes of judicial separation, divorce and other issues in family law.</p> <p> I recognise that the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is in a difficult position, but that is the time to show leadership.</p></speech>

As Deputy Gallagher said, many of us have stayed around to contribute to this Bill and that only serves to emphasise its importance.</p>  <p>  I compliment the Sinn F&eacute;in Party on bringing forward the Bill and on making a significant contribution in this area.</p>  <p>  The Bill is about the future of island communities and small fishermen.  It is a signal to these people, our people, that they are not being forgotten.  It is clear to everyone that small-scale island fishermen have struggled for survival.  In a brilliant article last July, Lorna Siggins wrote about Ireland's islands and how the offshore islands were fighting depopulation and neglect.  People on the islands have felt abandoned at times.  I know the story of one such fisherman.  Many people know him although I do not.  His name is John O'Brien from Arranmore in Donegal.  The article neatly encapsulated why this Bill is so important.  It has the clear objective of formalising the recognition in Ireland for small offshore islands that are dependent on fishing.  Mr. O'Brien clearly struggled after he and several other fishermen on Arranmore refused to surrender their wild salmon licences when the ban on drift netting came into operation in 2007.  He refused a compensation package.  In a brilliant film for TG4, "A Turning Tide in the Life of Man / I mB&eacute;al na Stoirme" by the French film producer Loiec Jourdain the seed or idea of heritage licences for fishing tied to a cultural link to a specific area emerged.  Mr. O'Brien&rsquo;s advocacy and awareness was the acorn for this concept.  It was all about a refusal to dispose of the rights of his children and grandchildren.  That acorn started to grow and was strengthened as a result of the report referenced already this evening on promoting rural, coastal and island communities from the Sub-Committee on Fisheries.  I have been a member of agriculture committees for the past 20 years, but I think I was out of favour for a year or so around that time the sub-committee deliberated and so I was not involved.  The sub-committee operated under the chairmanship of the now Minister of State, Deputy Doyle.  The report was published in January 2014.</p>  <p>  Mr. O'Brien did not stop after his initial efforts.  He went to the European Parliament and, with his colleagues, achieved the insertion of a clause in the Common Fisheries Policy allowing member states to protect island communities.  He has already secured a major achievement.  The idea of people telling us that our aims cannot be achieved is simply ceding far too easily to legal advice.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the introduction of non-transferable community quotas for the islands that would be facilitated through the issuing of heritage licences to island fishermen in order to carry out traditional island fishing practices.  Seasonal small-scale coastal fishing could be a life-saver for these communities, since it would help to sustain employment and thereby communities.  In turn, this would help in the retention of school facilities and other important infrastructure on the islands.  If we do not take proactive steps to sustain and maintain the island populations by specific policy measures, such as those contained in this simple but effective Bill, then the population will drift and disappear and important parts of our culture, heritage, music, language and dialect will be lost forever.  I recognise that the Bill may well have to be refined and amended.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that the ongoing losses suffered by Ireland's indigenous and sustainable island fishing communities are undermining the cultural life of our coastal peoples as they struggle and grapple each day with the threat of impending further losses.  If this is allowed to continue without positive intervention, such as the measures as set out in the Bill, the fabric of coastal communities will inevitably disappear.</p>  <p>  Other EU member states have argued successfully for heritage status for their islands.  Yet, we are an island country but we have been tardy and reticent about our ambition to achieve the objective that Mr. O'Brien and his fellow brave fishermen have sought.  This is our opportunity.  If there is an EU objection to our reservation, we should tell those responsible to get stuffed.  We have been craven long enough.  The Sub-committee on Fisheries set out 29 recommendations to help and assist coastal communities in activities such as aquaculture, inshore fishing, tourism and seaweed activities.  As I have said, the issuing of heritage licences under recommendation 10 can be instantly achieved by facilitating the passing of this legislation.</p>  <p>  The sub-committee prepared a comprehensive report that necessitated many meetings, work and scrutiny.  The recommendations are instructive.  The sub-committee recommended that the Government should examine the feasibility of heritage licences to be issued by the Department for rural coastal communities representing and facilitating traditional fishing practices.</p>  <p>  Let there be no more beating around the bush: let us stop kowtowing and adopting a subservient attitude to the EU Commission.  These can be facilitated within the terms of the current Common Fisheries Policy framework.  As far as I can see, the EU Commission seems to be generally happy or eager to support proposals if they facilitate the privatisation of our vital natural resources.</p>  <p>  Various amendments can be made and if deficiencies exist in the Bill they can be remedied on Committee Stage.  Definitions can be refined and appeal systems can be included.</p><p>As Deputy Martin Kenny stated, small-scale coastal fishing is defined as fishing from vessels less than 12 m in length and not using towed fishing gear.  This is a precise legislative definition which the Labour Party unequivocally supports.  As Deputy Kenny noted, this form of artisan fishing contrasts favourably with fishing by large vessels and super-trawlers which catch all before them and cause small fishermen to lose out.<br/><br/>For a century, the Labour Party has supported and worked with our island communities.  I refer to the work done by Deputies, Senators, councillors and members of my party, from the former Deputy Michael McCarthy in Cork South West to the former Councillor Seamus Rodgers in County Donegal.  Last July, Mr. Rodgers contacted the Labour Party Parliamentary Party immediately to ensure that we would support the Bill proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Fair play to Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies for being networked; they do not miss a trick.<br/><br/>Every year on Arranmore, the island on which the Bill was launched, the life of the great socialist campaigner, Peadar O&rsquo;Donnell, is celebrated.  Peadar, a socialist republican and lead organiser for the ITGWU, never forgot his roots in Donegal.  He wrote the acclaimed book <i>Islanders</i>in 1928.  The Islanders Weekend, which is held in his memory, is a unique event which examines how to make life more sustainable on our islands.  The theme of September's gathering was &quot;islands on the edge&quot; and what could be done to make life more sustainable on our islands.<br/><br/>As a Deputy from an inland county, I am not familiar with coastal areas but I read about many of the issues to bring myself up to speed.  I would be much more informed if we were discussing lake fishing.  I had a busy two days reading the report on fisheries produced by the joint committee in 2012.<br/><br/>The Bill is welcome and timely and I applaud Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies for introducing it.  If we are to support our island communities, there must be a commitment to sustaining a livelihood.  Fishing is the resource closest to them.<br/><br/>The Bill was launched on the island of Arranmore by Deputies Martin Kenny and Pearse Doherty, and I know Deputy Martin Ferris also contributed to drafting it.  Arranmore is an interesting example because it was the first offshore island to be connected under the rural electrification scheme in 1957, more than 60 years ago.  Today, the D&aacute;il debated the provision of broadband to 524,000 people living in rural areas who still do not have access to a service.  They include places such as Ballynacarrigy, Ballymore, Castletown Geoghegan, Colehill and Lenamore in my constituency.  My parish of Ballynacarrigy was divided up for the purpose of delivering broadband, which meant we could look up to the road and see works being done in Sonna.  Arranmore Island got electricity in 1957.  It is an absolute disgrace that broadband is not available in a large area such as Ballynacarrigy.  The quicker it is provided the better.  I would not like to think it will take hundreds of years.  If the Government cannot give islands a proper connection to the modern world, it should at least allow islanders to fish the waters off their shores to try to eke out a living and pass it on to their offspring.<br/><br/>Peadar O'Donnell championed the rights of seasonal potato pickers who had to travel to Scotland.  I have no doubt he would have been at the forefront of the campaign to ensure the Bill is enacted.  The challenges Peadar O'Donnell faced in organising workers still exist, albeit in different forms.  While the gig economy benefits some, it does not offer sustainable jobs with decent terms and conditions.<br/><br/>Fishing has traditionally been a mainstay for our islands and this Bill would ensure guaranteed rights and some chance of maintaining a population on them.  For this reason, the Labour Party unambiguously and unequivocally supports it.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il fosta as a bheith &aacute;balta in &eacute;ineacht le mo chomhghleacaithe i Sinn F&eacute;in an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a mholadh.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to see so many Deputies contributing to the debate.  It appears not all those who wish to speak will have their voices heard.  It is good that there is such demand to speak on this legislation.  I am pleased to be able to sponsor this Bill with my party colleagues, Deputies Martin Ferris and Martin Kenny.  Some months ago, I had the pleasure of accompanying Deputy Kenny to Arranmore Island off the coast of Donegal where together we launched this significant Bill.  I also presented it on Tory Island earlier this year.</p>  <p> The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill is both significant and historic because it seeks to put an end to the years of decline we have unfortunately witnessed for all too long in our offshore island populations.  In drafting the legislation, Sinn F&eacute;in worked closely and in consultation with the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO, which is dedicated to promoting and defending island fishing communities.  The origins of the IIMRO lie in the long struggle of Donegal island fishermen to achieve recognition of their rights.  This followed the offshore ban on salmon fishing in 2006, which was closely followed in 2008 by the ban on all net fishing in waters known as Area 6A.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that a number of IIMRO members are in the Gallery.  They include Arranmore native, Jerry Early, and Seamus Bonner, who has been mentioned, as well as others who have been instrumental in developing, promoting and campaigning for the Bill before the House.  It is only right that we pay tribute to these individuals for the role they have played in bringing the plight of island fishing communities to the fore.  Without them, this Bill would not have seen the light of day.  It was they who nurtured it.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies referred to the report of the joint committee.  I commend the Chairman of the committee at the time, the current Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle.  The driving force for the report was the island communities, particularly on Arranmore.  They wrote to the joint committee demanding to have their voices heard.  Thankfully, the committee listened and gave them a voice.  It then produced a report in which it recommended the legislation before the House.  This speaks to the length of time people on the islands have been campaigning for their rights.</p>  <p>  I referred to the organisation which was established before the national and regional inshore fisheries forums.  Many would argue that it was the work of the IIMRO that led to the establishment of these forums.  S&iacute;lim go mba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leo as a gcuid iarrachta&iacute; go dt&iacute; seo agus iad f&oacute;s i mbun feachtais chun aitheantas a bhaint amach maidir le cearta iascair&iacute; na n-oile&aacute;n.  Feachtas &eacute; seo n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in in Eirinn.  Feachtas &eacute; a bh&iacute; curtha os comhair &uacute;dar&aacute;is na hEorpa fosta ag an t-oile&aacute;nach John O&rsquo;Brien agus cruach&aacute;s na n-iascair&iacute; l&eacute;irithe go soil&eacute;ir sa scann&aacute;n "A Turning Tide in the Life of Man".</p>  <p>  When I use the term "cruach&aacute;s" or "hardship" in English, no one in this Chamber should think for one second that it not an appropriate way to describe the difficulties our island fishing communities have been forced to contend with through the years.  These are the communities of Tory, Arranmore and many other islands where fishing has long played a central role not only in the local economy, but in island life more broadly.  This brings us to the nub of the issue and the reason the Bill is so important.  If enacted, it will ensure, for the first time, that island based fishing communities have their rights to practice their long established traditional fishing methods protected and recognised by law.  These are rights and freedoms which successive Governments failed to protect and defend for years.  This failure to stand up for island communities has seen many of their inhabitants having their livelihoods unfairly robbed of them.  It has meant that a once proud fishing people have been all but barred from fishing the very waters which surround the place they call home.</p>  <p>  Let us put ourselves in their shoes for just one moment.  A couple of weeks ago, when I spoke about the Bill on Tory Island, I had these very thoughts and I had them again earlier this week when I looked out at the Atlantic ocean from Arranmore Island.  Imagine being the son or daughter of a fisherman from Tory Island and despite the waters around the island having been a means of sustaining and supporting one's family for generations, these same waters are now forbidden territory.  That is the shocking and shameful reality facing island fishing communities and it must not be allowed to continue. </p>  <p>  The Minister may wish to nitpick about the Bill, find flaws in it or use smoke and mirrors to deflect from it.  However, if he genuinely believes in the future of island communities, he should agree to work together on it.  One way or another, with or without Government support, this Bill will pass. </p><p>I ask the Minister of State, his officials and his Department to get on board, so that we bring in the best heritage licence Bill we can and we make sure that the reality I described about staring at waters ripe with fish but in which islanders are forbidden to fish is no longer the reality.  This Bill is an effort to right that wrong.  Our Bill is designed to facilitate the continuation of traditional fishing methods which have sustained island populations for centuries.  If enacted, through exploiting the limited scope which exists within the Common Fisheries Policy framework, this legislation will allow for the provision of dedicated ring-fenced and non-transferable quotas on our offshore islands.  It will provide for the issuing of licences to island fishermen habitually resident on these islands who engage in small-scale coastal fishing to earn a living.  In an effort to ensure this legislation is robust, that its provisions are lawful and that the integrity of the legislation is maintained, we have purposefully included a number of restrictions.  These are to ensure that the quota cannot be transferred to anybody else and that the licences cannot be traded or sold off, as has happened in the past.</p> <p> Let me be clear.  This Bill will not completely undo the imbalances in our current fishing laws, which are unfairly tipped the balance in favour of the select few.  However, I believe passionately that this legislation will go some way towards ensuring that small island fishermen have a future in which islanders can fish their waters without fear, with impunity and, most importantly, with a future where they can have hope, not just for themselves, but for their islands and for generations of islanders to come.  Seo &eacute; f&aacute;th nach bhfuil aon drogall orm an Bhille seo a mholadh don Teach.</p> <p> I plead with the Minister of State.  As I said, this legislation is going to pass, so I call on him to get on board.  I said to the island community and the fishermen on both Tory and Arranmore that we have the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour party and the Independents.  There are enough people in this House who support this concept, but I told them that is not good enough.  What we want is for this House to speak with one voice.  This is even bigger than the issue of the right to fish for island communities.  This will represent the House saying that we recognise island communities as special and distinct, and we are willing to carve out a space in Irish law for them, in recognition of the challenges and difficulties that have been placed on them by Governments and by nature.  That is what this is about, so I appeal to the Minister of State not to call a vote on this Bill.</p> <p> Let this House stand together and send a signal to the fishermen who travelled here today from our offshore islands, from offshore Donegal and elsewhere, and to those who were not able to travel but who want to hear that now they have a Government and a Parliament that recognise their identity and challenges and want to do something to make sure they have a future in the place they call home and that they love, the offshore islands.</p></speech>

I commend the work of the committee which made this recommendation and Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing forward this Bill on the back of that recommendation.  I welcome the fishing representatives from our islands in the Visitors Gallery.  </p><p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, on his role, which has been remarked on by previous speakers, in chairing that committee and putting that valuable report together.  It is absolutely crucial that these reports and recommendations are not just published but that they are acted on.  The report of the committee the Minister of State chaired followed previous reports in the 2000s.  There were two - in 2003 and 2007 - if I recollect correctly but their were two in previous years.  It is crucial we see those recommendations put in place.  There is no doubt that our island communities have suffered tremendously.  As new jobs have been created in the wider economy, some in new sectors, these new jobs have not arrived on our islands.  At the same time, the traditional jobs have been leaving them.  As a result, incomes have been reduced, and the islands have experienced emigration in a way that other parts of the country have not.  The income levels are much lower and all the statistics show that to be the case.</p><p>Those who live on the islands, however, are very dedicated, committed and loyal to their way of life and make the very best of the resources that are available to them.  It is absolutely crucial that, from a national policy point of view, we try to assist and work with them.  I commend the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation on the work it has done in pioneering this.  I know from the Minister of State's contribution that he has a concern with the Bill and may not support it.  However, I would point out to him that cross-party support means the Bill can go forward but that should not happen with the Government digging in its heels and trying to resist it.  I encourage the Minister of State to embrace the Bill and work with it.  If it requires amendment, let us have that debate on Committee Stage where that can be facilitated.  The Bill can be added to and teased out further, as required.</p><p>The overall objective of 1% of quota, which is what has been indicated will be required, is not significant in the round.  However, it will be particularly significant and important if allocated to the islands, specifically to island-based fishermen.  The letter all Deputies received from Seamus Bonner of the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, in the name of the chairperson, Jerry Early, outlined very clearly the importance of the Bill.  In the letter, Mr. Early wrote:</p><blockquote>The ongoing losses suffered by Ireland's indigenous and sustainable island fishing communities are undermining the cultural life of our coastal peoples and they live every day with the threat of further losses.  Making a living out of the sea is not just about fishing, it is a way of life and fundamental to the fabric of life in coastal communities.<br /><br />People are sustained not just by the food and income it supplies, they are sustained by the songs, stories and ancient traditions it inspires.  Ireland's islanders have been farmers and fishermen for generations, living in harmony with the needs of the land and the environment.  However, current and future generations of island-dwellers are forced to emigrate or move to the cities, this unique way of life is being lost.</blockquote><p>That puts it very well and puts the onus on us, as legislators, to ensure the life, incomes and cultural lifestyle of our islands, which are so important to the fabric of our country, can be maintained and to work with them to support that.  </p><p>As spokesperson for agriculture, I must point out that in the areas of natural constraint scheme, there is a special category for islands, which pays at the maximum rate, in recognition of the fact that farming is more difficult on islands.  We should do the same where fishing is concerned.</p><p>I support this Bill and I urge the Minister of State to allow it to go to Committee Stage with his co-operation rather than resistance.  I call on him to work with all parties in the D&aacute;il to ensure this very worthwhile objective comes to fruition so that we can support our island fishermen and communities.</p></speech>

Everything should be done to enhance island living.  The Common Fisheries Policy provides for small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing and efforts should be made to enable them to survive.  The idea of heritage licences is set out in the Oireachtas report, a report which was endorsed by an all-party Oireachtas committee in 2014.</p>  <p>  As stated by my colleagues, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the main principles of this Bill and its passage on Second Stage.  Island fishermen live and work in a harsh and unpredictable environment.  Therefore, this Bill is all about fairness.  Aside from this, the fishing sector is an essential part of the Irish economy, with Bord Bia advising that seafood exports amounted to &euro;645 million in 2017.  This is particularly relevant in light of Brexit.  A hard Brexit would be detrimental to the fishing industry in Ireland.  The Government needs to prioritise this and take a firm stance in regard to future trade links.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 10 of the report calls for the Government to examine the feasibility of the issuance of heritage licences to rural, coastal and island communities.</p><p>Such licences would essentially facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain length in designated areas.</p> <p> I am speaking from the perspective of islands in West Cork where traditional fishing practices are, unfortunately, being eradicated.  Once this unique and beautiful tradition, which is synonymous with Irish culture, fades out, it will be lost forever.  In that regard, there is an urgent need to attract younger people into the fishing sector, but the future is far from certain.  Specifically, I refer to Sherkin Island in my constituency.  I am advised that nobody is working in the fishing industry on the island.  The last remaining fisherman, a young person incidentally, decided there was no future in fishing, or in island living, and he left the island in the past few months to live on the mainland.  Islanders on Sherkin, Cape Clear and Bere Island advise that no assistance is made available to them and even if they decide to stay on the island they are impeded by over-regulation.  It is simply too hard to live off the ever decreasing remuneration derived from fishing.</p> <p> The industry needs to be attractive but, more important, it needs to be viable.  The West Cork Islands Interagency Group believes that the viability of the fishing sector will assist them in their objective to increase the population of our islands.  Heritage licences are a lifeline to the fisheries sector.  Strict regulations, which would limit the issuing of licences, would guarantee that those most deserving and in most need would receive same - essentially, those habitually resident on the island and those with vessels no longer than 12 m.  This measure will ensure that small inshore fishing will survive and prosper.  The Fianna F&aacute;il policy paper seeks to build on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way by creating an &ldquo;Irish Way&rdquo;.  Any progress needs to ensure that all sectors prosper and none is left languishing behind, which is currently the case, unfortunately, with the fishing sector.</p> <p> I reiterate that the Government must make fisheries a top priority.  The introduction of heritage licences would demonstrate the Government's commitment to this industry and in that regard I call on the Ministers of State and the Government to act accordingly.</p></speech>

It is also important to recognise the island community representatives who are present to outline and highlight the significance of being from an island.  I will get into my car following the debate and I will get a late dinner but they do not know whether they will make the last ferry this evening.  That is the significance and hard reality of living on an island and that has to be emphasised again and again.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, prepared an excellent cross-party report and his heart is in the right place.  He has the backing of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne and myself, and I have spoken to the Taoiseach at length regarding the issue.  We want to do something within the parameters of the law and what is possible.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we have an issue with process.  Sinn F&eacute;in will win the vote later because it has the support of the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il but there is a difficulty with process.  The Ceann Comhairle and I try to tease this out day in, day out under the new political regime.  Upwards of 25 Private Members' Bill have passed Second Stage but they are sitting in a vacuum.  We have to consider what will happen after the Bill passes Second Stage.  It will go to the joint committee but not to Committee Stage.  The committee will have to go through all the issues raised by the Department and the legal concerns raised by the Attorney General.  However, that is the forum in which these will be debated and where all parties will tease them out.  It will not go to Committee Stage even at that point.  Following the joint committee's deliberations, a money message will be needed for the legislation and we are having difficulty with that.</p>  <p>  We have the principle of this issue at heart.  Representative organisations along the coastline have made submissions but I would like inshore fishermen to get a leg up as well as the islands and nobody opposes that.  Singling out the islands is symbolic and we need to go a step further.  I want to pursue this issue as best I can.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, has the knowledge of the islands in his constituency and we are having a cross-party discussion now.  However, this is a process.  What we do next will create expectation when the Bill passes Second Stage because Sinn F&eacute;in has the numbers.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, Enda Kenneally and Seamus Bonner, whom I have met on a number of occasions both during the discussion on the committee report chaired by Deputy Andrew Doyle and in preparation for the debate.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the inland fisheries sector, I have mentioned my concerns regarding salmon.  They pointed out that while they are not impacted by the Bill, they are not mentioned.  </p></speech>

I want to register my concern because there are international agreements.  Ireland is a member of NASCO.  It is important that as many salmon from Irish rivers as well as those of other countries migrate to Greenland or the Faroe Islands to feed before returning to those rivers to feed.  The prospect of successfully restricting Greenlandic and Faroese fisheries to protect our indigenous stocks is greatly reduced if we inappropriately manage domestic and international stocks off our own coast.</p><p> I would like to point out that the Atlantic salmon is, of course, protected under the EU habitats directive, with which Ireland's salmon management regime complies.  There is always spirited debate on rivers that are opened and closed under the catch and release system.  Any deviation from current policy would run contrary to the international independent scientific advice which suggests the home river of offshore salmon cannot be identified and that it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals stock groups at sea.  In view of Ireland's commitment to the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, NASCO, principles and our obligations under the EU habitats directive and the Common Fisheries Policy, as outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, I have to register my concerns on these matters with reference to the Bill.  That said, I register my support for the principle of the Bill, that is, support for island communities.  I find the current fisheries policy across Europe and in this country as part of it not to be fit for purpose.  There is a general principle that larger ships are generally safer and that we must accept that the safety of fishermen is hugely important, but the general policy of concentrating fishing quotas in the hands of a few is one which is unsustainable and very difficult to justify morally, environmentally or economically.  I acknowledge that the Bill goes some of the way in protecting island communities and giving them a livelihood.  I acknowledge the work and support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  With the Ministers of State, Deputies Joe McHugh and Andrew Doyle, I have had long discussions with the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, on this matter.  I support the general principle of the Bill, but as I said, I register my concerns about salmon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-02-01a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018020100039#QQ00200"><p>First, I welcome the representatives of the fishing communities on the various islands who are in the Visitors Gallery to listen to the debate.  I failed to do so at the start.  It has been a lengthy debate during which many views have been contributed, but the consensus seems to be that Members are supportive of the Bill.  In fairness, even the Ministers of State have said they are in favour of its broad principle.  However, there are a number of issues which were raised in the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle's contribution which I would like to address, including the notion that the Bill gives one group entitlements above others.  Yes, it does and unapologetically so.  If we think about it, every citizen 18 years and older is entitled to put himself or herself forward for election to this Chamber, yet we have rules which state parties must select a certain quota of women candidates.  Therefore, we favour some potential candidates over others for the simple reason that we have a problem in that we do not have enough women Members.  Deputy Charlie McConalogue mentioned, as I had intended to do, the areas of natural constraint schemes under which special payments are made on the islands and in mountain areas.  There are umpteen examples of the Government acknowledging in law special circumstances.  It happens everywhere we go.</p>  <p>  Another issue I want to raise is that the Government representatives say the Bill is too narrowly defined.  They suggest residents of an offshore island who are engaged in fishing are defined too narrowly.  They have also asked how residency will be determined.  All of these issues can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  That is how we deal with these things.  The Bill would be 20 pages long if we were to go into detail on everything.  We have to deal with these issues on Committee Stage.  When we reach that Stage when we will actually put licences in place, as we hope we will, it will be up to us to ensure the Minister will put in place the conditions and restrictions needed.  The Bill does not define the term "offshore island".  There are already definitions of it.  Therefore, the Bill does not need to define it, but we will deal with that issue when the Bill is taken on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  It is long-standing Government policy that Ireland's fish quota is a national asset.  I took that point from the Minister of State's contribution.  It certainly is a national asset.  Therefore, as a Government and an assembly, we have the power and ability to decide how to use it for the benefit of the people and in the national good.  It is my view and, I believe, that of the majority of Members that the national good will be served by marking off a small portion of the quota and ensuring it is given to island fishermen in order that they can continue to sustain their communities.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has said the Bill provides for no means of review, appeal, surrender or withdrawal of a licence.  Again, that is an issue to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  He has also said the Bill is not a serious attempt to address the concerns of island fisherman.  That brings me to the obvious question: was his committee not serious about its report?  The need for a Bill such as this was part of it.  If he is saying it is not a serious attempt, he is saying the work his committee did and the report it produced were not serious.  More questions arise from his contribution than answers.  The first part dealt only with the various grants and subsidies available to all fishermen.  All fishermen know about them because they absolutely need them to survive.  In fairness, he was speaking about inshore fishermen.</p>  <p>  The issue of salmon management raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, is interesting.  We did hear talk about salmon coming up rivers being affected.  The reality is that, as stated in the Bill, we are talking specifically about quota species.  As there is no quota for salmon, the species will not be affected.</p></speech>

We have responsibilities to ensure everyone has a fair chance in life.  I was on Arranmore with Deputy Pearse Doherty earlier this year.  It struck me that the island was so much apart and a place aside.  It was apart from the rest.  It is separated by a huge body of water and surrounded by an ocean which quite often is violent, yet we have to remember that it and the people who live on it are still a part of the country.  That is the key point.  We are trying to set out something which will ensure those who live on the islands, thee vibrant communities that want to have a future, will have it and set out a place where they can have it.</p>  <p>  Nobody is going to tell me that some multinational corporation will be brought in to set up an industry on the islands.  That is not going to happen.  We have to recognise that the islands have a difficulty and that the only way in which we can sustain them is by ensuring access to the natural resources around them - the ocean and the bounty it gives.  Farming is difficult on the islands.  We have to ensure their communities have the opportunity to fish the sea, as they have always done.  That is what the Bill attempts to do.</p>  <p>  On the difficulties the Ministers of State have raised, we accept that there may be difficulties and things which will need to be dealt with.  They can all be dealt with on Committee Stage.  We can get through all of them.  </p>  <p>  On the point made about the legislative process and the difficulties with so many Bills in the queue and so on, is that a reason to stop doing things?  It certainly is not.  I appeal to the Government to recognise what is happening.  The Bill is going to go through.  It will be a huge show of respect for the island communities if it receives the unanimous support of everyone in the House.  At the end of the day, we have to stand up to the bureaucrats who will always find a reason not to do something.  In my view and that of most people who have looked at this issue, there are a small number of civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who, for a number of decades, have destroyed the fishing industry in Ireland, even more than the European Union has.  The Minister of State and the Government need to stand up to them.  That is the first clink in the armour.  This is the first time we can do something for the people, not for those who tell us that we cannot do things because there are rules.  Rules can be changed.  </p>  <p>  The point was made that there was something illegal in the Bill.  Is this not where we decide what is legal or illegal?  Is this not where we make things legal if it is right to do so?  The Bill is right.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government one last time to come forward, step up to the mark, support the Bill and its progress through the various Stages and do something for the ordinary decent people who live on offshore islands to reflect the care the rest of the community has for them.  Everyone in every part of the country has huge empathy for the people who live on offshore islands and the hardship they go through.  We have an opportunity to do something that reflects that empathy.  I again appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to join everyone in this Chamber to give the Bill unanimous support.  I commend the Bill to the House and propose that it move forward.</p></speech>
